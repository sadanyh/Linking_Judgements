The wife is represented in the Nigerian jurisdiction, has appeared there throughout by her Nigerian lawyers. She has apparently never taken the jurisdictional point there, that is she did not challenge the jurisdiction of the Nigerian court to determine the divorce suit and has not only acquiesced in the process but has taken positive steps in the same, for example, issuing a cross petition and obtaining orders for substituted service. Were the courts in Nigeria to come to an appropriate conclusion, she would on the facts of her own case as pleaded here, have the right to apply in the United Kingdom for permission to make an application in relation to the United Kingdom assets of the couple, and he goes on to complain that her evidence is defective. But on page 212 he says, I've come to the following conclusions as reasons for the decision I have made. And those are set out numbers one to eight.

And then just skipping a paragraph, he said, in my judgement, the wife has established that it is appropriate for the English court to intervene where she has been resident here since 1999 and where I am satisfied that she will continue to make her main home here, where she has her doctor and her English state benefits. I am satisfied that she is not misleading the court with a false case, and this is an appropriate case for an order, despite the Nigerian proceedings. So, My Lords, we say that she was acquitted of of the Law Commission's main concern about foreign shopping. The Law Commission has considered that the regime that they wanted to provide for would be a flexible discretionary regime, and if I could ask you please to go back to the authorities bundle, bundle 1.
1	p3,01:01:09.910,01:02:55.430,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And then, set out in numbers 1 to 8, which echo in almost identical language the paragraphs of Section 25(2) of the 1973 Act so subject to this one difference, which I say is a more technical and formal than real difference. Namely, that the Nigerian court had no power to make ancillary -- to make a transfer of property order, that the statute under which it was operating was remarkably similar to the English statute, indeed was plainly, uh, inspired by and drawn from the English statute at some stage in its evolution. Because the language, the echo of language, can't be a pure coincidence, and that the approach of the Nigerian court was to award the wife a home for her life and a lump sum, which reflected its view of the appropriate level of capitalist maintenance in all the circumstances of the case and subject again to this one difference of the property being settled rather than transferred outright, That is exactly how English courts would approach the vast majority of cases before the decision of the House of Lords in White and White less than 10 years again. And it is quite impossible, we submit, to say that the approach of the Nigerian court was not broadly comparable to that of the English court, which we say is the correct test per M and M, when what it was doing was very, very close to what the English court would have done until less than 10 years ago.
1	p3,00:31:12.600,00:32:02.180,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The next authority in time is that of the Court of Appeal in Jordan at divider 7 where what in effect was being attempted, was to use Part 3 to enforce an order which had been made in California. But again, there are wide observations, and if we can turn to the judgment of Lord Justice Thorpe at 219, letter F, Of course, the paradigm case creating the need for the legislation was the case where the decree of the Foreign Court was entitled to recognition in this jurisdiction, but where that court did not offer any rights to financial provision either at all or alternatively on any basis comparable to the rights arising under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in this jurisdiction. The opening sentences of the Law Commission report so state.
1	p1,02:26:35.080,02:27:38.300,spk_2,	True	Counsel: She said, should the husband fail to obey the orders contained here, the wife may apply to the English court for leave under Part 3 of the English Matrimonial Family Proceedings Act 1984 to seek a pension sharing order in England, comporting with this court's orders. Although the above orders do not compel action by the trustees or managers of the respective pension schemes, the court has entered the orders with the expectation that if enforcement is necessary, the English court will in effect, enforce the orders of the interests of comity under Part 3 of the English Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, if husband is domiciled in England. So this is a good example of what we would say is the evolving nature of Part 3. You can actually have a foreign court recognising that it doesn't have the requisite powers to make the orders at once and therefore it relies on the English court to enforce its orders through invoking the powers under Part 3.
1	p1,00:02:06.220,00:06:04.260,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes. We saw the authors it listed in the report. The two circumstances that the Law Commissioners were addressing were these. Firstly, when a foreign court had made no financial order at all, and secondly, where the foreign court had made a financial order, but that order was inadequate. And this appeal is concerned only with the second category. It is a condition precedent to the exercise of powers under Part 3 that the wife has to show in the circumstances of her case that a serious injustice has arisen. The serious injustice that this wife relies upon is that after a marriage of 32 years, which produced five children of the family and where the assets were around £700,000, the Nigerian court in June of 2005 awarded her a lump sum of £21,000 and a life interest in the house on Tin Can Island in Lagos. This very modest award produced a very significant disparity, or discrepancy, in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife was left in a position in which she did not own any one of the four properties in the case, two of which were in Lagos and two of which were in London. She was only left with a life interest in the property, that it ceased to be her main home in 1999, six years before the Nigerian court had made its order. In 1999, when the marriage broke down, she came to London to live at 27 Litton Road in New Barnet, a property which the husband had owned from 1975, and which had thereafter been used as a base for the family during the marriage. The trial judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, found that these parties had a long standing and enduring connection with this jurisdiction, and on the basis that the wife forfeited her life interest in the Tin Can Island property, in her husband's favour, he made the following order under Part 3. He ordered the Litton Road be sold and that the wife receives 65% of the net proceeds of sale, which was intended on the valuation used in the proceedings to give her about £275,000, which was to be used as follows. £225,000 to buy herself a modest flat in North London, and £50,000 as a cash sum to supplement her income when she is unable to work. The wife is now aged 69. The Court of Appeal allowed the husband's appeal and dismissed the order for financial provision in Toto. As a consequence, the wife would be homeless in this country where she has been a citizen since 1972, and where she has made her home and worked as a carer for the last 10 years. The purpose of Part 3 was to remit hardship arising from the order of a foreign court. Yet, the Court of Appeal have provided an outcome which Lord Justice Ward, who gave the lead judgement candidly admitted, has left the wife in a parlous plight. In making my submissions my lords and my lady, I want to address 5 topics. The first will be the policy issues considered by the Law Commissioners, which are material to this appeal. Secondly, the statutory provisions of part 3.

1	p2,00:50:04.330,00:50:49.690,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The Nigerian court made an order for financial provision that produced very significant disparity in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife gave evidence to the Nigerian court that she said New Barnet is my home and that resulted in order for a life interest in a property that she had left six years earlier. The Nigerian court failed to provide adequate financial relief and caused this wife serious financial hardship at her age, at 69, what greater hardship can there be than to be homeless? We say that the court repeal lost sight of the underlying purpose of Part 3, which is to remit financial hardship arising from a foreign order. In construing the provisions of Section 16, they imposed a test by looking at the forum conveniens test that was not contemplated by the Law Commission and is far too restrictive a test that it would shut out virtually all applications when a foreign court has made a financial order.
1	p3,01:56:15.050,01:56:51.850,spk_4,	True	Counsel: If for example you had a situation where an Italian court made a financial order making an order for maintenance for a wife. But there was a property here that the Italian court had not dealt with. Then the wife would be able to apply here under Part 3 to deal with the, the property in this jurisdiction. And there would be no risk of conflicting judgments because Brussels One would not apply to her claim in England because it would be a claim dealing with rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship.
1	p1,02:08:51.750,02:11:33.280,spk_2,	True	Counsel: And then Section 26 of the Act sets out criteria from which the Court should have regard in considering the appropriateness of making a relief order including the connection which the [inaudible] have and so on. So it's a similar statute. And if you go on to page 521, Mr Justice Quirk deals with the similarity between the Irish statute and the English statute, because today there have apparently been no cases reported within this jurisdiction where consideration of section 23 of the Act of 1995 has been required. In England, the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 contains provisions similar to the provisions of section 23 and 26 of the act. And it says section 13 of the 1984 act is similar, but not quite identical to section 23. And section 16 of the 1984 act is similar but not identical to section 26. And then he goes on to say that some of the reported cases in England have been referred to in the course of the case. The facts of the case are not particularly relevant, they concerned an Irish couple, who, had gone to live in Spain, and the husband had issued proceedings in Spain, and he had come to a deal with the wife where he paid her £50,000 from a final satisfaction of her claim. And there were no Spanish financial proceedings and no Spanish order was actually made. They only had the agreement, and it would seem that the outcome provided by that arrangement was inadequate, and it looks as though the husband hadn't been full and frank about his financial circumstances, and if we could just pick up page 532, Mr Justice Quirk just deals with the outcome achieved in Spain, he says on the evidence, the outcome achieved by the court in Spain in October 1996 was unfair enough just to the applicants in the circumstance. Having regard to his means of financial circumstances at that time, the sum of £50,000 from which the applicant received, 46 was inadequate to discharge the respondents financial and other obligations to the applicant arising out of their marriage. And then, if you look over the page, please, at 533, you will see what he considered the statutory relief was aimed to provide.  have, and so on. So it's a similar statute.

1	p1,00:10:27.300,00:20:34.350,spk_2,	True	Counsel: They pose the specific question. Should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? The difficulties in the way of reform of the law are thus formidable. They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied for financial relief in the country where the divorce was granted, but either failed to do so or did so, but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate. Correspondingly, the difficulties are least acute in cases where the law of the country where the divorce was granted contained no provision for financially relief in favour of the wife. We think there is little doubt that a wife who is thus unable to obtain any financial relief, should, provided she can establish a sufficient link between the marriage and this country, be eligible to apply for a financial order here. But we have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court to hear applications for financial relief, notwithstanding the existence of a prior foreign decree of divorce, should be exercisable only in such cases and not in cases where the foreign court had made, or could have made a financial order. We are, however, in no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one with which the marriage has much real connection, but there are also subsidiary arguments which seemed to us to support the view that a restriction of this kind would be undesirable. First, injustice could occur if the foreign divorce court, having dealt with part of a wife's claim for financial relief, could not or would not make any order in relation to capital assets in England, and the English court were precluded from making any order because of the foreign court's order. And my lords and my lady, we say that that really strikes at the very heart of this appeal because in the Nigerian court, the position was that they could not make an order to transfer Litton Road to the wife, and nor would they make any order for her to have a settlement of that property either. And as you will see when we go on to look at the statute, the Law Commissioner's view that there should be no restriction was actually enshrined in the statute, specifically in section 13(2), where the statute says that you can make an application, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order for financial provision. The foundation of Part 3 was based on the Law Commissioner's view that a foreign court which had granted the divorce was not necessarily the only court to deal with all issues arising from the divorce, and they came to this decision for for two reasons. First, they recognise the increasing international mobility, which meant that a marriage and the spouses can have connections with more than one jurisdiction and one legal system. Where they married, where they are domiciles, where they are nationals, and where they have lived during the marriage, pre and post separation, and where their assets are located, give them a connection with more than one jurisdiction. And if I could ask you, please, to look at paragraph 27 which is the preceding paragraph to the one that I just referred to, and just starting from the second sentence, it reads. In a world of pure legal analysis, it would no doubt be possible to identify a single system of law with which the marriage was more closely connected than any other. That system could then be regarded as the proper law of the marriage. As such, it would govern the marriage and its consequences. We do not, however, think that this aim can in practise, be achieved at a time when people can travel easily from one country to another. Marriages are increasingly connected with several different systems of law, for example, with the law of the party's nationality or the law of their place of residence, the place where the marriage was celebrated, or even with the law of their religion. In our view, it is unrealistic to suppose that a process of juristic analysis will identify any single right system of law to which all questions relevant to a particular marriage should be referred to the exclusion of all other systems. In this particular case, although it is right to say that during the marriage the parties spent most of their married life in Nigeria, they have a longstanding and enduring connection with this country. This case is a very good example, we say, of the sort of category of case that the Law Commissioners were considering in paragraph 27. There is no right or obvious jurisdiction to resolve all matters that arise in this case, and it's interesting perhaps, to make the point that both parties had jurisdiction to issue a petition for divorce in Nigeria, and in England. That shows the the connection. It is difficult when you look at the background to the case, which I'll come to a bit in more detail in the moment, it's difficult to identify any aspect of the party's lives that did not have a connection with England, from the very beginning. They met here, married here, and the husband still owns two properties here. They are dual nationals, and perhaps the most striking feature of the case, from a financial point of view, is that 75% of the parties' wealth is not in Nigeria, but it's in England. The second reason for the Law Commission as rejecting the principle that only one court should decide all financial matters consequent on divorce, was that the commissioners recognised that an injustice could arise when the foreign court had made an order which was inadequate and produced a serious injustice. This inadequacy could arise in a number of different ways. First, the foreign court might not have extensive powers to make financial orders. It might be only able to make orders for maintenance, as opposed to orders for lump sum or, as we have in this country, property adjustment. Secondly, the foreign court might not have the power to make orders in respect of property, especially immovable property outside its territorial jurisdiction. This meant that a property in England would be outside the ambit, or could be outside the ambit of a foreign order. And also lastly, of significance in this particular case, is that foreign courts do not necessarily have the range of orders that courts can exercise in this country. The range of orders might be very limited, as was the position here where the Nigerian court, it is common ground, only has power to order a settlement of property and not an order for property adjustment, which transfers the ownership of property from one spouse to another. Also underlying the Act was the Law Commissioner's concern about the financial burden that could be thrust on the public purse, if the effect of the foreign order made inadequate provision, and that is referred to not only in the report but also in the working paper. If I could just ask you please to turn back in tab 1 to page 2, it's the second page of the Commissioner's report. They were dealing with a situation where no order had been made by the foreign court. I'm just reading four lines down from the top of page 2. Such a woman may thus face destitution, and her only source of financial support may be supplementary benefit, and if benefit is paid to her, the supplementary benefits authorities will have no legal right to recover the sums paid from the husband, since he will no longer be a 'liable' relative. The fact that the husband lives in this country and has substantial assets here makes no difference to the legal position. And that concern about being a drain on the public part is also a factor in this case because as a result of the Court of Appeal decision, the wife has been deprived of the means to provide a modest property for herself. And if she wants to remain living in London, where she has lived for the last 10 years, she will have to apply for local authority housing, and I will develop this point in due course.

1	p1,00:00:46.820,00:01:57.330,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Good morning, my lords and my lady, with my learned junior Miss Eleanor Harris. I appear on behalf of Mrs Agbaje, the appellate. My learned friend, Mr Timothy Scott QC and Mr Peter Mitchell appear on behalf of Mr Agbaje, the respondent to the appeal. If I may, I will have adopt the Family Law convention of calling the parties husband and wife. The principal issue arising on this appeal is in what circumstances is it appropriate for the English court to make a further financial order when a foreign court has already divorced the spouses and made a financial order? At first blush, it may seem unusual that courts in two different countries can at different times, make financial orders arising out of the same cause of action, namely the parties divorce. The power in English court to make a further financial order derives from Part 3 of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984. And it was intended by its framers, the law commissioners, to remit financial hardship arising from two distinct circumstances.
2	p2,00:18:17.240,00:21:40.950,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Mr. Justice Munby said, in the first place I do not think that Mr Mitchell has made good his assertion that the discretion exercised by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay under section 72 of the Nigerian matrimonial causes that was anything like as broad as that which would be exercisable by an English judge under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. On the contrary, the powerful arguments marshalled by Miss Harris strongly suggests to me that it is nothing like so wide and that, at least in relation to Capitol vision, the Nigerian jurisdiction is not fundamentally needs base at all. So it would seem that the wife was driven to litigate in Nigeria if she was to litigate there at all on a narrower and less favourable basis, than would have been the case if she had been litigating in this country. And Lord Justice Wilson at page 56 a few pages on in the Court of Appeal at the hearing of Mr Barges application for permission to appeal against Mr Justice Munby, was of the same view in the middle of paragraph 17 on page 56, he said. However, the analysis of Mr Justice Munby in relation to the way in which that claim was rejected in Nigeria may well prove to be relevant. It is strongly arguable that the claim was not dispatched by redistributive principles at all, whatever their precise nature, but rather by reference to principles, actual ownership to which we were in this jurisdiction were confined prior to the reforms introduced in 1971. Mr Scott submits that such a conclusion cannot be made even on a provisional basis without expert evidence as to the principles of Nigerian law which must have lain behind the Nigerian judge's rejection of the claim. With respect, I reject that submission. In my view, Mr Justice, Munby's recital of the way in which counsel's arguments in Nigeria were cast and the way in which the judge in Nigeria articulated her rejection of the wife's claim enables one provisionally to reach that conclusion. If such a conclusion is valid or arguably valid, then the comments made by Lord Justice Thorpe in Jordan, which the judge cited are in point. It may be that the failure of the wife to achieve transfer of that property in the Nigerian court was a result of the application of principles in no way comparable to those by reference to which we would dispatch such a claim. And in in his printed case, my learned friend has said that the English court made orders similar to the sort of order the Nigerian court made before the changes came in 1971 and that significant disparity between husband and wife in terms of their financial positions after an English ancillary relief order were not uncommon in the past, we submit that those arguments really are merely an exercise in in retrospection, arguing that the wife's award that she obtained in Nigeria would not be out of place in the 1960's is not a constructive way to approach this appeal. Family law, perhaps more than any other branch of the law, has to evolve to meet changing social mores and expectations. In the case of part three, we have the increasing mobility of people around the world over the last 25 years.

2	p1,00:37:35.830,00:40:21.830,spk_2,	True	Counsel: We can see how they expected the new regime to operate. Paragraph 51. Having rejected proposals for a rigid bar on applications, we are left with the alternative of a flexible discretion under which, although an application could be presented by any person able to satisfy the jurisdictional test that we have recommended, such applications would be the subject of preliminary scrutiny by the court, which would only allow the applicant to proceed if, in the circumstances, it was thought appropriate to do so. In the general formulation of the proposed discretion, we think that it should be made clear by express statutory provisions that the object of the discretion is to provide for the quote occasional hard case. We consider, therefore, that the court should be given power to entertain an application for a financial provision or property adjustment order, notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce, if in the light of all the circumstances of the case, and in the particular certain specified circumstances, the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise. Our present inclination is not to favour any requirement that the applicant must establish the facts of the case to be exceptional, since he may well belong to a religious or ethnic group in which it is not uncommon, for example, for a wife should be divorced abroad without having a right to claim financial relief. And if I could just ask you please to turn to page 109, paragraph 66, which is the concluding paragraph of the working paper, just to pick up the point about the condition precedent, the Law Commission has considered whether a Part 3 application could be made if another court in the British Isles have made in order. In other words, if a Scottish court had made an order, could you then come to England for a Part 3 order, and they decided no. And just reading the last paragraph, they said it would nevertheless, in our view, be inappropriate to allow those divorced elsewhere in the British Isles to apply to the courts in England and Wales for financial orders. There will be few, if any, cases in which a person divorced in another part of the British Isles will have suffered 'serious injustice', which we believe it should be necessary to establish as a condition, precedent in the exercise of the powers that we propose.

2	p1,00:53:46.050,00:55:27.840,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Holmes and Holmes was actually very undeserving case for a Part 3 application because you had English spouses who had been married in England but later moved to New York. The husband issued a petition in New York, and the New York court made comprehensive orders in respect of all their properties in New York, and in England, and for them to be sold and the proceeds divided, and also made an order for maintenance for the wife and the child. So the New York court, having made a proper distribution of the assets, it seemed surprising that the wife wanted to invoke the powers of Part 3, and what she wanted to do is to try and remain in the English property, which the American court had said should be sold and the proceeds divided. It was always, we say, a very weak application, not surprising that the Ex parte application was refused, and Lord Justice Purchas talks about the purpose of the Act. If I could ask you, just look at these above G on page 57. He said, for my part, I do not believe that the intention of Parliament in passing this Act was in any way to vest in the English courts, any part of review or even correction of orders made in a foreign forum by a competent court, in which the whole matter has been examined in a way exactly equivalent to the examination which would have taken place if the application had been made in the first instance in the courts here. And the words I rely upon is, in a way, exactly equivalent. And we say that the proceedings in Nigeria were not determined in a way that is another way be described as exactly equivalent to the examination that took here.
2	p1,02:13:07.020,02:16:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Dealing with my next section about how Part 3 should be applied, we've already dealt with the problem about the statutory language once he gate is opened and the way the Law Commissioners dealt with the case, and I'd like to make these submissions, that the discretionary powers of the court under Part 3 should be operated, we say, in a flexible way, focused on remitting the hardship and providing a bespoke solution. And that is because the circumstances that will arise in these cases, which involve other jurisdictions, will be so varied in each and every case. It's often said in domestic cases that no two cases are the same and cases are fact specific, and decided on specific facts, and of course that's correct. But in a Part 3 case where there has been a prior financial order, the range of circumstances that the court has to look at under section 16 are very considerable and will vary so much from case to case because you're obviously dealing with different nationalities and different countries. So that's why we say it should be flexible and focused on providing a bespoke solution. And if it's applied within that sort of framework where it's aiming to remit, the hardship that can be identified, then these majority of tags about being a second bite of the cherry really are not that, and if the English court makes an order supplementing the foreign order, in those sort of circumstances, then it would be wrong to characteristics that as being an appeal from the order of the foreign court because my learned friend is going to say we just had a second bite of the cherry. It was all canvassed in Nigeria, and that what Mr Justice Coleridge was doing was the acting as the Court of Appeal on the order made in Nigeria, but we say no, because the whole purpose is a flexible solution aimed at dealing with the injustice that can be seen. And we also submit that when the court considers whether or not it's appropriate to make an order, as part of all the circumstances of the case, it has to consider the impact on the state purse because as a result of a foreign order, a Part 3 applicant may be reduced to being being reliant upon state benefits or having to apply for local authority accommodation. And that is a very relevant factor in most Part 3 cases because the applicant in nine cases out of 10 is going to be here, in order to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements, and his or her target may very well be a property in this country that he or she wants to live in. And we say it is contrary to public policy to cast upon the public person obligation that should really be born within the family. If the means can be found to provide for the wife, then why should the public person have to pay? And that, we say, is a relevant argument when we come to consider comity.  the gate is opened and the way the Law Commissioners dealt with the case, and I'd like to make these submissions, that the discretionary powers of the court under Part 3 should be operated, we say, in a flexible way, focused on remitting the hardship and providing a bespoke solution. And that is because the circumstances that will arise in these cases, which involve other jurisdictions, will be so varied in each and every case. It's often said in domestic cases that no two cases are the same and cases are fact specific, and decided on specific facts, and of course that's correct. But in a Part 3 case where there has been a prior financial order, the range of circumstances that the court has to look at under section 16 are very considerable and will vary so much from case to case because you're obviously dealing with different nationalities and different countries. So that's why we say it should be flexible and focused on providing a bespoke solution. And if it's applied within that sort of framework where it's aiming to remit, the hardship that can be identified, then these majority of tags about being a second bite of the cherry really are not that, and if the English court makes an order supplementing the foreign order, in those sort of circumstances, then it would be wrong to characteristics that as being an appeal from the order of the foreign court because my learned friend is going to say we just had a second bite of the cherry. It was all canvassed in Nigeria, and that what Mr Justice Coleridge was doing was the acting as the Court of Appeal on the order made in Nigeria, but we say no, because the whole purpose is a flexible solution aimed at dealing with the injustice that can be seen.

That is the risk that litigants with little or no real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that to confer such a power on the courts could, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply, to the incidence of a particular marriage, pose problems which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to resolve. Where we don't need to be concerned about the applicable law in the case because English law is applied, and in Scotland, Scots Law is applied. In order to meet their concerns about forum shopping, the Law Commissioners proposed three specific safeguards. The first, where jurisdictional requirements based on those four divorce proceedings. They considered that the party should, or either of the party should be domiciled in England and Wales, at the time the application was made, or when the foreign divorce order was made or alternatively, either of the parties could be habitually resident in this jurisdiction for a period of 12 months, either before the application was made or the foreign divorce took effect. There is also another basis for jurisdiction, which doesn't apply in this case but I'll mention it anyway, because the wife could have come within this provision had she wanted to. And that provision is that if either of the parties had a beneficial interest in a property that had been a matrimonial home in this jurisdiction, if you invoke that limb of jurisdiction, then the claimant is restricted to the amount of the beneficial interest. In other words, you can't get more than the beneficial interest that's owned by the other spouse. The second safeguard, to guard against forum shopping, was a filter process in the form of an Ex parte application before a High Court judge, for leave to bring the Part 3 application. The purpose of that was obviously to filter out unmeritorious applications before the other spouse was involved in the proceedings. The third safeguard was consideration by the judge of what the Commissioner's described as some specific guidelines, which we will see in due course, because these guidelines became incorporated in section 16, which is the main statutory provisions that we're concerned with in this case. And those guidelines were to assist the court in the exercise of its discretion to determine whether it was appropriate for the English court to make an order, and these guidelines, as we shall see, focus on connection to this jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction in which the foreign divorce was made, and then on financial matters arising in the jurisdictions. There was no issue in this case at any stage about jurisdiction. The wife based her application on her habitual residents here. Of some significance we say, in this case, is the fact that the wife was acquitted of forum shopping. The very feature of the reforms that the Law Commissioners were concerned about. Mr Justice Munby, who dealt with the Ex parte application and then the inter-parties application brought by the husband to set aside the granted leave. On the papers before him, acquitted the wife of forum shopping. If I could ask you please to turn to the bound volume and appendix 1, what I'd like to refer you please to page 45, which is his judgement. It's page 45, paragraph 58, towards the bottom of the page. Little Roman two.
2	p3,00:05:23.740,00:06:30.080,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The next point, which I would wish to raise, is to go back to My Lady's question as to whether there was any authority in relation to the cases where no order has been made in the foreign court. And I said yesterday that so far as I was aware, and I think I speak for all of us on the council's bench, none of us have been able to find any such cases. And I'm not aware of any such cases myself, and I've been wondering why that should be. It's somewhat speculative, but it did occur to me that in the cases where the wife has not been able to pursue any financial claims in the divorce jurisdiction, it is also quite likely that she would encounter enforcement problems in relation to any award which might be made under Part Three, and therefore that her claim under Part Three might, for instance, be tailored and restricted to assets which are to be found in the United Kingdom or another, more accessible jurisdictions. And that, therefore, that such cases would be less likely to give rise to the sort of full blown contest, which would in turn be likely to find its way into the law reports.
2	p1,00:10:27.300,00:20:34.350,spk_2,	True	Counsel: They pose the specific question. Should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? The difficulties in the way of reform of the law are thus formidable. They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied for financial relief in the country where the divorce was granted, but either failed to do so or did so, but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate. Correspondingly, the difficulties are least acute in cases where the law of the country where the divorce was granted contained no provision for financially relief in favour of the wife. We think there is little doubt that a wife who is thus unable to obtain any financial relief, should, provided she can establish a sufficient link between the marriage and this country, be eligible to apply for a financial order here. But we have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court to hear applications for financial relief, notwithstanding the existence of a prior foreign decree of divorce, should be exercisable only in such cases and not in cases where the foreign court had made, or could have made a financial order. We are, however, in no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one with which the marriage has much real connection, but there are also subsidiary arguments which seemed to us to support the view that a restriction of this kind would be undesirable. First, injustice could occur if the foreign divorce court, having dealt with part of a wife's claim for financial relief, could not or would not make any order in relation to capital assets in England, and the English court were precluded from making any order because of the foreign court's order. And my lords and my lady, we say that that really strikes at the very heart of this appeal because in the Nigerian court, the position was that they could not make an order to transfer Litton Road to the wife, and nor would they make any order for her to have a settlement of that property either. And as you will see when we go on to look at the statute, the Law Commissioner's view that there should be no restriction was actually enshrined in the statute, specifically in section 13(2), where the statute says that you can make an application, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order for financial provision. The foundation of Part 3 was based on the Law Commissioner's view that a foreign court which had granted the divorce was not necessarily the only court to deal with all issues arising from the divorce, and they came to this decision for for two reasons. First, they recognise the increasing international mobility, which meant that a marriage and the spouses can have connections with more than one jurisdiction and one legal system. Where they married, where they are domiciles, where they are nationals, and where they have lived during the marriage, pre and post separation, and where their assets are located, give them a connection with more than one jurisdiction. And if I could ask you, please, to look at paragraph 27 which is the preceding paragraph to the one that I just referred to, and just starting from the second sentence, it reads. In a world of pure legal analysis, it would no doubt be possible to identify a single system of law with which the marriage was more closely connected than any other. That system could then be regarded as the proper law of the marriage. As such, it would govern the marriage and its consequences. We do not, however, think that this aim can in practise, be achieved at a time when people can travel easily from one country to another. Marriages are increasingly connected with several different systems of law, for example, with the law of the party's nationality or the law of their place of residence, the place where the marriage was celebrated, or even with the law of their religion. In our view, it is unrealistic to suppose that a process of juristic analysis will identify any single right system of law to which all questions relevant to a particular marriage should be referred to the exclusion of all other systems. In this particular case, although it is right to say that during the marriage the parties spent most of their married life in Nigeria, they have a longstanding and enduring connection with this country. This case is a very good example, we say, of the sort of category of case that the Law Commissioners were considering in paragraph 27. There is no right or obvious jurisdiction to resolve all matters that arise in this case, and it's interesting perhaps, to make the point that both parties had jurisdiction to issue a petition for divorce in Nigeria, and in England. That shows the the connection. It is difficult when you look at the background to the case, which I'll come to a bit in more detail in the moment, it's difficult to identify any aspect of the party's lives that did not have a connection with England, from the very beginning. They met here, married here, and the husband still owns two properties here. They are dual nationals, and perhaps the most striking feature of the case, from a financial point of view, is that 75% of the parties' wealth is not in Nigeria, but it's in England. The second reason for the Law Commission as rejecting the principle that only one court should decide all financial matters consequent on divorce, was that the commissioners recognised that an injustice could arise when the foreign court had made an order which was inadequate and produced a serious injustice. This inadequacy could arise in a number of different ways. First, the foreign court might not have extensive powers to make financial orders. It might be only able to make orders for maintenance, as opposed to orders for lump sum or, as we have in this country, property adjustment. Secondly, the foreign court might not have the power to make orders in respect of property, especially immovable property outside its territorial jurisdiction. This meant that a property in England would be outside the ambit, or could be outside the ambit of a foreign order. And also lastly, of significance in this particular case, is that foreign courts do not necessarily have the range of orders that courts can exercise in this country. The range of orders might be very limited, as was the position here where the Nigerian court, it is common ground, only has power to order a settlement of property and not an order for property adjustment, which transfers the ownership of property from one spouse to another. Also underlying the Act was the Law Commissioner's concern about the financial burden that could be thrust on the public purse, if the effect of the foreign order made inadequate provision, and that is referred to not only in the report but also in the working paper. If I could just ask you please to turn back in tab 1 to page 2, it's the second page of the Commissioner's report. They were dealing with a situation where no order had been made by the foreign court. I'm just reading four lines down from the top of page 2. Such a woman may thus face destitution, and her only source of financial support may be supplementary benefit, and if benefit is paid to her, the supplementary benefits authorities will have no legal right to recover the sums paid from the husband, since he will no longer be a 'liable' relative. The fact that the husband lives in this country and has substantial assets here makes no difference to the legal position. And that concern about being a drain on the public part is also a factor in this case because as a result of the Court of Appeal decision, the wife has been deprived of the means to provide a modest property for herself. And if she wants to remain living in London, where she has lived for the last 10 years, she will have to apply for local authority housing, and I will develop this point in due course.

2	p1,00:02:06.220,00:06:04.260,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes. We saw the authors it listed in the report. The two circumstances that the Law Commissioners were addressing were these. Firstly, when a foreign court had made no financial order at all, and secondly, where the foreign court had made a financial order, but that order was inadequate. And this appeal is concerned only with the second category. It is a condition precedent to the exercise of powers under Part 3 that the wife has to show in the circumstances of her case that a serious injustice has arisen. The serious injustice that this wife relies upon is that after a marriage of 32 years, which produced five children of the family and where the assets were around £700,000, the Nigerian court in June of 2005 awarded her a lump sum of £21,000 and a life interest in the house on Tin Can Island in Lagos. This very modest award produced a very significant disparity, or discrepancy, in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife was left in a position in which she did not own any one of the four properties in the case, two of which were in Lagos and two of which were in London. She was only left with a life interest in the property, that it ceased to be her main home in 1999, six years before the Nigerian court had made its order. In 1999, when the marriage broke down, she came to London to live at 27 Litton Road in New Barnet, a property which the husband had owned from 1975, and which had thereafter been used as a base for the family during the marriage. The trial judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, found that these parties had a long standing and enduring connection with this jurisdiction, and on the basis that the wife forfeited her life interest in the Tin Can Island property, in her husband's favour, he made the following order under Part 3. He ordered the Litton Road be sold and that the wife receives 65% of the net proceeds of sale, which was intended on the valuation used in the proceedings to give her about £275,000, which was to be used as follows. £225,000 to buy herself a modest flat in North London, and £50,000 as a cash sum to supplement her income when she is unable to work. The wife is now aged 69. The Court of Appeal allowed the husband's appeal and dismissed the order for financial provision in Toto. As a consequence, the wife would be homeless in this country where she has been a citizen since 1972, and where she has made her home and worked as a carer for the last 10 years. The purpose of Part 3 was to remit hardship arising from the order of a foreign court. Yet, the Court of Appeal have provided an outcome which Lord Justice Ward, who gave the lead judgement candidly admitted, has left the wife in a parlous plight. In making my submissions my lords and my lady, I want to address 5 topics. The first will be the policy issues considered by the Law Commissioners, which are material to this appeal. Secondly, the statutory provisions of part 3.

2	p1,00:44:19.790,00:46:30.340,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Section 13 is the filter process. It's the applicant having to apply to the High Court judge for leave to begin an application for financial relief, and in sub-paragraph one will see it reads. No application for an order for financial relief shall be made under this part of this Act, unless the leave of the court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court, and the court shall not grant leave unless it considers that there is a substantial ground for the making of an application for such an order. The subsections that follow are of some importance in this case. Subsection 2 is the one I mentioned earlier, which is statutory recognition for the fact that the court may make a Part 3 order, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order that provided for a payment or transfer of property to the applicant or a child of the family. That permits the dual application, and subsection 3 is also important, as will be developed in due course. Leave under this under this section may be granted subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit. This appeal does not really concern the Ex parte stage because, as your lordships and my lady will know, the husband appealed. Mr Justice Munby's decision not to set aside the Ex parte granted leave, and it was referred to Lord Justice Thorpe on paper who refused the application, and then there was an oral hearing in which my learned friend appeared before Lord Justice Warren Wilson, who dismissed the application and gave judgments. I don't want to spend too much time on this, although I would like to just briefly refer you to the leading case of Holmes because it is relevant to some extent, to our appeal.
2	p1,01:16:33.230,01:17:00.630,spk_2,	True	Counsel: We say, my lord, that although forum non conveniens issues were obviously engaged in these cases because they inevitably will be because we're dealing with two jurisdictions, that they were not proposing in section 16, a strict forum non conveniens test, really because of the language. Well, the language is it is not proposing a test for the Court to decide with which jurisdiction the marriage has the closest connection.

2	p3,00:42:45.150,00:44:34.950,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And at paragraph 19 at page 429 Mr Justice Coleridge states the all events on 29 -- 23rd, October 1973, the Johannesburg Divorce Court dissolved the marriage made in order that the defendant forfeit the benefits of community of marriage and that the plaintiff pay maintenance for the said children at £130 a month. That is the only order that has ever been made governing the financial position between the parties prior to the institution of these proceedings. And so the position was that the wife's claims had never been tested. No order had ever been made in favour of the wife in South Africa, so this is perhaps the closest which we come to the court's approach in circumstances where no foreign order has been made because the only order related to the community of property regime and a specific order for the children and in those circumstances, again not surprisingly, Mr Justice Coleridge felt it appropriate to make an order and one sees at paragraph 39 that his approach whilst at this stage, by operation of section 17 and 18, the application becomes in all but name a conventional ancillary relief application set against this very unusual factual background. So in that context, even though it is right for the court to consider the application, is it right to make any order? And if so what? I have to consider all the factors under section 25. And he then proceeds to do so, um, and makes his order and sets out a schedule of the husband's significant assets.
2	p1,00:55:35.760,01:04:31.320,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes he is, I agree. If we could please, then turn to page 59. This is the short judgement of Lord Justice Russell, which is often quoted in these cases and indeed was quoted in this case by Mr Justice Munby, reading from the second sentence, the test in section 31 is in my judgement, plainly, a more stringent one, that's referring to judicial review. Prima facie, the order of the foreign court should prevail, save in exceptional circumstances, and a good case for any interference with it or adjustment of it or any supplementation of it should be apparent before any leave is granted under section 13, where the foreign court is properly seizing the dispute, as it was in this case. So far as it is possible, duplicity of proceedings should be avoided in this, as in all other fields and in the interests of the parties and their children, as well as in the interests of justice and the comity of nations. So he sees it as a strict test, a hard test, where there has been a foreign order. He's talking about exceptional circumstances, although the statute doesn't refer to that, and the and the Law Commission has actually said they did not want it to cover an exceptional case. But what is significant in my submission is the use of the word supplementation. Because what really happened here was that there was supplementation of the Nigerian order. And could we please look at Mr Justice Munby's judgement, again, it's in the bound volume. At appendix 1, page 47. It is paragraphs 59 and 60. This is how he dealt with the substantial ground test. At the end of the day, the real issue seems to me to be the same as it was when this case was first before me. To paraphrase what I said in my earlier judgement, is this in truth, simply a case where a wife is seeking to have a second bite of the cherry following proceedings in a foreign country which, although not satisfactory from her point of view and although not as generous from her point of view as comparable proceedings, would be in this country were nevertheless appropriately conducted and which led to a financial order in her favour, which can be and has been implemented? Or is it, on the other hand, a case where the circumstances are sufficiently exceptional, using the word in the sense in which it was used by Lord Justice Russell, that notwithstanding the making of a significant order in her favour by the foreign court, it is nonetheless proper to enable her to pursue a second application in this country. In my judgement, this case falls into the latter category. What is in my judgement, the very considerable discrepancy, indeed, between the aggregate value of what this court would consider to be the relevant matrimonial assets, some of the most valuable being located in this country, and the very modest amount of the provisions made for this wife following a marriage of, I emphasise 32 years, justifies the conclusion that there is within the meaning of section 31 of the Act, substantial ground for her making the application. If I deny her relief, she will suffer hardship, in my judgement, very serious hardship indeed, being faced in all probability with the unenviable choice of either remaining homeless in this country, where she is now based and where she wants to stay, or returning to Nigeria. And the test that he applied there was approved by the Court of Appeal when the husband's application for leave to appeal was dismissed. Part 3 proceedings have attracted the pejorative tag of being a second bite of the cherry, and that description implies that a Part 3 application is a complete rerun of the same proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction, and that what happens is that all the issues are canvassed again before a different judge in a different country with a different adjudication sort. But, my lord, we say that that is not the purpose of Part 3, and that is certainly not how it was envisaged it would be utilised by the Commissioners. We say that a Part 3 application should be case managed and directed to achieve the purpose of remitting the hardship that has been identified arising from the foreign financial order. And this is something that Mr Justice Munby addressed and dealt with, and he imposed, as he could do, as you remember under section 13(3), stringent conditions as to how the case was to be run at the final hearing. And if we could read on, please, to paragraph 61 of his judgement, I think you still have the page open, he says, so in principle, and despite everything said by Mr Mitchell, I accept that the wife should have leave to make her claim. In saying this, I have, of course, had regard to each and every one of the various factors referred to in section 16(2) of the Act, but this is subject to one very important qualification. There is, as it seems to me, very considerable force indeed, in Mr Mitchell's submission that the husband should not be exposed to the kind of extensive and no doubt expensive proceedings which the wife apparently has in mind. In my judgement, this is a case where it can be can now be seen, even if it was less obvious when the matter was first before me, that I should attach conditions, stringent conditions, to my grant of leave. I'm not prepared to contemplate a rerun of the Nigerian proceedings. I am not prepared to contemplate the reopening of factual issues which have been the subject of decision by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay. I am not prepared to contemplate a process involving extensive further evidence, questionnaires and disclosure, nor do I think there is any need for further evaluation or other evidence in relation to the conditional value of the various Nigerian properties. The court already has enough information on these topics to enable it to do proper justice in a fair and proportionate manner, not least bearing in mind that I propose also to impose a condition limiting the wife's property claims to the Barnett property, that's 27 Litton Road. By this, I mean a condition preventing the wife making any claim, whether a proprietary claim, or a claim for property adjustment, or a claim for any other form of transfer, or vesting of property order, to or in relation to any real property, whether in this country or in Nigeria. Saving except only for a claim for property adjustment border in relation to the Barnett property. This will not, however, prevent the wife pursuing her claims for a lump sum order and a payments order. I propose, therefore, to make an order dispensing with many of the normal steps in an ancillary relief, including directions designed to ensure that the wife substantive claim can come on for hearing as quickly, and as cheaply as possible. I am quite sure that full justice can be done to both parties at a hearing lasting no more than one day, and in which there is little if any oral evidence. And he also proposed in the final paragraph, as you can see for an appropriate order to be drawn up by counsel, and if necessary for there to be an informal financial dispute resolution hearing before him, to see whether the matter could be settled. And just in terms of that, within a fortnight of his judgement being handed down, the wife made an open offer on the fourth of January of 2007 to accept a transfer of Litton Road, on the basis of no order as to costs, and a clean break. And on the 31st of January of 2007, the husband rejected that proposal, making no counterproposal in reply, and he appealed to the Court of Appeal. So that is why the case took longer to be resolved than Mr Justice Munby had envisaged.

3	p2,01:42:56.900,01:44:39.320,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Paragraph 2294. It is thus our view that in some circumstances the court in England should have power to make a financial order in favour of a former spouse whose marriage has been terminated by foreign decree. However, we found considerable difficulty in defining it precisely what circumstances such a power should be exercisable. In our view, the advantage of giving a remedy needs to be very carefully balanced, and not only against the risks of forum shopping. That is a risk that litigants with little on a real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that confer such a power on the courts. Would, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply to the incidence of a particular marriage, those problems which which will be difficult, if not impossible, to solve Could I just say there that the definition which is put forward their for forum shopping is, we would say only one aspect of the possible categories of forum shopping. And that's another aspect of foreign shopping is we say what happened in this case where somebody tries to ride two horses and and then at the bottom of paragraph 20 for the bottom of the page. After dealing with the hypothetical rural Taney. In example, problems could arise even if the wife were able to make a claim of financial relief and in fact did so but either failed to obtain any order or obtained an order which he thought to be inadequate. Should she be able to apply to the English court?
3	p2,01:51:49.360,01:53:46.570,spk_0,	True	Counsel: This in our submission is very important paragraph mm. In considering restrictions on the availability of the powers which we have proposed so to confine relief to those cases with which it is appropriate for the English court to deal, it is important to take a view on the mischief at which the proposed legislation is aimed. In our view, the proposals should be concerned primarily to give a remedy in those exceptional cases where a spouse, usually the wife, has been deprived of financial relief in circumstances where an English court might be driven to hold that it would be unjust to recognise the foreign decree, it follows that we consider the mischief at which the legislation should be aimed to be a narrow one. We do not think in the absence of any international consensus on the principles which would govern financial provision, that the English court should be unnecessarily exposed to the problems to which we have referred above, and we can see from the footnote that those are the paragraphs that we were looking at a moment ago. So in the Law Commission defines the mischief in exceedingly narrow terms but which make perfect sense when one remembers that the genesis of the Law Commission report was the case of Quazi v Quazi. Where the first instance judgment has, I think, taken 14 days. The court taken seven days the House of Lords two days to decide on the non recognition or recognition of a foreign decree when the real issue was whether the wife should be entitled to a share of a semi detached property in Wimbledon. And so the scene against that context, that background then this very narrow mischief makes a lot of sense. And plainly when the where the foreign court has been able to and indeed, in this case has made. Then the category of cases where the English talk to apply the ostensibly wide powers conferred under Section 16 should be treated very narrowly.

But again, there are wide observations, and if we can turn to the judgment of Lord Justice Thorpe at 219, letter F, Of course, the paradigm case creating the need for the legislation was the case where the decree of the Foreign Court was entitled to recognition in this jurisdiction, but where that court did not offer any rights to financial provision either at all or alternatively on any basis comparable to the rights arising under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in this jurisdiction. The opening sentences of the Law Commission report so state.
3	p3,00:05:23.740,00:06:30.080,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The next point, which I would wish to raise, is to go back to My Lady's question as to whether there was any authority in relation to the cases where no order has been made in the foreign court. And I said yesterday that so far as I was aware, and I think I speak for all of us on the council's bench, none of us have been able to find any such cases. And I'm not aware of any such cases myself, and I've been wondering why that should be. It's somewhat speculative, but it did occur to me that in the cases where the wife has not been able to pursue any financial claims in the divorce jurisdiction, it is also quite likely that she would encounter enforcement problems in relation to any award which might be made under Part Three, and therefore that her claim under Part Three might, for instance, be tailored and restricted to assets which are to be found in the United Kingdom or another, more accessible jurisdictions. And that, therefore, that such cases would be less likely to give rise to the sort of full blown contest, which would in turn be likely to find its way into the law reports.

3	p1,00:02:06.220,00:06:04.260,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes. We saw the authors it listed in the report. The two circumstances that the Law Commissioners were addressing were these. Firstly, when a foreign court had made no financial order at all, and secondly, where the foreign court had made a financial order, but that order was inadequate. And this appeal is concerned only with the second category. It is a condition precedent to the exercise of powers under Part 3 that the wife has to show in the circumstances of her case that a serious injustice has arisen. The serious injustice that this wife relies upon is that after a marriage of 32 years, which produced five children of the family and where the assets were around £700,000, the Nigerian court in June of 2005 awarded her a lump sum of £21,000 and a life interest in the house on Tin Can Island in Lagos. This very modest award produced a very significant disparity, or discrepancy, in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife was left in a position in which she did not own any one of the four properties in the case, two of which were in Lagos and two of which were in London. She was only left with a life interest in the property, that it ceased to be her main home in 1999, six years before the Nigerian court had made its order. In 1999, when the marriage broke down, she came to London to live at 27 Litton Road in New Barnet, a property which the husband had owned from 1975, and which had thereafter been used as a base for the family during the marriage. The trial judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, found that these parties had a long standing and enduring connection with this jurisdiction, and on the basis that the wife forfeited her life interest in the Tin Can Island property, in her husband's favour, he made the following order under Part 3. He ordered the Litton Road be sold and that the wife receives 65% of the net proceeds of sale, which was intended on the valuation used in the proceedings to give her about £275,000, which was to be used as follows. £225,000 to buy herself a modest flat in North London, and £50,000 as a cash sum to supplement her income when she is unable to work. The wife is now aged 69. The Court of Appeal allowed the husband's appeal and dismissed the order for financial provision in Toto. As a consequence, the wife would be homeless in this country where she has been a citizen since 1972, and where she has made her home and worked as a carer for the last 10 years. The purpose of Part 3 was to remit hardship arising from the order of a foreign court. Yet, the Court of Appeal have provided an outcome which Lord Justice Ward, who gave the lead judgement candidly admitted, has left the wife in a parlous plight. In making my submissions my lords and my lady, I want to address 5 topics. The first will be the policy issues considered by the Law Commissioners, which are material to this appeal. Secondly, the statutory provisions of part 3.
3	p1,00:00:46.820,00:01:57.330,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Good morning, my lords and my lady, with my learned junior Miss Eleanor Harris. I appear on behalf of Mrs Agbaje, the appellate. My learned friend, Mr Timothy Scott QC and Mr Peter Mitchell appear on behalf of Mr Agbaje, the respondent to the appeal. If I may, I will have adopt the Family Law convention of calling the parties husband and wife. The principal issue arising on this appeal is in what circumstances is it appropriate for the English court to make a further financial order when a foreign court has already divorced the spouses and made a financial order? At first blush, it may seem unusual that courts in two different countries can at different times, make financial orders arising out of the same cause of action, namely the parties divorce. The power in English court to make a further financial order derives from Part 3 of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984. And it was intended by its framers, the law commissioners, to remit financial hardship arising from two distinct circumstances.
3	p3,00:27:25.740,00:28:16.110,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Mr. Holman submitted to us that the mischief that the act of 1984 was designed to address did not include the case for foreign court of competent jurisdiction making an order which was neither appealed, nor impugned, where the order was final and designed to create a clean break and where the other spouse had fully complied with the order. Then a few lines down, It is clear from the working paper that the remedy to be provided was to be in those exceptional cases where spouses, usually a wife, had been deprived of financial relief in circumstances where an English court might be driven to hold that it would be unjust to recognise the limiting effect of the foreign decree. The Law Commission considered the mischief at which the legislation should be directed to be a narrow one and did not think it would be appropriate to encourage applications to the Courts of this country, inviting them to act in effect as a Court of Appeal from the courts of another country.

3	p1,00:37:35.830,00:40:21.830,spk_2,	True	Counsel: We can see how they expected the new regime to operate. Paragraph 51. Having rejected proposals for a rigid bar on applications, we are left with the alternative of a flexible discretion under which, although an application could be presented by any person able to satisfy the jurisdictional test that we have recommended, such applications would be the subject of preliminary scrutiny by the court, which would only allow the applicant to proceed if, in the circumstances, it was thought appropriate to do so. In the general formulation of the proposed discretion, we think that it should be made clear by express statutory provisions that the object of the discretion is to provide for the quote occasional hard case. We consider, therefore, that the court should be given power to entertain an application for a financial provision or property adjustment order, notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce, if in the light of all the circumstances of the case, and in the particular certain specified circumstances, the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise. Our present inclination is not to favour any requirement that the applicant must establish the facts of the case to be exceptional, since he may well belong to a religious or ethnic group in which it is not uncommon, for example, for a wife should be divorced abroad without having a right to claim financial relief. And if I could just ask you please to turn to page 109, paragraph 66, which is the concluding paragraph of the working paper, just to pick up the point about the condition precedent, the Law Commission has considered whether a Part 3 application could be made if another court in the British Isles have made in order. In other words, if a Scottish court had made an order, could you then come to England for a Part 3 order, and they decided no. And just reading the last paragraph, they said it would nevertheless, in our view, be inappropriate to allow those divorced elsewhere in the British Isles to apply to the courts in England and Wales for financial orders. There will be few, if any, cases in which a person divorced in another part of the British Isles will have suffered 'serious injustice', which we believe it should be necessary to establish as a condition, precedent in the exercise of the powers that we propose.

But that is my impression. One thing which I would just point out, I'm not going to try to take the court through it -- but at least a curiosity -- if one looks at page four of the report under the heading, The Need for Reform, paragraph two point six it says, the main criticism of the present law is that it leads to unjustifiably high results in certain cases.

3	p1,00:08:48.540,00:10:26.380,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Okay, if I could just refer you please to the very first paragraph, just to set the background as to why the Law Commissioners were involved, and they succinctly state in paragraph 1.1, where a marriage is terminated by foreign proceedings in which no financial order is made, a court in this country has no power to grant financial relief. In recent years, there has been a steady stream of cases coming before the courts, which has both highlighted the gap in the law and illustrated the hardship to which it may give rise. The view is that the law is in need of reform has been widely expressed. The obvious case, or what was known as the paradigm case for reform, was where the foreign jurisdiction had made no order at all in favour of invariably the wife applicant. But there were other cases which caused the Law Commission some concern because there were cases where a spouse had either not made an application for financial relief in the foreign court, even though she could have done so. Or, as in this case, she had made an application to the foreign court and obtained an order which she perceived as being inadequate. And this was a matter that the Law commissioners considered. And if I could ask you please to turn to page 91 in the working paper, paragraph 27, they pose the specific question, should there be a bar in cases when the foreign court has or could have made an order?
3	p1,00:10:27.300,00:20:34.350,spk_2,	True	Counsel: They pose the specific question. Should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? The difficulties in the way of reform of the law are thus formidable. They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied for financial relief in the country where the divorce was granted, but either failed to do so or did so, but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate. Correspondingly, the difficulties are least acute in cases where the law of the country where the divorce was granted contained no provision for financially relief in favour of the wife. We think there is little doubt that a wife who is thus unable to obtain any financial relief, should, provided she can establish a sufficient link between the marriage and this country, be eligible to apply for a financial order here. But we have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court to hear applications for financial relief, notwithstanding the existence of a prior foreign decree of divorce, should be exercisable only in such cases and not in cases where the foreign court had made, or could have made a financial order. We are, however, in no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one with which the marriage has much real connection, but there are also subsidiary arguments which seemed to us to support the view that a restriction of this kind would be undesirable. First, injustice could occur if the foreign divorce court, having dealt with part of a wife's claim for financial relief, could not or would not make any order in relation to capital assets in England, and the English court were precluded from making any order because of the foreign court's order. And my lords and my lady, we say that that really strikes at the very heart of this appeal because in the Nigerian court, the position was that they could not make an order to transfer Litton Road to the wife, and nor would they make any order for her to have a settlement of that property either. And as you will see when we go on to look at the statute, the Law Commissioner's view that there should be no restriction was actually enshrined in the statute, specifically in section 13(2), where the statute says that you can make an application, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order for financial provision. The foundation of Part 3 was based on the Law Commissioner's view that a foreign court which had granted the divorce was not necessarily the only court to deal with all issues arising from the divorce, and they came to this decision for for two reasons. First, they recognise the increasing international mobility, which meant that a marriage and the spouses can have connections with more than one jurisdiction and one legal system. Where they married, where they are domiciles, where they are nationals, and where they have lived during the marriage, pre and post separation, and where their assets are located, give them a connection with more than one jurisdiction. And if I could ask you, please, to look at paragraph 27 which is the preceding paragraph to the one that I just referred to, and just starting from the second sentence, it reads. In a world of pure legal analysis, it would no doubt be possible to identify a single system of law with which the marriage was more closely connected than any other. That system could then be regarded as the proper law of the marriage. As such, it would govern the marriage and its consequences. We do not, however, think that this aim can in practise, be achieved at a time when people can travel easily from one country to another. Marriages are increasingly connected with several different systems of law, for example, with the law of the party's nationality or the law of their place of residence, the place where the marriage was celebrated, or even with the law of their religion. In our view, it is unrealistic to suppose that a process of juristic analysis will identify any single right system of law to which all questions relevant to a particular marriage should be referred to the exclusion of all other systems. In this particular case, although it is right to say that during the marriage the parties spent most of their married life in Nigeria, they have a longstanding and enduring connection with this country. This case is a very good example, we say, of the sort of category of case that the Law Commissioners were considering in paragraph 27. There is no right or obvious jurisdiction to resolve all matters that arise in this case, and it's interesting perhaps, to make the point that both parties had jurisdiction to issue a petition for divorce in Nigeria, and in England. That shows the the connection. It is difficult when you look at the background to the case, which I'll come to a bit in more detail in the moment, it's difficult to identify any aspect of the party's lives that did not have a connection with England, from the very beginning. They met here, married here, and the husband still owns two properties here. They are dual nationals, and perhaps the most striking feature of the case, from a financial point of view, is that 75% of the parties' wealth is not in Nigeria, but it's in England. The second reason for the Law Commission as rejecting the principle that only one court should decide all financial matters consequent on divorce, was that the commissioners recognised that an injustice could arise when the foreign court had made an order which was inadequate and produced a serious injustice. This inadequacy could arise in a number of different ways. First, the foreign court might not have extensive powers to make financial orders. It might be only able to make orders for maintenance, as opposed to orders for lump sum or, as we have in this country, property adjustment. Secondly, the foreign court might not have the power to make orders in respect of property, especially immovable property outside its territorial jurisdiction. This meant that a property in England would be outside the ambit, or could be outside the ambit of a foreign order. And also lastly, of significance in this particular case, is that foreign courts do not necessarily have the range of orders that courts can exercise in this country. The range of orders might be very limited, as was the position here where the Nigerian court, it is common ground, only has power to order a settlement of property and not an order for property adjustment, which transfers the ownership of property from one spouse to another. Also underlying the Act was the Law Commissioner's concern about the financial burden that could be thrust on the public purse, if the effect of the foreign order made inadequate provision, and that is referred to not only in the report but also in the working paper. If I could just ask you please to turn back in tab 1 to page 2, it's the second page of the Commissioner's report. They were dealing with a situation where no order had been made by the foreign court. I'm just reading four lines down from the top of page 2. Such a woman may thus face destitution, and her only source of financial support may be supplementary benefit, and if benefit is paid to her, the supplementary benefits authorities will have no legal right to recover the sums paid from the husband, since he will no longer be a 'liable' relative. The fact that the husband lives in this country and has substantial assets here makes no difference to the legal position. And that concern about being a drain on the public part is also a factor in this case because as a result of the Court of Appeal decision, the wife has been deprived of the means to provide a modest property for herself. And if she wants to remain living in London, where she has lived for the last 10 years, she will have to apply for local authority housing, and I will develop this point in due course.
3	p1,01:29:44.470,01:30:31.370,spk_2,	True	Counsel: You can see the test that is applied in Scotland. Section 28 deals with circumstances in which a Scottish court may entertain an application for financial provision, and it says where parties to a marriage have been divorced in an overseas country, then subject to subsection 4, below, if the jurisdictional requirements and the conditions set out in subsections 2 and 3, below respectively, are satisfied, the court may entertain by one of the parties for an order for financial provision. And then the jurisdictional requirements are more onerous in Scotland because the applicant has to show not only domicile or habitual residence, but also, as you can see under b, that the other party was domicile or habitually resident at the appropriate time or owned a property in Scotland.

So it's a similar statute. And if you go on to page 521, Mr Justice Quirk deals with the similarity between the Irish statute and the English statute, because today there have apparently been no cases reported within this jurisdiction where consideration of section 23 of the Act of 1995 has been required. In England, the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 contains provisions similar to the provisions of section 23 and 26 of the act. And it says section 13 of the 1984 act is similar, but not quite identical to section 23. And section 16 of the 1984 act is similar but not identical to section 26. And then he goes on to say that some of the reported cases in England have been referred to in the course of the case. The facts of the case are not particularly relevant, they concerned an Irish couple, who, had gone to live in Spain, and the husband had issued proceedings in Spain, and he had come to a deal with the wife where he paid her £50,000 from a final satisfaction of her claim. And there were no Spanish financial proceedings and no Spanish order was actually made. They only had the agreement, and it would seem that the outcome provided by that arrangement was inadequate, and it looks as though the husband hadn't been full and frank about his financial circumstances, and if we could just pick up page 532, Mr Justice Quirk just deals with the outcome achieved in Spain, he says on the evidence, the outcome achieved by the court in Spain in October 1996 was unfair enough just to the applicants in the circumstance. Having regard to his means of financial circumstances at that time, the sum of £50,000 from which the applicant received, 46 was inadequate to discharge the respondents financial and other obligations to the applicant arising out of their marriage. And then, if you look over the page, please, at 533, you will see what he considered the statutory relief was aimed to provide.

That is the risk that litigants with little or no real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that to confer such a power on the courts could, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply, to the incidence of a particular marriage, pose problems which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to resolve. Where we don't need to be concerned about the applicable law in the case because English law is applied, and in Scotland, Scots Law is applied. In order to meet their concerns about forum shopping, the Law Commissioners proposed three specific safeguards. The first, where jurisdictional requirements based on those four divorce proceedings. They considered that the party should, or either of the party should be domiciled in England and Wales, at the time the application was made, or when the foreign divorce order was made or alternatively, either of the parties could be habitually resident in this jurisdiction for a period of 12 months, either before the application was made or the foreign divorce took effect. There is also another basis for jurisdiction, which doesn't apply in this case but I'll mention it anyway, because the wife could have come within this provision had she wanted to. And that provision is that if either of the parties had a beneficial interest in a property that had been a matrimonial home in this jurisdiction, if you invoke that limb of jurisdiction, then the claimant is restricted to the amount of the beneficial interest. In other words, you can't get more than the beneficial interest that's owned by the other spouse. The second safeguard, to guard against forum shopping, was a filter process in the form of an Ex parte application before a High Court judge, for leave to bring the Part 3 application. The purpose of that was obviously to filter out unmeritorious applications before the other spouse was involved in the proceedings. The third safeguard was consideration by the judge of what the Commissioner's described as some specific guidelines, which we will see in due course, because these guidelines became incorporated in section 16, which is the main statutory provisions that we're concerned with in this case. And those guidelines were to assist the court in the exercise of its discretion to determine whether it was appropriate for the English court to make an order, and these guidelines, as we shall see, focus on connection to this jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction in which the foreign divorce was made, and then on financial matters arising in the jurisdictions. There was no issue in this case at any stage about jurisdiction. The wife based her application on her habitual residents here. Of some significance we say, in this case, is the fact that the wife was acquitted of forum shopping. The very feature of the reforms that the Law Commissioners were concerned about. Mr Justice Munby, who dealt with the Ex parte application and then the inter-parties application brought by the husband to set aside the granted leave. On the papers before him, acquitted the wife of forum shopping. If I could ask you please to turn to the bound volume and appendix 1, what I'd like to refer you please to page 45, which is his judgement. It's page 45, paragraph 58, towards the bottom of the page.

They were dealing with a situation where no order had been made by the foreign court. I'm just reading four lines down from the top of page 2. Such a woman may thus face destitution, and her only source of financial support may be supplementary benefit, and if benefit is paid to her, the supplementary benefits authorities will have no legal right to recover the sums paid from the husband, since he will no longer be a 'liable' relative. The fact that the husband lives in this country and has substantial assets here makes no difference to the legal position. And that concern about being a drain on the public part is also a factor in this case because as a result of the Court of Appeal decision, the wife has been deprived of the means to provide a modest property for herself. And if she wants to remain living in London, where she has lived for the last 10 years, she will have to apply for local authority housing, and I will develop this point in due course.
4	p1,02:13:07.020,02:16:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Dealing with my next section about how Part 3 should be applied, we have already dealt with the problem about the statutory language once the gate is opened and the way the Law Commissioners dealt with the case, and I'd like to make these submissions, that the discretionary powers of the court under Part 3 should be operated, we say, in a flexible way, focused on remitting the hardship and providing a bespoke solution. And that is because the circumstances that will arise in these cases, which involve other jurisdictions, will be so varied in each and every case. It's often said in domestic cases that no two cases are the same and cases are fact specific, and decided on specific facts, and of course that's correct. But in a Part 3 case where there has been a prior financial order, the range of circumstances that the court has to look at under section 16 are very considerable and will vary so much from case to case because you're obviously dealing with different nationalities and different countries. So that's why we say it should be flexible and focused on providing a bespoke solution. And if it's applied within that sort of framework where it's aiming to remit, the hardship that can be identified, then these majority of tags about being a second bite of the cherry really are not that, and if the English court makes an order supplementing the foreign order, in those sort of circumstances, then it would be wrong to characteristics that as being an appeal from the order of the foreign court because my learned friend is going to say we just had a second bite of the cherry. It was all canvassed in Nigeria, and that what Mr Justice Coleridge was doing was the acting as the Court of Appeal on the order made in Nigeria, but we say no, because the whole purpose is a flexible solution aimed at dealing with the injustice that can be seen. And we also submit that when the court considers whether or not it's appropriate to make an order, as part of all the circumstances of the case, it has to consider the impact on the state purse because as a result of a foreign order, a Part 3 applicant may be reduced to being being reliant upon state benefits or having to apply for local authority accommodation. And that is a very relevant factor in most Part 3 cases because the applicant in nine cases out of 10 is going to be here, in order to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements, and his or her target may very well be a property in this country that he or she wants to live in. And we say it is contrary to public policy to cast upon the public person obligation that should really be born within the family. If the means can be found to provide for the wife, then why should the public person have to pay? And that, we say, is a relevant argument when we come to consider comity.

I say the application of section 16 because Section 16 is not obscurely worded. It does not give rise to any difficulties of construction. But it is very widely worded and accordingly, it gives rise to the danger that different courts may take different approaches and possibly radically different approaches, which would be liable to lead to very different results on very similar facts. The basic structure of Section 16, which is very similar to Section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act with which all auxiliary relief practitioners have engraved on their hearts because --

But there was a property here that the Italian court had not dealt with. Then the wife would be able to apply here under Part Three to deal with the, the property in this jurisdiction. And there would be no risk of conflicting judgments because Brussels One would not apply to her claim in England because it would be a claim dealing with rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship.

Although the above orders do not compel action by the trustees or managers of the respective pension schemes, the court has entered the orders with the expectation that if enforcement is necessary, the English court will in effect, enforce the orders of the interests of comity under Part 3 of the English Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, if husband is domiciled in England. So this is a good example of what we would say is the evolving nature of Part 3. You can actually have a foreign court recognising that it doesn't have the requisite powers to make the orders at once and therefore it relies on the English court to enforce its orders through invoking the powers under Part 3.

Section 12 permits the application for financial relief following an overseas divorce. And you will note that the breadth of the provision was quite wide because either party to the marriage may apply. There is no restriction on the application being made just by the respondent in the foreign divorce. You could actually have a situation where the petitioner in the foreign divorce was able to apply here. I think I'll check this, but I think the position is different in Scotland. Section 13.

B, there is no distinction in section 18 between how you approach the case, whether or not there has been no financial order abroad or whether there has been a financial order abroad. And there's no distinction as to how you assess the foreign order in terms of the order that you make in England. Once you're through the gates, you can have all the powers that you can make under the domestic legislation in the Matrimonial Causes Act, and you work on the same principles, as you would decide a conventional application. The only exception is if you bring a claim based on there being a beneficial interest in the property here. In other words, if you don't rely on habitual residence or domicile. The restrictive approach to the provision of further financial relief really comes from the -- from what the Law Commission has said about providing for an occasion hard case and remitting hardship.
5	p1,00:02:06.220,00:06:04.260,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes. We saw the authors it listed in the report. The two circumstances that the Law Commissioners were addressing were these. Firstly, when a foreign court had made no financial order at all, and secondly, where the foreign court had made a financial order, but that order was inadequate. And this appeal is concerned only with the second category. It is a condition precedent to the exercise of powers under Part 3 that the wife has to show in the circumstances of her case that a serious injustice has arisen. The serious injustice that this wife relies upon is that after a marriage of 32 years, which produced five children of the family and where the assets were around £700,000, the Nigerian court in June of 2005 awarded her a lump sum of £21,000 and a life interest in the house on Tin Can Island in Lagos. This very modest award produced a very significant disparity, or discrepancy, in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife was left in a position in which she did not own any one of the four properties in the case, two of which were in Lagos and two of which were in London. She was only left with a life interest in the property, that it ceased to be her main home in 1999, six years before the Nigerian court had made its order. In 1999, when the marriage broke down, she came to London to live at 27 Litton Road in New Barnet, a property which the husband had owned from 1975, and which had thereafter been used as a base for the family during the marriage. The trial judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, found that these parties had a long standing and enduring connection with this jurisdiction, and on the basis that the wife forfeited her life interest in the Tin Can Island property, in her husband's favour, he made the following order under Part 3. He ordered the Litton Road be sold and that the wife receives 65% of the net proceeds of sale, which was intended on the valuation used in the proceedings to give her about £275,000, which was to be used as follows. £225,000 to buy herself a modest flat in North London, and £50,000 as a cash sum to supplement her income when she is unable to work. The wife is now aged 69. The Court of Appeal allowed the husband's appeal and dismissed the order for financial provision in Toto. As a consequence, the wife would be homeless in this country where she has been a citizen since 1972, and where she has made her home and worked as a carer for the last 10 years. The purpose of Part 3 was to remit hardship arising from the order of a foreign court. Yet, the Court of Appeal have provided an outcome which Lord Justice Ward, who gave the lead judgement candidly admitted, has left the wife in a parlous plight. In making my submissions my lords and my lady, I want to address 5 topics. The first will be the policy issues considered by the Law Commissioners, which are material to this appeal. Secondly, the statutory provisions of part 3.
5	p1,02:08:51.750,02:11:33.280,spk_2,	False	
5	p1,00:10:27.300,00:20:34.350,spk_2,	True	Counsel: They pose the specific question. Should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? The difficulties in the way of reform of the law are thus formidable. They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied for financial relief in the country where the divorce was granted, but either failed to do so or did so, but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate. Correspondingly, the difficulties are least acute in cases where the law of the country where the divorce was granted contained no provision for financially relief in favour of the wife. We think there is little doubt that a wife who is thus unable to obtain any financial relief, should, provided she can establish a sufficient link between the marriage and this country, be eligible to apply for a financial order here. But we have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court to hear applications for financial relief, notwithstanding the existence of a prior foreign decree of divorce, should be exercisable only in such cases and not in cases where the foreign court had made, or could have made a financial order. We are, however, in no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one with which the marriage has much real connection, but there are also subsidiary arguments which seemed to us to support the view that a restriction of this kind would be undesirable. First, injustice could occur if the foreign divorce court, having dealt with part of a wife's claim for financial relief, could not or would not make any order in relation to capital assets in England, and the English court were precluded from making any order because of the foreign court's order. And my lords and my lady, we say that that really strikes at the very heart of this appeal because in the Nigerian court, the position was that they could not make an order to transfer Litton Road to the wife, and nor would they make any order for her to have a settlement of that property either. And as you will see when we go on to look at the statute, the Law Commissioner's view that there should be no restriction was actually enshrined in the statute, specifically in section 13(2), where the statute says that you can make an application, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order for financial provision. The foundation of Part 3 was based on the Law Commissioner's view that a foreign court which had granted the divorce was not necessarily the only court to deal with all issues arising from the divorce, and they came to this decision for for two reasons. First, they recognise the increasing international mobility, which meant that a marriage and the spouses can have connections with more than one jurisdiction and one legal system. Where they married, where they are domiciles, where they are nationals, and where they have lived during the marriage, pre and post separation, and where their assets are located, give them a connection with more than one jurisdiction. And if I could ask you, please, to look at paragraph 27 which is the preceding paragraph to the one that I just referred to, and just starting from the second sentence, it reads. In a world of pure legal analysis, it would no doubt be possible to identify a single system of law with which the marriage was more closely connected than any other. That system could then be regarded as the proper law of the marriage. As such, it would govern the marriage and its consequences. We do not, however, think that this aim can in practise, be achieved at a time when people can travel easily from one country to another. Marriages are increasingly connected with several different systems of law, for example, with the law of the party's nationality or the law of their place of residence, the place where the marriage was celebrated, or even with the law of their religion. In our view, it is unrealistic to suppose that a process of juristic analysis will identify any single right system of law to which all questions relevant to a particular marriage should be referred to the exclusion of all other systems. In this particular case, although it is right to say that during the marriage the parties spent most of their married life in Nigeria, they have a longstanding and enduring connection with this country. This case is a very good example, we say, of the sort of category of case that the Law Commissioners were considering in paragraph 27. There is no right or obvious jurisdiction to resolve all matters that arise in this case, and it's interesting perhaps, to make the point that both parties had jurisdiction to issue a petition for divorce in Nigeria, and in England. That shows the the connection. It is difficult when you look at the background to the case, which I'll come to a bit in more detail in the moment, it's difficult to identify any aspect of the party's lives that did not have a connection with England, from the very beginning. They met here, married here, and the husband still owns two properties here. They are dual nationals, and perhaps the most striking feature of the case, from a financial point of view, is that 75% of the parties' wealth is not in Nigeria, but it's in England. The second reason for the Law Commission as rejecting the principle that only one court should decide all financial matters consequent on divorce, was that the commissioners recognised that an injustice could arise when the foreign court had made an order which was inadequate and produced a serious injustice. This inadequacy could arise in a number of different ways. First, the foreign court might not have extensive powers to make financial orders. It might be only able to make orders for maintenance, as opposed to orders for lump sum or, as we have in this country, property adjustment. Secondly, the foreign court might not have the power to make orders in respect of property, especially immovable property outside its territorial jurisdiction. This meant that a property in England would be outside the ambit, or could be outside the ambit of a foreign order. And also lastly, of significance in this particular case, is that foreign courts do not necessarily have the range of orders that courts can exercise in this country. The range of orders might be very limited, as was the position here where the Nigerian court, it is common ground, only has power to order a settlement of property and not an order for property adjustment, which transfers the ownership of property from one spouse to another. Also underlying the Act was the Law Commissioner's concern about the financial burden that could be thrust on the public purse, if the effect of the foreign order made inadequate provision, and that is referred to not only in the report but also in the working paper. If I could just ask you please to turn back in tab 1 to page 2, it's the second page of the Commissioner's report. They were dealing with a situation where no order had been made by the foreign court. I'm just reading four lines down from the top of page 2. Such a woman may thus face destitution, and her only source of financial support may be supplementary benefit, and if benefit is paid to her, the supplementary benefits authorities will have no legal right to recover the sums paid from the husband, since he will no longer be a 'liable' relative. The fact that the husband lives in this country and has substantial assets here makes no difference to the legal position. And that concern about being a drain on the public part is also a factor in this case because as a result of the Court of Appeal decision, the wife has been deprived of the means to provide a modest property for herself. And if she wants to remain living in London, where she has lived for the last 10 years, she will have to apply for local authority housing, and I will develop this point in due course.

5	p2,01:44:40.000,01:47:11.510,spk_0,	True	Counsel: If so, what principles should the English court plan deciding whether or not to make an order in her favour? The root of the difficult and intractable problems thus raised is that different countries have different policies about the scope and purpose of the law governing financial provision. In English law, the court is directed to have regard to all the circumstances of the case and then, of course, the follows there the tail end of the former section 25 which was repealed by a different part of the ninth of the same 1984 statute, which were considering. And English law may seem to adopt the principle that party should be placed in the position, which could have resulted if the marriage had continued with. Other countries, in contrast, have adopted different policies, and then some countries adopt a rehabilitative approach. And there is some narrative there about the possible different approaches of different countries. And Section 25 goes on to the applicants conduct. Yes, Um, so these questions are raised, Um, and the law commission plainly finds them extremely difficult questions, but it seeks to answer them in so far as it does at the beginning of Paragraph 27. And I don't think we looked at the first sentence of paragraph 27. These questions all pose the same fundamental difficulty of deciding which of two or more legal systems with which the parties marriages in some way connected should apply to the financial and other consequences of termination. And then we learned French read out the passage, which follows a world of pure legal analysis. It would no doubt be possible to identify a single system. And we do not give, however, that the same can in practise be achieved. But what I would suggest the law Commission is, they're saying, is that although it may not be possible to establish a single system with which the marriage is most closely connected, and that is one reason why applications under what is now part three should not be barred merely because there has been an order in a foreign court. Nevertheless, consideration of the system with which the parties have the closest connection is highly relevant. When the court comes to consider on a factual basis the problems which are illustrated in paragraph 24 25 26. And so we have here forum conveniens principles beginning to come in.

Section 28 deals with circumstances in which a Scottish court may entertain an application for financial provision, and it says where parties to a marriage have been divorced in an overseas country, then subject to subsection 4, below, if the jurisdictional requirements and the conditions set out in subsections 2 and 3, below respectively, are satisfied, the court may entertain by one of the parties for an order for financial provision. And then the jurisdictional requirements are more onerous in Scotland because the applicant has to show not only domicile or habitual residency but also as you can see under b, that the other party was domiciled or habitually resident at the appropriate time or owned a property in Scotland.

Section 16 incorporates the specific guidelines that the Law Commissioners were talking about, that the judge would consider in the exercise of his discretion. And under Section 16(1), it reads, before making an order for financial relief, the court shall consider whether, in all the circumstances of the case, it would be appropriate for such an order to be made by a court in England and Wales, and if the court is not satisfied that it would be appropriate, the court will dismiss the application. And then in subsection 2, it states the court shall in particular had regard to the following matters. And before we look at those, what the test is setting out in the test of appropriateness is a general consideration of all the circumstances of the case and then the specific matters in subsection 2 A, B and C, which deal with connection to England and Wales, B is connection to, in this case Nigeria. C is connection to any other country which isn't relevant in this case, and then D, E, F and G all deal really with the financial matters arising in each jurisdiction. D doesn't arise here because that concerns an agreement arising in a foreign jurisdiction that would, for example, be if the parties had had a post or prenuptial agreement --

It is thus our view that in some circumstances the court in England should have power to make a financial order in favour of a former spouse whose marriage has been terminated by foreign decree. However, we found considerable difficulty in defining it precisely what circumstances such a power should be exercisable. In our view, the advantage of giving a remedy needs to be very carefully balanced, and not only against the risks of forum shopping. That is a risk that litigants with little on a real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that confer such a power on the courts. Would, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply to the incidence of a particular marriage, those problems which which will be difficult, if not impossible, to solve Could I just say there that the definition which is put forward their for forum shopping is, we would say only one aspect of the possible categories of forum shopping. And that's another aspect of foreign shopping is we say what happened in this case where somebody tries to ride two horses and and then at the bottom of paragraph 20 for the bottom of the page. After dealing with the hypothetical rural Taney. In example, problems could arise even if the wife were able to make a claim of financial relief and in fact did so but either failed to obtain any order or obtained an order which he thought to be inadequate. Should she be able to apply to the English court?

5	p3,00:42:45.150,00:44:34.950,spk_1,	True	Counsel: At paragraph 19 at page 429, Mr Justice Coleridge states that all events on 29 -- 23rd, October 1973, the Johannesburg Divorce Court dissolved the marriage made in order that the defendant forfeit the benefits of community of marriage and that the plaintiff pay maintenance for the said children at £130 a month. That is the only order that has ever been made governing the financial position between the parties prior to the institution of these proceedings. And so the position was that the wife's claims had never been tested. No order had ever been made in favour of the wife in South Africa, so this is perhaps the closest which we come to the court's approach in circumstances where no foreign order has been made because the only order related to the community of property regime and a specific order for the children and in those circumstances, again not surprisingly, Mr Justice Coleridge felt it appropriate to make an order and one sees at paragraph 39 that his approach whilst at this stage, by operation of section 17 and 18, the application becomes in all but name a conventional ancillary relief application set against this very unusual factual background. So in that context, even though it is right for the court to consider the application, is it right to make any order? And if so what? I have to consider all the factors under section 25. And he then proceeds to do so, um, and makes his order and sets out a schedule of the husband's significant assets.
5	p1,00:37:35.830,00:40:21.830,spk_2,	True	Counsel: We can see how they expected the new regime to operate. Paragraph 51. Having rejected proposals for a rigid bar on applications, we are left with the alternative of a flexible discretion under which, although an application could be presented by any person able to satisfy the jurisdictional test that we have recommended, such applications would be the subject of preliminary scrutiny by the court, which would only allow the applicant to proceed if, in the circumstances, it was thought appropriate to do so. In the general formulation of the proposed discretion, we think that it should be made clear by express statutory provisions that the object of the discretion is to provide for the quote occasional hard case. We consider, therefore, that the court should be given power to entertain an application for a financial provision or property adjustment order, notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce, if in the light of all the circumstances of the case, and in the particular certain specified circumstances, the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise. Our present inclination is not to favour any requirement that the applicant must establish the facts of the case to be exceptional, since he may well belong to a religious or ethnic group in which it is not uncommon, for example, for a wife should be divorced abroad without having a right to claim financial relief. And if I could just ask you please to turn to page 109, paragraph 66, which is the concluding paragraph of the working paper, just to pick up the point about the condition precedent, the Law Commission has considered whether a Part 3 application could be made if another court in the British Isles have made in order. In other words, if a Scottish court had made an order, could you then come to England for a Part 3 order, and they decided no. And just reading the last paragraph, they said it would nevertheless, in our view, be inappropriate to allow those divorced elsewhere in the British Isles to apply to the courts in England and Wales for financial orders. There will be few, if any, cases in which a person divorced in another part of the British Isles will have suffered 'serious injustice', which we believe it should be necessary to establish as a condition, precedent in the exercise of the powers that we propose.

And then just skipping a paragraph, he said, in my judgement, the wife has established that it is appropriate for the English court to intervene where she has been resident here since 1999 and where I am satisfied that she will continue to make her main home here, where she has her doctor and her English state benefits. I am satisfied that she is not misleading the court with a false case, and this is an appropriate case for an order, despite the Nigerian proceedings. So, my lords, we say that she was acquitted of of the Law Commission's main concern about foreign shopping. The Law Commission has considered that the regime that they wanted to provide for would be a flexible discretionary regime, and if I could ask you please to go back to the authorities bundle, bundle 1.

She testified as to her contribution towards deposit of 27 Lytton Road that he used his name to buy it, she put a caution on it. So it does appear that bearing in mind that these proceedings in Nigeria will spread over a considerable period of time with a day or two here followed by a day or two there some months later, that in the early stages of the Nigerian proceedings the wife did in fact give evidence supporting her claim to an equitable interest in Lytton Road. And it was only, it seems at a later stage that she sought to backtrack from that and say that she wanted the English Court to deal with it.
6	p1,00:33:50.890,00:36:13.460,spk_2,	True	Counsel: It is that. In fact, as you would have seen from the Justice Coleridge, there is criticism about whether the procedure is working effectively or not. At page 65 please, in Mr Justice Coleridge's judgement, and if I could ask you please to look at the the top of the page, the second paragraph, Mr Justice Coleridge said the husband's cases as to section 16 is that the parties connection with this country has really subsisted since separation. Mr Scott asked why the husband should be responsible for the wife's choice to live here, at very considerable extra cost. He says this would be grossly unfair on the husband whose own case stroke evidence was that he himself could not afford to reside here. Mr Scott does not shrink from accusing the wife of blatant forum shopping, crawling the globe to obtain a favourable order, and says that this is no more and no less than an appeal from the Nigerian court. He says that it is not appropriate for this court to start meddling in matters already litigated in Nigeria. That this is a black and white case in which the wife should be stopped. If I could ask you please to go down to the bottom of the page, just picking up the the thread of that argument, he says, the parties have a longstanding and real connection with the UK, its culture, and way of life. They are British citizens, all the children are British and were born here. The wife is unquestionably resident here and has strong connections here. She would say that she has been so for a very long time. There are issues as to when the wife came here for the long term, and I have been shown a schedule based on her passport, which I accept. I also accept the wife has spent the vast majority of her time here in the period from 1999 to 2005, she has been in this country now for nearly 10 years. Apart from that, the parties bought two properties here, one in 1975 and one in 2002. The children were all educated here as a result of which they themselves have property here. It was apparent also that each of the children spent at least part of their time here and regarding England as an important part of their lives.
6	p2,00:50:04.330,00:50:49.690,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The Nigerian court made an order for financial provision that produced very significant disparity in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife gave evidence to the Nigerian court that she said New Barnet is my home and that resulted in order for a life interest in a property that she had left six years earlier. The Nigerian court failed to provide adequate financial relief and caused this wife serious financial hardship at her age, at 69, what greater hardship can there be than to be homeless? We say that the court repeal lost sight of the underlying purpose of part 3, which is to remit financial hardship arising from a foreign order. In construing the provisions of Section 16, they imposed a test by looking at the forum conveniens test that was not contemplated by the Law Commission and is far too restrictive a test and will shut out virtually all applications when a foreign court has made a financial order.

Plot 2 on Tin Can Island is the house on Tin Can Island that had been the main family home when the parties were living in Nigeria. That's the property that the wife had the life interest.

And as I mentioned the children, four of them have a property in this country. See my lord, the longstanding and enduring connection of this family to this country is very significant, and in particular in relation to Litton Road, there has been a rather sterile debate of whether it was a matrimonial home or not. Well, if a matrimonial home is defined as being their main matrimonial home for most of the marriage, then it probably wouldn't be because that would have been in Nigeria.

They are not to use the words of the law commissioners, birds of passage. It's where they met and married. It's where the Children were born and bar one were educated. They have lived and worked here in the past and visited here regularly, and the connection here is best illustrated by their dual nationality. The husband has owned a property here since 1975. He studied here and obtained his professional qualifications here. Last year, 75% of their wealth was located in England. In this case, illustrates very well the law commissioner's report that it's unrealistic to actually try and identify one right system of law to which all questions can be referred to the exclusion of all others.

They started married life, living in London, and the husband worked here for eight years from 1965 to 1973, before he returned to practise law in Lagos. And during that period, when they lived here, the three children, the elder three children of the marriage, were born here. In 1972 they became British citizens. The wife joined him back in Nigeria in 1974, and in 1975 Litton Road was purchased. Her husband lived in Litton Road for two years between 1976 and 1978 when he was doing further studies here, and the wife joined him. And then the wife returned to England when their fourth child was born in 1980. It is significant that all the children, bar the youngest, were educated here, and Litton Road was used as a family base in London, and it has always been there for their exclusive occupation. It was never let out. It was available for the family. And as the husband said in his affidavit to the court, he used to come over once or twice a month to see the children and in connection with his practise, and on his case, the wife came over at least twice a year for not more than two weeks at a time so that she could see the children, and it's quite clear that he accepted that they both paid regular visits to London, and even after the marriage had ended in 1999, when the wife came to live in Litton Road, the husband bought another property in London, at 26 Windmill Drive. From the disclosure in the case, it's clear that he, not surprisingly, perhaps, has a bank account in London with NatWest. 
6	p3,01:10:41.990,01:11:29.340,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Four of them own properties here. But only two of them work here. They are an international Nigerian family to that degree, at least at the generation of the children. But Your Lordship's point, which might be valid in many cases, simply doesn't apply in this case -- is what we haven't looked into is the extent to which that if the children are here, that it is they who followed their mother rather than their mother following them. But in any event, My Lord, it is it is very different according to whether the place where the wife goes on the breakdown of the marriage is one with which she has had a really substantial connection and is especially if it's her home country or here, where she's coming back to England, where she hasn't lived for over 20 years.

And it is within the remit of the Act to alleviate hardship, and therefore it is appropriate to make an order. But that, in our submission, entirely begs the question of whether the wife should be entitled to come to this country after the breakdown of the marriage, pursue a lifestyle which I'm not suggesting it's in any way extravagant but is inevitably more expensive living in London than living in Lagos and to look to the husband to support that. And it was the husband's case and his evidence, as is recited in the judgment, that he could not afford to live in London. And although the parties had lived together in London in the early years of the marriage, they had lived in Lagos for the 20 years preceding the breakdown of the marriage. And that's a conservative figure. There was some dispute, but that's the minimum figure, 20 years. And so I asked the, what I say, important rhetorical question, Why should the wife be entitled to come to this country, establish a way of life here without any consent from the husband, or encouragement from the husband and then claim that it would be hardship if she is not entitled to maintain that way of life which she has herself established.

The wife is represented in the Nigerian jurisdiction, has appeared there throughout by her Nigerian lawyers. She has apparently never taken the jurisdictional point there, that is she did not challenge the jurisdiction of the Nigerian court to determine the divorce suit and has not only acquiesced in the process but has taken positive steps in the same, for example, issuing a cross petition and obtaining orders for substituted service. Were the courts in Nigeria to come to an appropriate conclusion, she would on the facts of her own case as pleaded here, have the right to apply in the United Kingdom for permission to make an application in relation to the United Kingdom assets of the couple, and he goes on to complain that her evidence is defective. But on page 212 he says, I've come to the following conclusions as reasons for the decision I have made. And those are set out numbers one to eight.  
7	p2,01:29:41.760,01:30:27.610,spk_0,	True	Well, My Lord, with respect, I don't accept that analysis. The position is that as my learned friend himself has pointed out, the wife has been living here as the judge found since 1999. She could have started proceedings here at any point from somewhere in the middle of 2000. She chose not to do so. The husband started proceedings three years later in Nigeria in 283. The wife took a very full part in those proceedings. She was represented by counsel. There is some suggestion in the judgment of Mr Justice Rider that she applied at some point for a stay of those proceedings which was refused. Um, and she put forward her own submissions through counsel as to what would be the appropriate award. So this was not somebody, I have to be very careful how I put this, but this was the not the case shall we say, of an English wife who has married somebody from a jurisdiction which has no concept [inaudible] relief.
7	p1,01:39:02.380,01:39:36.740,spk_2,	True	Page 75, My Lord. 27 Litton road is an incumbent property. 26 Windmill Drive was the property that the husband purchased in 2002. Plot 2 on Tin Can Island is the house on Tin Can Island that had been the main family home when the parties were living in Nigeria. That's the property that the wife had the life interest in. 
7	p1,00:02:06.220,00:06:04.260,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes. We saw the authors it listed in the report. The two circumstances that the Law Commissioners were addressing were these. Firstly, when a foreign court had made no financial order at all, and secondly, where the foreign court had made a financial order, but that order was inadequate. And this appeal is concerned only with the second category. It is a condition precedent to the exercise of powers under Part 3 that the wife has to show in the circumstances of her case that a serious injustice has arisen. The serious injustice that this wife relies upon is that after a marriage of 32 years, which produced five children of the family and where the assets were around £700,000, the Nigerian court in June of 2005 awarded her a lump sum of £21,000 and a life interest in the house on Tin Can Island in Lagos. This very modest award produced a very significant disparity, or discrepancy, in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife was left in a position in which she did not own any one of the four properties in the case, two of which were in Lagos and two of which were in London. She was only left with a life interest in the property, that it ceased to be her main home in 1999, six years before the Nigerian court had made its order. In 1999, when the marriage broke down, she came to London to live at 27 Litton Road in New Barnet, a property which the husband had owned from 1975, and which had thereafter been used as a base for the family during the marriage. The trial judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, found that these parties had a long standing and enduring connection with this jurisdiction, and on the basis that the wife forfeited her life interest in the Tin Can Island property, in her husband's favour, he made the following order under Part 3. He ordered the Litton Road be sold and that the wife receives 65% of the net proceeds of sale, which was intended on the valuation used in the proceedings to give her about £275,000, which was to be used as follows. £225,000 to buy herself a modest flat in North London, and £50,000 as a cash sum to supplement her income when she is unable to work. The wife is now aged 69. The Court of Appeal allowed the husband's appeal and dismissed the order for financial provision in Toto. As a consequence, the wife would be homeless in this country where she has been a citizen since 1972, and where she has made her home and worked as a carer for the last 10 years. The purpose of Part 3 was to remit hardship arising from the order of a foreign court. Yet, the Court of Appeal have provided an outcome which Lord Justice Ward, who gave the lead judgement candidly admitted, has left the wife in a parlous plight. In making my submissions my lords and my lady, I want to address 5 topics. The first will be the policy issues considered by the Law Commissioners, which are material to this appeal. Secondly, the statutory provisions of part 3.
7	p1,00:28:54.680,00:29:46.350,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes, the circumstances were that the husband issued his petition in Nigeria in June of 2003, when she had been living here since 1999. So if she had been a classic forum shopper, she would have issued her application at the first opportunity, say, in the year 2000 when she would have been here for 12 months. So she didn't initiate a claim here at the first opportunity, but also, she issued a petition here, before she issued an answering cross petition in Nigeria. So she endeavoured to have the matter dealt with here, before she made a claim in Nigeria. But subsequently, Mr Justice Rider granted a stay of the husband on her petition here and refused to make an anti-suit injunction in her favour here.

At page 65 please, in Mr Justice Coleridge's judgement, and if I could ask you please to look at the the top of the page, the second paragraph, Mr Justice Coleridge said the husband's cases as to section 16 is that the parties connection with this country has really subsisted since separation.

It was apparent also that each of the children spent at least part of their time here and regarding England as an important part of their lives.
7	p2,00:18:17.240,00:21:40.950,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Mr. Justice Munby said, in the first place I do not think that Mr Mitchell has made good his assertion that the discretion exercised by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay under section 72 of the Nigerian matrimonial causes that was anything like as broad as that which would be exercisable by an English judge under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. On the contrary, the powerful arguments marshalled by Miss Harris strongly suggests to me that it is nothing like so wide and that, at least in relation to Capitol vision, the Nigerian jurisdiction is not fundamentally needs base at all. So it would seem that the wife was driven to litigate in Nigeria if she was to litigate there at all on a narrower and less favourable basis, than would have been the case if she had been litigating in this country. And Lord Justice Wilson at page 56 a few pages on in the Court of Appeal at the hearing of Mr Barges application for permission to appeal against Mr Justice Munby, was of the same view in the middle of paragraph 17 on page 56, he said. However, the analysis of Mr Justice Munby in relation to the way in which that claim was rejected in Nigeria may well prove to be relevant. It is strongly arguable that the claim was not dispatched by redistributive principles at all, whatever their precise nature, but rather by reference to principles, actual ownership to which we were in this jurisdiction were confined prior to the reforms introduced in 1971. Mr Scott submits that such a conclusion cannot be made even on a provisional basis without expert evidence as to the principles of Nigerian law which must have lain behind the Nigerian judge's rejection of the claim. With respect, I reject that submission. In my view, Mr Justice, Munby's recital of the way in which counsel's arguments in Nigeria were cast and the way in which the judge in Nigeria articulated her rejection of the wife's claim enables one provisionally to reach that conclusion. If such a conclusion is valid or arguably valid, then the comments made by Lord Justice Thorpe in Jordan, which the judge cited are in point. It may be that the failure of the wife to achieve transfer of that property in the Nigerian court was a result of the application of principles in no way comparable to those by reference to which we would dispatch such a claim. And in in his printed case, my learned friend has said that the English court made orders similar to the sort of order the Nigerian court made before the changes came in 1971 and that significant disparity between husband and wife in terms of their financial positions after an English ancillary relief order were not uncommon in the past, we submit that those arguments really are merely an exercise in in retrospection, arguing that the wife's award that she obtained in Nigeria would not be out of place in the 1960's is not a constructive way to approach this appeal. Family law, perhaps more than any other branch of the law, has to evolve to meet changing social mores and expectations. In the case of part three, we have the increasing mobility of people around the world over the last 25 years.

How can it be right to say that Nigeria shouldn't deal with the case? Well, the irony is that the judge who dealt with the application postulated the possibility of the wife making a Part 3 application in his judgement. I was dealing with the the forum shopping acquittal.
8	p3,00:42:45.150,00:44:34.950,spk_1,	True	Counsel: At paragraph 19 at page 429, Mr Justice Coleridge states that all events on 29 -- 23rd, October 1973, the Johannesburg Divorce Court dissolved the marriage made in order that the defendant forfeit the benefits of community of marriage and that the plaintiff pay maintenance for the said children at £130 a month. That is the only order that has ever been made governing the financial position between the parties prior to the institution of these proceedings. And so the position was that the wife's claims had never been tested. No order had ever been made in favour of the wife in South Africa, so this is perhaps the closest which we come to the court's approach in circumstances where no foreign order has been made because the only order related to the community of property regime and a specific order for the children and in those circumstances, again not surprisingly, Mr Justice Coleridge felt it appropriate to make an order and one sees at paragraph 39 that his approach whilst at this stage, by operation of section 17 and 18, the application becomes in all but name a conventional ancillary relief application set against this very unusual factual background. So in that context, even though it is right for the court to consider the application, is it right to make any order? And if so what? I have to consider all the factors under section 25. And he then proceeds to do so, um, and makes his order and sets out a schedule of the husband's significant assets.

The Nigerian court failed to provide adequate financial relief and caused this wife serious financial hardship at her age, at 69, what greater hardship can there be than to be homeless? We say that the court repeal lost sight of the underlying purpose of part 3, which is to remit financial hardship arising from a foreign order. In considering the provisions of Section 16, they imposed a test by looking at the forum conveniens test that was not contemplated by the Law Commission and is far too restrictive a test and will shut out virtually all applications when a foreign court has made a financial order.

So if she had been a classic forum shopper, she would have issued her application at the first opportunity, say, in the year 2000 when she would have been here for 12 months. So she didn't initiate a claim here at the first opportunity, but also, she issued a petition here, before she issued an answering cross petition in Nigeria. So she endeavoured to have the matter dealt with here, before she made a claim in Nigeria. But subsequently, Mr Justice Rider granted a stay of the husband on her petition here and refused to make an anti-suit injunction in her favour here.

8	p2,00:18:17.240,00:21:40.950,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Mr. Justice Munby said, in the first place I do not think that Mr Mitchell has made good his assertion that the discretion exercised by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay under section 72 of the Nigerian matrimonial causes that was anything like as broad as that which would be exercisable by an English judge under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. On the contrary, the powerful arguments marshalled by Miss Harris strongly suggests to me that it is nothing like so wide and that, at least in relation to Capitol vision, the Nigerian jurisdiction is not fundamentally needs base at all. So it would seem that the wife was driven to litigate in Nigeria if she was to litigate there at all on a narrower and less favourable basis, than would have been the case if she had been litigating in this country. And Lord Justice Wilson at page 56 a few pages on in the Court of Appeal at the hearing of Mr Barges application for permission to appeal against Mr Justice Munby, was of the same view in the middle of paragraph 17 on page 56, he said. However, the analysis of Mr Justice Munby in relation to the way in which that claim was rejected in Nigeria may well prove to be relevant. It is strongly arguable that the claim was not dispatched by redistributive principles at all, whatever their precise nature, but rather by reference to principles, actual ownership to which we were in this jurisdiction were confined prior to the reforms introduced in 1971. Mr Scott submits that such a conclusion cannot be made even on a provisional basis without expert evidence as to the principles of Nigerian law which must have lain behind the Nigerian judge's rejection of the claim. With respect, I reject that submission. In my view, Mr Justice, Munby's recital of the way in which counsel's arguments in Nigeria were cast and the way in which the judge in Nigeria articulated her rejection of the wife's claim enables one provisionally to reach that conclusion. If such a conclusion is valid or arguably valid, then the comments made by Lord Justice Thorpe in Jordan, which the judge cited are in point. It may be that the failure of the wife to achieve transfer of that property in the Nigerian court was a result of the application of principles in no way comparable to those by reference to which we would dispatch such a claim. And in in his printed case, my learned friend has said that the English court made orders similar to the sort of order the Nigerian court made before the changes came in 1971 and that significant disparity between husband and wife in terms of their financial positions after an English ancillary relief order were not uncommon in the past, we submit that those arguments really are merely an exercise in in retrospection, arguing that the wife's award that she obtained in Nigeria would not be out of place in the 1960's is not a constructive way to approach this appeal. Family law, perhaps more than any other branch of the law, has to evolve to meet changing social mores and expectations. In the case of part three, we have the increasing mobility of people around the world in the last 25 years.

But this was not the case, shall we say of an English wife who was married somebody from a jurisdiction which has no concept of ancillary relief, who has little opportunity to participate and no prospect of obtaining any award if she does go to X country where the divorce is taking place. This was a case of a Nigerian woman who, having over, foregone the opportunity to bring proceedings in this country, participated very fully in the Nigerian proceedings and a result was and then sought to change horses in the middle of these Nigerian proceedings, having initially sought a declaration in respect of the English property, she tried to withdraw from that but was not permitted to do so.

So it's perhaps not surprising that the wife failed in her anti-suit injunction. But if I could ask you please to turn to page 4 of the judgement and paragraph 7. Mr Justice Ryder said, were the courts in Nigeria to come to an appropriate conclusion, she would on the facts, if her own case was pleaded here, have the right to apply in the United Kingdom for permission to make an application in relation to the United Kingdom assets of the couple. So even though he was granting the anti-suit injunction, he was stating that it may well be an appropriate case for a Part 3 application.

So this is not somebody who has even exhausted her remedies in Nigeria before making this application, she gets an order in Nigeria which corresponds, as we shall see not too far to what she was seeking. And then within weeks, rather than appeal that and test the limits of the Nigerian jurisdiction starts her application here. And so I do not reside I'll, although this hasn't found favour in any of the various courts, which I've addressed the point. But I do not resolve from the proposition that his wife has been forum shopping and this application has been an exercise in form shopping.

9	p1,00:10:27.300,00:20:34.350,spk_2,	True	Counsel: They pose the specific question. Should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? The difficulties in the way of reform of the law are thus formidable. They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied for financial relief in the country where the divorce was granted, but either failed to do so or did so, but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate. Correspondingly, the difficulties are least acute in cases where the law of the country where the divorce was granted contained no provision for financially relief in favour of the wife. We think there is little doubt that a wife who is thus unable to obtain any financial relief, should, provided she can establish a sufficient link between the marriage and this country, be eligible to apply for a financial order here. But we have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court to hear applications for financial relief, notwithstanding the existence of a prior foreign decree of divorce, should be exercisable only in such cases and not in cases where the foreign court had made, or could have made a financial order. We are, however, in no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one with which the marriage has much real connection, but there are also subsidiary arguments which seemed to us to support the view that a restriction of this kind would be undesirable. First, injustice could occur if the foreign divorce court, having dealt with part of a wife's claim for financial relief, could not or would not make any order in relation to capital assets in England, and the English court were precluded from making any order because of the foreign court's order. And my lords and my lady, we say that that really strikes at the very heart of this appeal because in the Nigerian court, the position was that they could not make an order to transfer Litton Road to the wife, and nor would they make any order for her to have a settlement of that property either. And as you will see when we go on to look at the statute, the Law Commissioner's view that there should be no restriction was actually enshrined in the statute, specifically in section 13(2), where the statute says that you can make an application, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order for financial provision. The foundation of Part 3 was based on the Law Commissioner's view that a foreign court which had granted the divorce was not necessarily the only court to deal with all issues arising from the divorce, and they came to this decision for for two reasons. First, they recognise the increasing international mobility, which meant that a marriage and the spouses can have connections with more than one jurisdiction and one legal system. Where they married, where they are domiciles, where they are nationals, and where they have lived during the marriage, pre and post separation, and where their assets are located, give them a connection with more than one jurisdiction. And if I could ask you, please, to look at paragraph 27 which is the preceding paragraph to the one that I just referred to, and just starting from the second sentence, it reads. In a world of pure legal analysis, it would no doubt be possible to identify a single system of law with which the marriage was more closely connected than any other. That system could then be regarded as the proper law of the marriage. As such, it would govern the marriage and its consequences. We do not, however, think that this aim can in practise, be achieved at a time when people can travel easily from one country to another. Marriages are increasingly connected with several different systems of law, for example, with the law of the party's nationality or the law of their place of residence, the place where the marriage was celebrated, or even with the law of their religion. In our view, it is unrealistic to suppose that a process of juristic analysis will identify any single right system of law to which all questions relevant to a particular marriage should be referred to the exclusion of all other systems. In this particular case, although it is right to say that during the marriage the parties spent most of their married life in Nigeria, they have a longstanding and enduring connection with this country. This case is a very good example, we say, of the sort of category of case that the Law Commissioners were considering in paragraph 27. There is no right or obvious jurisdiction to resolve all matters that arise in this case, and it's interesting perhaps, to make the point that both parties had jurisdiction to issue a petition for divorce in Nigeria, and in England. That shows the the connection. It is difficult when you look at the background to the case, which I'll come to a bit in more detail in the moment, it's difficult to identify any aspect of the party's lives that did not have a connection with England, from the very beginning. They met here, married here, and the husband still owns two properties here. They are dual nationals, and perhaps the most striking feature of the case, from a financial point of view, is that 75% of the parties' wealth is not in Nigeria, but it's in England. The second reason for the Law Commission as rejecting the principle that only one court should decide all financial matters consequent on divorce, was that the commissioners recognised that an injustice could arise when the foreign court had made an order which was inadequate and produced a serious injustice. This inadequacy could arise in a number of different ways. First, the foreign court might not have extensive powers to make financial orders. It might be only able to make orders for maintenance, as opposed to orders for lump sum or, as we have in this country, property adjustment. Secondly, the foreign court might not have the power to make orders in respect of property, especially immovable property outside its territorial jurisdiction. This meant that a property in England would be outside the ambit, or could be outside the ambit of a foreign order. And also lastly, of significance in this particular case, is that foreign courts do not necessarily have the range of orders that courts can exercise in this country. The range of orders might be very limited, as was the position here where the Nigerian court, it is common ground, only has power to order a settlement of property and not an order for property adjustment, which transfers the ownership of property from one spouse to another. Also underlying the Act was the Law Commissioner's concern about the financial burden that could be thrust on the public purse, if the effect of the foreign order made inadequate provision, and that is referred to not only in the report but also in the working paper. If I could just ask you please to turn back in tab 1 to page 2, it's the second page of the Commissioner's report. They were dealing with a situation where no order had been made by the foreign court. I'm just reading four lines down from the top of page 2. Such a woman may thus face destitution, and her only source of financial support may be supplementary benefit, and if benefit is paid to her, the supplementary benefits authorities will have no legal right to recover the sums paid from the husband, since he will no longer be a 'liable' relative. The fact that the husband lives in this country and has substantial assets here makes no difference to the legal position. And that concern about being a drain on the public part is also a factor in this case because as a result of the Court of Appeal decision, the wife has been deprived of the means to provide a modest property for herself. And if she wants to remain living in London, where she has lived for the last 10 years, she will have to apply for local authority housing, and I will develop this point in due course.

9	p3,01:07:51.030,01:09:21.140,spk_1,	True	Counsel: We say in our printed case that hardship is almost as elastic a concept as fairness, and that the -- both Mr Justice Munby and Mr Justice Coleridge approached this case on the basis that the wife has been living in England since 1999, for her not to have a home would amount to a hardship. And it is within the remit of the Act to alleviate hardship, and therefore it is appropriate to make an order. But that, in our submission, entirely begs the question of whether the wife should be entitled to come to this country after the breakdown of the marriage, pursue a lifestyle which I'm not suggesting it's in any way extravagant but is inevitably more expensive living in London than living in Lagos and to look to the husband to support that. And it was the husband's case and his evidence, as is recited in the judgment, that he could not afford to live in London. And although the parties had lived together in London in the early years of the marriage, they had lived in Lagos for the 20 years preceding the breakdown of the marriage. And that's a conservative figure. There was some dispute, but that's the minimum figure, 20 years. And so I asked the, what I say, important rhetorical question, Why should the wife be entitled to come to this country, establish a way of life without any consent from the husband or encouragement from the husband and then claim that it would be a hardship if she is not entitled to maintain that way of life that she has herself established. 
9	p2,00:50:04.330,00:50:49.690,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The Nigerian court made an order for financial provision that produced very significant disparity in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife gave evidence to the Nigerian court that she said New Barnet is my home and that resulted in order for a life interest in a property that she had left six years earlier. The Nigerian court failed to provide adequate financial relief and caused this wife serious financial hardship at her age, at 69, what greater hardship can there be than to be homeless? We say that the court repeal lost sight of the underlying purpose of part 3, which is to remit financial hardship arising from a foreign order. In considering the provisions of Section 16, they imposed a test by looking at the forum conveniens test that was not contemplated by the Law Commission and is far too restrictive a test and will shut out virtually all applications when a foreign court has made a financial order.
9	p3,00:42:45.150,00:44:34.950,spk_1,	True	Counsel: At paragraph 19 at page 429, Mr Justice Coleridge states all events on 29 -- 23rd, October 1973, the Johannesburg Divorce Court dissolved the marriage made in order that the defendant forfeit the benefits of community of marriage and that the plaintiff pay maintenance for the said children at £130 a month. That is the only order that has ever been made governing the financial position between the parties prior to the institution of these proceedings. And so the position was that the wife's claims had never been tested. No order had ever been made in favour of the wife in South Africa, so this is perhaps the closest which we come to the court's approach in circumstances where no foreign order has been made because the only order related to the community of property regime and a specific order for the children and in those circumstances, again not surprisingly, Mr Justice Coleridge felt it appropriate to make an order and one sees at paragraph 39 that his approach whilst at this stage, by operation of section 17 and 18, the application becomes in all but name a conventional ancillary relief application set against this very unusual factual background. So in that context, even though it is right for the court to consider the application, is it right to make any order? And if so what? I have to consider all the factors under section 25. And he then proceeds to do so, um, and makes his order and sets out a schedule of the husband's significant assets.
9	p1,00:21:54.940,00:27:06.170,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In our view, the advantage of giving a remedy needs to be very carefully balanced, not only against the risks of forum shopping. That is the risk that litigants with little or no real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that to confer such a power on the courts could, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply, to the incidence of a particular marriage, pose problems which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to resolve. Where we don't need to be concerned about the applicable law in the case because English law is applied, and in Scotland, Scots Law is applied. In order to meet their concerns about forum shopping, the Law Commissioners proposed three specific safeguards. The first, where jurisdictional requirements based on those four divorce proceedings. They considered that the party should, or either of the party should be domiciled in England and Wales, at the time the application was made, or when the foreign divorce order was made or alternatively, either of the parties could be habitually resident in this jurisdiction for a period of 12 months, either before the application was made or the foreign divorce took effect. There is also another basis for jurisdiction, which doesn't apply in this case but I'll mention it anyway, because the wife could have come within this provision had she wanted to. And that provision is that if either of the parties had a beneficial interest in a property that had been a matrimonial home in this jurisdiction, if you invoke that limb of jurisdiction, then the claimant is restricted to the amount of the beneficial interest. In other words, you can't get more than the beneficial interest that's owned by the other spouse. The second safeguard, to guard against forum shopping, was a filter process in the form of an Ex parte application before a High Court judge, for leave to bring the Part 3 application. The purpose of that was obviously to filter out unmeritorious applications before the other spouse was involved in the proceedings. The third safeguard was consideration by the judge of what the Commissioner's described as some specific guidelines, which we will see in due course, because these guidelines became incorporated in section 16, which is the main statutory provisions that we're concerned with in this case. And those guidelines were to assist the court in the exercise of its discretion to determine whether it was appropriate for the English court to make an order, and these guidelines, as we shall see, focus on connection to this jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction in which the foreign divorce was made, and then on financial matters arising in the jurisdictions. There was no issue in this case at any stage about jurisdiction. The wife based her application on her habitual residents here. Of some significance we say, in this case, is the fact that the wife was acquitted of forum shopping. The very feature of the reforms that the Law Commissioners were concerned about. Mr Justice Munby, who dealt with the Ex parte application and then the inter-parties application brought by the husband to set aside the granted leave. On the papers before him, acquitted the wife of forum shopping. If I could ask you please to turn to the bound volume and appendix 1, what I'd like to refer you please to page 45, which is his judgement. It's page 45, paragraph 58, towards the bottom of the page. Little Roman two.
9	p1,00:44:19.790,00:46:30.340,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Section 13, is the filter process. It's the applicant having to apply to the High Court judge for leave to begin an application for financial relief, and in sub-paragraph one will see it reads. No application for an order for financial relief shall be made under this part of this Act, unless the leave of the court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court, and the court shall not grant leave unless it considers that there is a substantial ground for the making of an application for such an order. The subsections that follow are of some importance in this case. Subsection 2 is the one I mentioned earlier, which is statutory recognition for the fact that the court may make a Part 3 order, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order that provided for a payment or transfer of property to the applicant or a child of the family. That permits the dual application, and subsection 3 is also important, as will be developed in due course. Leave under this under this section may be granted subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit. This appeal does not really concern the Ex parte stage because, as your lordships and my lady will know, the husband appealed. Mr Justice Munby's decision not to set aside the Ex parte granted leave, and it was referred to Lord Justice Thorpe on paper who refused the application, and then there was an oral hearing in which my learned friend appeared before Lord Justice Warren Wilson, who dismissed the application and gave judgments. I don't want to spend too much time on this, although I would like to just briefly refer you to the leading case of Holmes because it is relevant to some extent, to our appeal.
9	p1,00:55:35.760,01:04:31.320,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes he is, I agree. If we could please, then turn to page 59. This is the short judgement of Lord Justice Russell, which is often quoted in these cases and indeed was quoted in this case by Mr Justice Munby, reading from the second sentence, the test in section 31 is in my judgement, plainly, a more stringent one, that's referring to judicial review. Prima facie, the order of the foreign court should prevail, save in exceptional circumstances, and a good case for any interference with it or adjustment of it or any supplementation of it should be apparent before any leave is granted under section 13, where the foreign court is properly seizing the dispute, as it was in this case. So far as it is possible, duplicity of proceedings should be avoided in this, as in all other fields and in the interests of the parties and their children, as well as in the interests of justice and the comity of nations. So he sees it as a strict test, a hard test, where there has been a foreign order. He's talking about exceptional circumstances, although the statute doesn't refer to that, and the and the Law Commission has actually said they did not want it to cover an exceptional case. But what is significant in my submission is the use of the word supplementation. Because what really happened here was that there was supplementation of the Nigerian order. And could we please look at Mr Justice Munby's judgement, again, it's in the bound volume. At appendix 1, page 47. It is paragraphs 59 and 60. This is how he dealt with the substantial ground test. At the end of the day, the real issue seems to me to be the same as it was when this case was first before me. To paraphrase what I said in my earlier judgement, is this in truth, simply a case where a wife is seeking to have a second bite of the cherry following proceedings in a foreign country which, although not satisfactory from her point of view and although not as generous from her point of view as comparable proceedings, would be in this country were nevertheless appropriately conducted and which led to a financial order in her favour, which can be and has been implemented? Or is it, on the other hand, a case where the circumstances are sufficiently exceptional, using the word in the sense in which it was used by Lord Justice Russell, that notwithstanding the making of a significant order in her favour by the foreign court, it is nonetheless proper to enable her to pursue a second application in this country. In my judgement, this case falls into the latter category. What is in my judgement, the very considerable discrepancy, indeed, between the aggregate value of what this court would consider to be the relevant matrimonial assets, some of the most valuable being located in this country, and the very modest amount of the provisions made for this wife following a marriage of, I emphasise 32 years, justifies the conclusion that there is within the meaning of section 31 of the Act, substantial ground for her making the application. If I deny her relief, she will suffer hardship, in my judgement, very serious hardship indeed, being faced in all probability with the unenviable choice of either remaining homeless in this country, where she is now based and where she wants to stay, or returning to Nigeria. And the test that he applied there was approved by the Court of Appeal when the husband's application for leave to appeal was dismissed. Part 3 proceedings have attracted the pejorative tag of being a second bite of the cherry, and that description implies that a Part 3 application is a complete rerun of the same proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction, and that what happens is that all the issues are canvassed again before a different judge in a different country with a different adjudication sort. But, my lord, we say that that is not the purpose of Part 3, and that is certainly not how it was envisaged it would be utilised by the Commissioners. We say that a Part 3 application should be case managed and directed to achieve the purpose of remitting the hardship that has been identified arising from the foreign financial order. And this is something that Mr Justice Munby addressed and dealt with, and he imposed, as he could do, as you remember under section 13(3), stringent conditions as to how the case was to be run at the final hearing. And if we could read on, please, to paragraph 61 of his judgement, I think you still have the page open, he says, so in principle, and despite everything said by Mr Mitchell, I accept that the wife should have leave to make her claim. In saying this, I have, of course, had regard to each and every one of the various factors referred to in section 16(2) of the Act, but this is subject to one very important qualification. There is, as it seems to me, very considerable force indeed, in Mr Mitchell's submission that the husband should not be exposed to the kind of extensive and no doubt expensive proceedings which the wife apparently has in mind. In my judgement, this is a case where it can be can now be seen, even if it was less obvious when the matter was first before me, that I should attach conditions, stringent conditions, to my grant of leave. I'm not prepared to contemplate a rerun of the Nigerian proceedings. I am not prepared to contemplate the reopening of factual issues which have been the subject of decision by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay. I am not prepared to contemplate a process involving extensive further evidence, questionnaires and disclosure, nor do I think there is any need for further evaluation or other evidence in relation to the conditional value of the various Nigerian properties. The court already has enough information on these topics to enable it to do proper justice in a fair and proportionate manner, not least bearing in mind that I propose also to impose a condition limiting the wife's property claims to the Barnett property, that's 27 Litton Road. By this, I mean a condition preventing the wife making any claim, whether a proprietary claim, or a claim for property adjustment, or a claim for any other form of transfer, or vesting of property order, to or in relation to any real property, whether in this country or in Nigeria. Saving except only for a claim for property adjustment border in relation to the Barnett property. This will not, however, prevent the wife pursuing her claims for a lump sum order and a payments order. I propose, therefore, to make an order dispensing with many of the normal steps in an ancillary relief, including directions designed to ensure that the wife substantive claim can come on for hearing as quickly, and as cheaply as possible. I am quite sure that full justice can be done to both parties at a hearing lasting no more than one day, and in which there is little if any oral evidence. And he also proposed in the final paragraph, as you can see for an appropriate order to be drawn up by counsel, and if necessary for there to be an informal financial dispute resolution hearing before him, to see whether the matter could be settled. And just in terms of that, within a fortnight of his judgement being handed down, the wife made an open offer on the fourth of January of 2007 to accept a transfer of Litton Road, on the basis of no order as to costs, and a clean break. And on the 31st of January of 2007, the husband rejected that proposal, making no counterproposal in reply, and he appealed to the Court of Appeal. So that is why the case took longer to be resolved than Mr Justice Munby had envisaged.
9	p1,00:02:06.220,00:06:04.260,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes. We saw the authors it listed in the report. The two circumstances that the Law Commissioners were addressing were these. Firstly, when a foreign court had made no financial order at all, and secondly, where the foreign court had made a financial order, but that order was inadequate. And this appeal is concerned only with the second category. It is a condition precedent to the exercise of powers under Part 3 that the wife has to show in the circumstances of her case that a serious injustice has arisen. The serious injustice that this wife relies upon is that after a marriage of 32 years, which produced five children of the family and where the assets were around £700,000, the Nigerian court in June of 2005 awarded her a lump sum of £21,000 and a life interest in the house on Tin Can Island in Lagos. This very modest award produced a very significant disparity, or discrepancy, in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife was left in a position in which she did not own any one of the four properties in the case, two of which were in Lagos and two of which were in London. She was only left with a life interest in the property, that it ceased to be her main home in 1999, six years before the Nigerian court had made its order. In 1999, when the marriage broke down, she came to London to live at 27 Litton Road in New Barnet, a property which the husband had owned from 1975, and which had thereafter been used as a base for the family during the marriage. The trial judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, found that these parties had a long standing and enduring connection with this jurisdiction, and on the basis that the wife forfeited her life interest in the Tin Can Island property, in her husband's favour, he made the following order under Part 3. He ordered the Litton Road be sold and that the wife receives 65% of the net proceeds of sale, which was intended on the valuation used in the proceedings to give her about £275,000, which was to be used as follows. £225,000 to buy herself a modest flat in North London, and £50,000 as a cash sum to supplement her income when she is unable to work. The wife is now aged 69. The Court of Appeal allowed the husband's appeal and dismissed the order for financial provision in Toto. As a consequence, the wife would be homeless in this country where she has been a citizen since 1972, and where she has made her home and worked as a carer for the last 10 years. The purpose of Part 3 was to remit hardship arising from the order of a foreign court. Yet, the Court of Appeal have provided an outcome which Lord Justice Ward, who gave the lead judgement candidly admitted, has left the wife in a parlous plight. In making my submissions my lords and my lady, I want to address 5 topics. The first will be the policy issues considered by the Law Commissioners, which are material to this appeal. Secondly, the statutory provisions of part 3.

10	p1,00:44:19.790,00:46:30.340,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Section 13 is the filter process. It's the applicant having to apply to the High Court judge for leave to begin an application for financial relief, and in sub-paragraph one will see it reads. No application for an order for financial relief shall be made under this part of this Act, unless the leave of the court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court, and the court shall not grant leave unless it considers that there is a substantial ground for the making of an application for such an order. The subsections that follow are of some importance in this case. Subsection 2 is the one I mentioned earlier, which is statutory recognition for the fact that the court may make a Part 3 order, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order that provided for a payment or transfer of property to the applicant or a child of the family. That permits the dual application, and subsection 3 is also important, as will be developed in due course. Leave under this under this section may be granted subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit. This appeal does not really concern the Ex parte stage because, as your lordships and my lady will know, the husband appealed. Mr Justice Munby's decision not to set aside the Ex parte granted leave, and it was referred to Lord Justice Thorpe on paper who refused the application, and then there was an oral hearing in which my learned friend appeared before Lord Justice Warren Wilson, who dismissed the application and gave judgments. I don't want to spend too much time on this, although I would like to just briefly refer you to the leading case of Holmes because it is relevant to some extent, to our appeal.

And of course, this was one point where the Court of Appeal on the appeal against Mr Justice one be very gently pointed out in response to a point of mine, that Mr Justice had perhaps gone too far in his relation to a finding of hardship. Now that, we would say, was the clear illustration of a wider point.

10	p1,00:55:35.760,01:04:31.320,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes he is, I agree. If we could please, then turn to page 59. This is the short judgement of Lord Justice Russell, which is often quoted in these cases and indeed was quoted in this case by Mr Justice Munby, reading from the second sentence, the test in section 31 is in my judgement, plainly, a more stringent one, that's referring to judicial review. Prima facie, the order of the foreign court should prevail, save in exceptional circumstances, and a good case for any interference with it or adjustment of it or any supplementation of it should be apparent before any leave is granted under section 13, where the foreign court is properly seizing the dispute, as it was in this case. So far as it is possible, duplicity of proceedings should be avoided in this, as in all other fields and in the interests of the parties and their children, as well as in the interests of justice and the comity of nations. So he sees it as a strict test, a hard test, where there has been a foreign order. He's talking about exceptional circumstances, although the statute doesn't refer to that, and the and the Law Commission has actually said they did not want it to cover an exceptional case. But what is significant in my submission is the use of the word supplementation. Because what really happened here was that there was supplementation of the Nigerian order. And could we please look at Mr Justice Munby's judgement, again, it's in the bound volume. At appendix 1, page 47. It is paragraphs 59 and 60. This is how he dealt with the substantial ground test. At the end of the day, the real issue seems to me to be the same as it was when this case was first before me. To paraphrase what I said in my earlier judgement, is this in truth, simply a case where a wife is seeking to have a second bite of the cherry following proceedings in a foreign country which, although not satisfactory from her point of view and although not as generous from her point of view as comparable proceedings, would be in this country were nevertheless appropriately conducted and which led to a financial order in her favour, which can be and has been implemented? Or is it, on the other hand, a case where the circumstances are sufficiently exceptional, using the word in the sense in which it was used by Lord Justice Russell, that notwithstanding the making of a significant order in her favour by the foreign court, it is nonetheless proper to enable her to pursue a second application in this country. In my judgement, this case falls into the latter category. What is in my judgement, the very considerable discrepancy, indeed, between the aggregate value of what this court would consider to be the relevant matrimonial assets, some of the most valuable being located in this country, and the very modest amount of the provisions made for this wife following a marriage of, I emphasise 32 years, justifies the conclusion that there is within the meaning of section 31 of the Act, substantial ground for her making the application. If I deny her relief, she will suffer hardship, in my judgement, very serious hardship indeed, being faced in all probability with the unenviable choice of either remaining homeless in this country, where she is now based and where she wants to stay, or returning to Nigeria. And the test that he applied there was approved by the Court of Appeal when the husband's application for leave to appeal was dismissed. Part 3 proceedings have attracted the pejorative tag of being a second bite of the cherry, and that description implies that a Part 3 application is a complete rerun of the same proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction, and that what happens is that all the issues are canvassed again before a different judge in a different country with a different adjudication sort. But, my lord, we say that that is not the purpose of Part 3, and that is certainly not how it was envisaged it would be utilised by the Commissioners. We say that a Part 3 application should be case managed and directed to achieve the purpose of remitting the hardship that has been identified arising from the foreign financial order. And this is something that Mr Justice Munby addressed and dealt with, and he imposed, as he could do, as you remember under section 13(3), stringent conditions as to how the case was to be run at the final hearing. And if we could read on, please, to paragraph 61 of his judgement, I think you still have the page open, he says, so in principle, and despite everything said by Mr Mitchell, I accept that the wife should have leave to make her claim. In saying this, I have, of course, had regard to each and every one of the various factors referred to in section 16(2) of the Act, but this is subject to one very important qualification. There is, as it seems to me, very considerable force indeed, in Mr Mitchell's submission that the husband should not be exposed to the kind of extensive and no doubt expensive proceedings which the wife apparently has in mind. In my judgement, this is a case where it can be can now be seen, even if it was less obvious when the matter was first before me, that I should attach conditions, stringent conditions, to my grant of leave. I'm not prepared to contemplate a rerun of the Nigerian proceedings. I am not prepared to contemplate the reopening of factual issues which have been the subject of decision by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay. I am not prepared to contemplate a process involving extensive further evidence, questionnaires and disclosure, nor do I think there is any need for further evaluation or other evidence in relation to the conditional value of the various Nigerian properties. The court already has enough information on these topics to enable it to do proper justice in a fair and proportionate manner, not least bearing in mind that I propose also to impose a condition limiting the wife's property claims to the Barnett property, that's 27 Litton Road. By this, I mean a condition preventing the wife making any claim, whether a proprietary claim, or a claim for property adjustment, or a claim for any other form of transfer, or vesting of property order, to or in relation to any real property, whether in this country or in Nigeria. Saving except only for a claim for property adjustment border in relation to the Barnett property. This will not, however, prevent the wife pursuing her claims for a lump sum order and a payments order. I propose, therefore, to make an order dispensing with many of the normal steps in an ancillary relief, including directions designed to ensure that the wife substantive claim can come on for hearing as quickly, and as cheaply as possible. I am quite sure that full justice can be done to both parties at a hearing lasting no more than one day, and in which there is little if any oral evidence. And he also proposed in the final paragraph, as you can see for an appropriate order to be drawn up by counsel, and if necessary for there to be an informal financial dispute resolution hearing before him, to see whether the matter could be settled. And just in terms of that, within a fortnight of his judgement being handed down, the wife made an open offer on the fourth of January of 2007 to accept a transfer of Litton Road, on the basis of no order as to costs, and a clean break. And on the 31st of January of 2007, the husband rejected that proposal, making no counterproposal in reply, and he appealed to the Court of Appeal. So that is why the case took longer to be resolved than Mr Justice Munby had envisaged.
10	p3,00:04:24.040,00:04:55.920,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Although Mr Mitchell was not successful in setting aside the permission which had been granted, he was successful in restricting the end of the hearing which followed, and in persuading Mr Justice Munby to place severe restrictions on the way in which the wives came under part three could be pursued. So although on one view, his application was not successful. But he did, if I can put it this way, score a very important goal, and it therefore cannot be said that that application to set aside the permission which had been granted was misconceived or a waste of costs.
10	p1,01:05:19.390,01:06:36.010,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In paragraph 2, he granted leave, subject to the following conditions. There was a limitation on maintenance property adjustment, order only in relation to Litton Road, the lump sum, findings of fact by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay, identified in Annex to Stand, and then updating evidence not permitted, other than to deal with current income. And then income needs to be dealt with, and then over the page, no valuation evidence in respect of any property in Nigeria, and various directions for property values to be agreed. And then my lords you'll see over the page, page 18, various findings of fact made by the Nigerian judge, which were to stand in the Part 3 application, subject to the discretion of the trial judge in his consideration of the facts. So we say that those sorts of directions and that sort of case management should result in the case, not attracting the tag of being a second bite of the cherry.
10	p1,01:46:42.390,01:48:04.790,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes, he did. He did, as the Court of Appeal accepted. It was one of those cases where he obviously took the view that the litigation, as he said, had been going on for a very long time, and he wanted to give a judgement. I think he was on a Friday. He was going on circuit the following week and he wanted to wrap the matter up. He didn't want the parties being subjected to further litigation, especially as my client is obviously in receipt of public funding, and it was right that he gave his judgement there and then. And if the judgement isn't as detailed as, perhaps, it should be, the one really simple point to me, is that really nothing much has changed on the papers between when the case was before Mr Justice Munby and when Mr Justice Coleridge took over the case. There was a substantial body of affidavits, all the issues that were raised by my learned friend before Mr Justice Coleridge should all be in canvas before Mr Justice Munby. So there was nothing new in the case. Nothing in the evidence radically altered anything in the case at all. In fact, if anything, from the husbands perspective, the case became stronger for the wife because Mr Justice Coleridge accepted as the fact that she had lived here, really, for most of the time since 1999.
10	p2,00:55:59.440,00:58:30.740,spk_0,	True	Counsel: As the court knows, then the application for permission was made perfectly properly by learned friend Miss Harris to Mr Justice Mumby. An application was then made and conducted by my learned junior Mr Mitchell to set aside the permission which was given. And we have looked at Mr Justice Mumby's full judgment on that. It was at that point that I became involved in the case and I was asked to advise on the possibility of appealing against Mr Justice Munby's judgment. And I advise that an attempt should be made to appeal with hindsight, with the benefit of having read the hurt and now reread many times the judgments of the Court of Appeal. In this case, I accept fully that that was the wrong course to take. But I take responsibility for that. And I would pray in aid in mitigation, then it in at least one of the very few reported cases, namely Hewittson then and then an order for leave, which had been made, was overturned on appeal. And also I pray in aid that neither Mr Justice Mumby nor on appeal from his judgment, the Court of Appeal treated our approach in trying to set aside leave as one which was inherently undesirable, even though in the event we failed. But I do, except with hindsight, that the approach was not only wrong but that it was in the event counterproductive because what then happened was that Mr Justice Mumby having given a very full and characteristically erudite judgment which was then upheld by the Court of Appeal, where I made the further mistake of seeking to renew the application for leave to appeal orally. And so, although, as my learned friend has pointed out, Lord Justice Ward fell into error in conflating at one point the actual judgment Mr Justice Munby, of Mr Justice Coleridge and the point at which Mr Justice Coleridge was setting out the submissions put before him by counsel. But nevertheless, the general point which Lord Justice Ward was making that Mr Justice Coleridge fell into the trap of thinking that because these earlier judgments have dealt with a number of issues fully, he did not need to deal with them. That general point was a good point and was right. And is part of the reason, my lady going back to your question why Mr Justice Coleridge in this case fell into error.

10	p2,00:18:17.240,00:21:40.950,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Mr. Justice Munby said, in the first place I do not think that Mr Mitchell has made good his assertion that the discretion exercised by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay under section 72 of the Nigerian matrimonial causes that was anything like as broad as that which would be exercisable by an English judge under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. On the contrary, the powerful arguments marshalled by Miss Harris strongly suggests to me that it is nothing like so wide and that, at least in relation to Capitol vision, the Nigerian jurisdiction is not fundamentally needs base at all. So it would seem that the wife was driven to litigate in Nigeria if she was to litigate there at all on a narrower and less favourable basis, than would have been the case if she had been litigating in this country. And Lord Justice Wilson at page 56 a few pages on in the Court of Appeal at the hearing of Mr Barges application for permission to appeal against Mr Justice Munby, was of the same view in the middle of paragraph 17 on page 56, he said. However, the analysis of Mr Justice Munby in relation to the way in which that claim was rejected in Nigeria may well prove to be relevant. It is strongly arguable that the claim was not dispatched by redistributive principles at all, whatever their precise nature, but rather by reference to principles, actual ownership to which we were in this jurisdiction were confined prior to the reforms introduced in 1971. Mr Scott submits that such a conclusion cannot be made even on a provisional basis without expert evidence as to the principles of Nigerian law which must have lain behind the Nigerian judge's rejection of the claim. With respect, I reject that submission. In my view, Mr Justice, Munby's recital of the way in which counsel's arguments in Nigeria were cast and the way in which the judge in Nigeria articulated her rejection of the wife's claim enables one provisionally to reach that conclusion. If such a conclusion is valid or arguably valid, then the comments made by Lord Justice Thorpe in Jordan, which the judge cited are in point. It may be that the failure of the wife to achieve transfer of that property in the Nigerian court was a result of the application of principles in no way comparable to those by reference to which we would dispatch such a claim. And in in his printed case, my learned friend has said that the English court made orders similar to the sort of order the Nigerian court made before the changes came in 1971 and that significant disparity between husband and wife in terms of their financial positions after an English ancillary relief order were not uncommon in the past, we submit that those arguments really are merely an exercise in in retrospection, arguing that the wife's award that she obtained in Nigeria would not be out of place in the 1960's is not a constructive way to approach this appeal. Family law, perhaps more than any other branch of the law, has to evolve to meet changing social mores and expectations. In the case of part three, we have the increasing mobility of people around the world over the last 20 years. 
10	p1,01:44:08.290,01:45:35.300,spk_2,	True	Counsel: It's very difficult to do that, to value the life interest. See my lord, looking at the disparity here, we say that Mr Justice Coleridge was right to adopt Mr Justice Munby's wrong judgement and to proceed on the basis, in making the substantive order, that the Nigerian ward was inadequate, and that the substantial disparity between the parties justified a further order being made by the English court because he could see and indeed so he found that the wife was going to suffer severe financial hardship if she was going to remain living in this country with an award provided for by the Nigerian court. Mr Justice Coleridge receives quite a lot of criticism from Lord Justice Ward about the fact that he relied upon Mr Justice Munby's judgement, which was a long judgement running to 64 paragraphs, and Lord Justice Lamer in the Court of Appeal, also said, well, the parties will hardly go to thank Mr Justice Coleridge if he was going to descend into the amount of detail again that Mr Justice Munby had embarked on and indeed, the Court of Appeal had embarked on.

Mr. Justice Munby, which had been upheld by the Court of Appeal which was in reality directed or should have been directed to purely to section 13 with section 16 only coming in by a side wind.

But as the Court of Appeal pointed out, both on the appeal from Mr Justice Munby and in the appeal from which Maloney friends appeal comes before this court today, that is, in fact, a different exercise. And it was incumbent on the judge hearing the substantive application to start again de Novo and to put out of his mind any of those aspects of the Section 13 application for permission, which did not relate directly to Section 16. And indeed, it was the duty of Mr Justice Coleridge. And he was invited, more or less directed to do so by Lords Justices Warren Wilson to approach the matter de Novo and to hear the arguments de novo so it would have been inappropriate even leaving aside the technical difficulties of absence of evidence. But it would have been inappropriate for Mr Justice Munby at that stage to adopt the approach which Your Lordship canvases because the judge hearing the substantive application is conducting a separate exercise in which Section 16 and if the applicant gets past that section 18 are the relevant sections, whereas on the application for permission. It is section 13 informed to some extent by section 16, by taking other matters into account which the court is having to consider.

11	p1,00:21:54.940,00:27:06.170,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In our view, the advantage of giving a remedy needs to be very carefully balanced, not only against the risks of forum shopping. That is the risk that litigants with little or no real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that to confer such a power on the courts could, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply, to the incidence of a particular marriage, pose problems which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to resolve. Where we don't need to be concerned about the applicable law in the case because English law is applied, and in Scotland, Scots Law is applied. In order to meet their concerns about forum shopping, the Law Commissioners proposed three specific safeguards. The first, where jurisdictional requirements based on those four divorce proceedings. They considered that the party should, or either of the party should be domiciled in England and Wales, at the time the application was made, or when the foreign divorce order was made or alternatively, either of the parties could be habitually resident in this jurisdiction for a period of 12 months, either before the application was made or the foreign divorce took effect. There is also another basis for jurisdiction, which doesn't apply in this case but I'll mention it anyway, because the wife could have come within this provision had she wanted to. And that provision is that if either of the parties had a beneficial interest in a property that had been a matrimonial home in this jurisdiction, if you invoke that limb of jurisdiction, then the claimant is restricted to the amount of the beneficial interest. In other words, you can't get more than the beneficial interest that's owned by the other spouse. The second safeguard, to guard against forum shopping, was a filter process in the form of an Ex parte application before a High Court judge, for leave to bring the Part 3 application. The purpose of that was obviously to filter out unmeritorious applications before the other spouse was involved in the proceedings. The third safeguard was consideration by the judge of what the Commissioner's described as some specific guidelines, which we will see in due course, because these guidelines became incorporated in section 16, which is the main statutory provisions that we're concerned with in this case. And those guidelines were to assist the court in the exercise of its discretion to determine whether it was appropriate for the English court to make an order, and these guidelines, as we shall see, focus on connection to this jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction in which the foreign divorce was made, and then on financial matters arising in the jurisdictions. There was no issue in this case at any stage about jurisdiction. The wife based her application on her habitual residents here. Of some significance we say, in this case, is the fact that the wife was acquitted of forum shopping. The very feature of the reforms that the Law Commissioners were concerned about. Mr Justice Munby, who dealt with the Ex parte application and then the inter-parties application brought by the husband to set aside the granted leave. On the papers before him, acquitted the wife of forum shopping. If I could ask you please to turn to the bound volume and appendix 1, what I'd like to refer you please to page 45, which is his judgement. It's page 45, paragraph 58, towards the bottom of the page.

Not least of all, of course, the Court of Appeals judgement in this case, concerned about procedure, and if you want any assistance on that, I do have some views as a practitioner. It may or may not be helpful. If I could ask you please to look at the authorities bundle 1, the same bundle in which the report is found and to look at tab 5. This is the case of Holmes, which is one of the leading cases and in fact, was the first case that the Court of Appeal considered in relation not to the substantive order but in relation to whether the [inaudible] should be set aside. And if I could ask you, please, to turn to page 53 of the report, in the judgement of Lord Justice Purchas, he dealt with the phrase 'substantial ground', and what he said has really been the test, the basis that has been applied in subsequent cases. It's just below E on page 53, he said the phrase 'substantial ground' for the making of an application for such an order is clearly central to the issues in this application. Looking at that expression in the immediate context of the Act, I have formed the view that what is required is that the applicants should demonstrate to the court that there is in all the circumstances surrounding the application for financial relief, the orders that may or may not have been made, the presence or absence of powers to grant financial relief in the foreign forum, reasons for saying that there is a substantial ground for making an application. That is a substantial ground upon which the court could be invited to exercise its powers under section 12, within the jurisdiction of section 15. In particular, when the court comes to consider such an application, it will have to take into account under section 16(1), whether in all the circumstances of the case, it would be appropriate for such an order to be made by a court in England and Wales. If it is not satisfied that it would be appropriate, and that is a positive onus, the court shall, as a matter of mandatory instruction, dismiss the application.

It's the applicant having to apply to the High Court judge for leave to begin an application for financial relief, and in sub-paragraph one will see it reads. No application for an order for financial relief shall be made under this part of this Act, unless the leave of the court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court, and the court shall not grant leave unless it considers that there is a substantial ground for the making of an application for such an order. The subsections that follow are of some importance in this case. Subsection 2 is the one I mentioned earlier, which is statutory recognition for the fact that the court may make a Part 3 order, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order that provided for a payment or transfer of property to the applicant or a child of the family. That permits the dual application, and subsection 3 is also important, as will be developed in due course. Leave under this under this section may be granted subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit. This appeal does not really concern the Ex parte stage because, as your lordships and my lady will know, the husband appealed. Mr Justice Munby's decision not to set aside the Ex parte granted leave, and it was referred to Lord Justice Thorpe on paper who refused the application, and then there was an oral hearing in which my learned friend appeared before Lord Justice Warren Wilson, who dismissed the application and gave judgments. I don't want to spend too much time on this, although I would like to just briefly refer you to the leading case of Holmes because it is relevant to some extent, to our appeal.

Not least of all, of course, the Court of Appeals judgement in this case, concerned about procedure, and if you want any assistance on that, I do have some views as a practitioner. It may or may not be helpful. If I could ask you please to look at the authorities bundle 1, the same bundle in which the report is found and to look at tab 5. This is the case of Holmes, which is one of the leading cases and in fact, was the first case that the Court of Appeal considered in relation not to the substantive order but in relation to whether the [inaudible] should be set aside. And if I could ask you, please, to turn to page 53 of the report, in the judgement of Lord Justice Purchas, he dealt with the phrase 'substantial ground', and what he said has really been the test, the basis that has been applied in subsequent cases. It's just below E on page 53, he said the phrase 'substantial ground' for the making of an application for such an order is clearly central to the issues in this application. Looking at that expression in the immediate context of the Act, I have formed the view that what is required is that the applicants should demonstrate to the court that there is in all the circumstances surrounding the application for financial relief, the orders that may or may not have been made, the presence or absence of powers to grant financial relief in the foreign forum, reasons for saying that there is a substantial ground for making an application.

12	p2,01:53:57.150,01:56:05.070,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And then over the page at paragraph 51 Yeah. Having rejected proposals for a rigid bar and applications, we are left with the alternative of a flexible discretion under which, although an application could be presented by any person able to satisfy the jurisdictional test, we have recommended such applications would be the subject of preliminary scrutiny by the court, which would only allow the applicant to proceed if in the circumstances it was thought appropriate to do so in the general formulation of the proposed discretion. And we think that it should be made clear by express statutory provisions that the object of the discretion is to provide for the occasional hard case now pausing there. The statute does not use the phrase occasional hard case or any other equivalent phrase, but by way of guidance as to how the powers conferred by the statute should be exercised. This could not be plainer and the fact that Parliament has not actually included, and it would be somewhat unusual to find words even equivalent to the occasional hard case in a Westminster statute. But this shows just how narrow the mischief was. Just how small is the category of cases in which part three orders should be made and then the test. We consider, therefore, that the court should be given power to entertain an application for a financial provisional property adjustment order notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce if in the light of all the circumstances of the case and in particular certain specified circumstances, the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise. Now again, there is no reference in the statute to serious injustice. But we invite this court to approach the fundamental question raised by the appeal on the basis that the mischief at which the statute was directed was the very narrow one. It was directed at the occasional hard case where serious injustice might arise.
12	p1,00:10:27.300,00:20:34.350,spk_2,	True	Counsel: They pose the specific question. Should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? The difficulties in the way of reform of the law are thus formidable. They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied for financial relief in the country where the divorce was granted, but either failed to do so or did so, but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate. Correspondingly, the difficulties are least acute in cases where the law of the country where the divorce was granted contained no provision for financially relief in favour of the wife. We think there is little doubt that a wife who is thus unable to obtain any financial relief, should, provided she can establish a sufficient link between the marriage and this country, be eligible to apply for a financial order here. But we have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court to hear applications for financial relief, notwithstanding the existence of a prior foreign decree of divorce, should be exercisable only in such cases and not in cases where the foreign court had made, or could have made a financial order. We are, however, in no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one with which the marriage has much real connection, but there are also subsidiary arguments which seemed to us to support the view that a restriction of this kind would be undesirable. First, injustice could occur if the foreign divorce court, having dealt with part of a wife's claim for financial relief, could not or would not make any order in relation to capital assets in England, and the English court were precluded from making any order because of the foreign court's order. And my lords and my lady, we say that that really strikes at the very heart of this appeal because in the Nigerian court, the position was that they could not make an order to transfer Litton Road to the wife, and nor would they make any order for her to have a settlement of that property either. And as you will see when we go on to look at the statute, the Law Commissioner's view that there should be no restriction was actually enshrined in the statute, specifically in section 13(2), where the statute says that you can make an application, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order for financial provision. The foundation of Part 3 was based on the Law Commissioner's view that a foreign court which had granted the divorce was not necessarily the only court to deal with all issues arising from the divorce, and they came to this decision for for two reasons. First, they recognise the increasing international mobility, which meant that a marriage and the spouses can have connections with more than one jurisdiction and one legal system. Where they married, where they are domiciles, where they are nationals, and where they have lived during the marriage, pre and post separation, and where their assets are located, give them a connection with more than one jurisdiction. And if I could ask you, please, to look at paragraph 27 which is the preceding paragraph to the one that I just referred to, and just starting from the second sentence, it reads. In a world of pure legal analysis, it would no doubt be possible to identify a single system of law with which the marriage was more closely connected than any other. That system could then be regarded as the proper law of the marriage. As such, it would govern the marriage and its consequences. We do not, however, think that this aim can in practise, be achieved at a time when people can travel easily from one country to another. Marriages are increasingly connected with several different systems of law, for example, with the law of the party's nationality or the law of their place of residence, the place where the marriage was celebrated, or even with the law of their religion. In our view, it is unrealistic to suppose that a process of juristic analysis will identify any single right system of law to which all questions relevant to a particular marriage should be referred to the exclusion of all other systems. In this particular case, although it is right to say that during the marriage the parties spent most of their married life in Nigeria, they have a longstanding and enduring connection with this country. This case is a very good example, we say, of the sort of category of case that the Law Commissioners were considering in paragraph 27. There is no right or obvious jurisdiction to resolve all matters that arise in this case, and it's interesting perhaps, to make the point that both parties had jurisdiction to issue a petition for divorce in Nigeria, and in England. That shows the the connection. It is difficult when you look at the background to the case, which I'll come to a bit in more detail in the moment, it's difficult to identify any aspect of the party's lives that did not have a connection with England, from the very beginning. They met here, married here, and the husband still owns two properties here. They are dual nationals, and perhaps the most striking feature of the case, from a financial point of view, is that 75% of the parties' wealth is not in Nigeria, but it's in England. The second reason for the Law Commission as rejecting the principle that only one court should decide all financial matters consequent on divorce, was that the commissioners recognised that an injustice could arise when the foreign court had made an order which was inadequate and produced a serious injustice. This inadequacy could arise in a number of different ways. First, the foreign court might not have extensive powers to make financial orders. It might be only able to make orders for maintenance, as opposed to orders for lump sum or, as we have in this country, property adjustment. Secondly, the foreign court might not have the power to make orders in respect of property, especially immovable property outside its territorial jurisdiction. This meant that a property in England would be outside the ambit, or could be outside the ambit of a foreign order. And also lastly, of significance in this particular case, is that foreign courts do not necessarily have the range of orders that courts can exercise in this country. The range of orders might be very limited, as was the position here where the Nigerian court, it is common ground, only has power to order a settlement of property and not an order for property adjustment, which transfers the ownership of property from one spouse to another. Also underlying the Act was the Law Commissioner's concern about the financial burden that could be thrust on the public purse, if the effect of the foreign order made inadequate provision, and that is referred to not only in the report but also in the working paper. If I could just ask you please to turn back in tab 1 to page 2, it's the second page of the Commissioner's report. They were dealing with a situation where no order had been made by the foreign court. I'm just reading four lines down from the top of page 2. Such a woman may thus face destitution, and her only source of financial support may be supplementary benefit, and if benefit is paid to her, the supplementary benefits authorities will have no legal right to recover the sums paid from the husband, since he will no longer be a 'liable' relative. The fact that the husband lives in this country and has substantial assets here makes no difference to the legal position. And that concern about being a drain on the public part is also a factor in this case because as a result of the Court of Appeal decision, the wife has been deprived of the means to provide a modest property for herself. And if she wants to remain living in London, where she has lived for the last 10 years, she will have to apply for local authority housing, and I will develop this point in due course.

12	p1,00:55:35.760,01:04:31.320,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes he is, I agree. If we could please, then turn to page 59. This is the short judgement of Lord Justice Russell, which is often quoted in these cases and indeed was quoted in this case by Mr Justice Munby, reading from the second sentence, the test in section 31 is in my judgement, plainly, a more stringent one, that's referring to judicial review. Prima facie, the order of the foreign court should prevail, save in exceptional circumstances, and a good case for any interference with it or adjustment of it or any supplementation of it should be apparent before any leave is granted under section 13, where the foreign court is properly seizing the dispute, as it was in this case. So far as it is possible, duplicity of proceedings should be avoided in this, as in all other fields and in the interests of the parties and their children, as well as in the interests of justice and the comity of nations. So he sees it as a strict test, a hard test, where there has been a foreign order. He's talking about exceptional circumstances, although the statute doesn't refer to that, and the and the Law Commission has actually said they did not want it to cover an exceptional case. But what is significant in my submission is the use of the word supplementation. Because what really happened here was that there was supplementation of the Nigerian order. And could we please look at Mr Justice Munby's judgement, again, it's in the bound volume. At appendix 1, page 47. It is paragraphs 59 and 60. This is how he dealt with the substantial ground test. At the end of the day, the real issue seems to me to be the same as it was when this case was first before me. To paraphrase what I said in my earlier judgement, is this in truth, simply a case where a wife is seeking to have a second bite of the cherry following proceedings in a foreign country which, although not satisfactory from her point of view and although not as generous from her point of view as comparable proceedings, would be in this country were nevertheless appropriately conducted and which led to a financial order in her favour, which can be and has been implemented? Or is it, on the other hand, a case where the circumstances are sufficiently exceptional, using the word in the sense in which it was used by Lord Justice Russell, that notwithstanding the making of a significant order in her favour by the foreign court, it is nonetheless proper to enable her to pursue a second application in this country. In my judgement, this case falls into the latter category. What is in my judgement, the very considerable discrepancy, indeed, between the aggregate value of what this court would consider to be the relevant matrimonial assets, some of the most valuable being located in this country, and the very modest amount of the provisions made for this wife following a marriage of, I emphasise 32 years, justifies the conclusion that there is within the meaning of section 31 of the Act, substantial ground for her making the application. If I deny her relief, she will suffer hardship, in my judgement, very serious hardship indeed, being faced in all probability with the unenviable choice of either remaining homeless in this country, where she is now based and where she wants to stay, or returning to Nigeria. And the test that he applied there was approved by the Court of Appeal when the husband's application for leave to appeal was dismissed. Part 3 proceedings have attracted the pejorative tag of being a second bite of the cherry, and that description implies that a Part 3 application is a complete rerun of the same proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction, and that what happens is that all the issues are canvassed again before a different judge in a different country with a different adjudication sort. But, my lord, we say that that is not the purpose of Part 3, and that is certainly not how it was envisaged it would be utilised by the Commissioners. We say that a Part 3 application should be case managed and directed to achieve the purpose of remitting the hardship that has been identified arising from the foreign financial order. And this is something that Mr Justice Munby addressed and dealt with, and he imposed, as he could do, as you remember under section 13(3), stringent conditions as to how the case was to be run at the final hearing. And if we could read on, please, to paragraph 61 of his judgement, I think you still have the page open, he says, so in principle, and despite everything said by Mr Mitchell, I accept that the wife should have leave to make her claim. In saying this, I have, of course, had regard to each and every one of the various factors referred to in section 16(2) of the Act, but this is subject to one very important qualification. There is, as it seems to me, very considerable force indeed, in Mr Mitchell's submission that the husband should not be exposed to the kind of extensive and no doubt expensive proceedings which the wife apparently has in mind. In my judgement, this is a case where it can be can now be seen, even if it was less obvious when the matter was first before me, that I should attach conditions, stringent conditions, to my grant of leave. I'm not prepared to contemplate a rerun of the Nigerian proceedings. I am not prepared to contemplate the reopening of factual issues which have been the subject of decision by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay. I am not prepared to contemplate a process involving extensive further evidence, questionnaires and disclosure, nor do I think there is any need for further evaluation or other evidence in relation to the conditional value of the various Nigerian properties. The court already has enough information on these topics to enable it to do proper justice in a fair and proportionate manner, not least bearing in mind that I propose also to impose a condition limiting the wife's property claims to the Barnett property, that's 27 Litton Road. By this, I mean a condition preventing the wife making any claim, whether a proprietary claim, or a claim for property adjustment, or a claim for any other form of transfer, or vesting of property order, to or in relation to any real property, whether in this country or in Nigeria. Saving except only for a claim for property adjustment border in relation to the Barnett property. This will not, however, prevent the wife pursuing her claims for a lump sum order and a payments order. I propose, therefore, to make an order dispensing with many of the normal steps in an ancillary relief, including directions designed to ensure that the wife substantive claim can come on for hearing as quickly, and as cheaply as possible. I am quite sure that full justice can be done to both parties at a hearing lasting no more than one day, and in which there is little if any oral evidence. And he also proposed in the final paragraph, as you can see for an appropriate order to be drawn up by counsel, and if necessary for there to be an informal financial dispute resolution hearing before him, to see whether the matter could be settled. And just in terms of that, within a fortnight of his judgement being handed down, the wife made an open offer on the fourth of January of 2007 to accept a transfer of Litton Road, on the basis of no order as to costs, and a clean break. And on the 31st of January of 2007, the husband rejected that proposal, making no counterproposal in reply, and he appealed to the Court of Appeal. So that is why the case took longer to be resolved than Mr Justice Munby had envisaged.

Um, but when it's justice, Coleridge addressed the threshold question. The battleground seems to have been on whether the wife was genuine in saying, but she had a desire to live in England. English connections is all bona fide, or whether the husband's right in saying this is all a blatant forum shopping. The only reason she's come to England is to shop. We don't find any reference in Mr Justice Coleridge's judgment to questions of hardship or getting over that threshold.

I agree with him.
12	p1,01:08:40.670,01:10:05.740,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Her case was on the basis of, I'll specifically come to this in a moment, but the judge approached the case on the basis that the order he make would only be to remit the hardship, and he followed an earlier decision at first instance to that effect. So although it was a general ancillary relief claim, it was targeted at meeting her needs for accommodation, namely, having a transfer of Litton Road, and this is an important matter in the case because again, whether or not it's a second bite of the cherry, we say that if a prior financial order has been made, not only should the judge case manage the case, but he should direct the order when he makes the substantive order to the hardship. In other words, he doesn't just look at the matters of fresh and come up with an English order in a conventional way. And Mr Justice Coleridge as we will see, deliberately said, I am not making an order in the same quantum as I would have done had I been dealing with the matter in a conventional ancillary relief case, he gave her less, and he said so. Can I now turn please to Section 16 of the Act, which is the main section on the consideration in the appeal.

We are not basing our case, and nor has the wife's case ever been based on a disparity between the order that was made in Nigeria and the outcome that would have been achieved had the matter been litigated here de Novo. We're not saying the disparity is that the wife should have had half and she didn't get half. The disparity that we that we are pointing to is indeed Mr Justice Mommy did. At the very answer to the case is the disparity between what the husband receives and what the wife receives. Whereas when the court of appeal looked at disparity, they were looking at the disparity between the Nigerian Order and the English Order had been made, which was not our case. If I could ask you please to look at the judgment of Lord Justice Ward at page 105.

13	p3,01:26:54.170,01:29:25.850,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And it is much more appropriate and certainly in line with comity for the English Court to look at a foreign order, where such an order has been made and to consider whether serious injustice will result. Now it may be that the -- I don't accept that the introduction of foreign [inaudible] principles is entirely outside the Law Commission report or, indeed, that it's outside the statute because Section 16(2)(a) and (b) plainly do require a degree of comparison between the jurisdictions, which itself imports to some extent [inaudible] principles. And so in those circumstances, the court has to consider, we suggest, whether the foreign order has resulted in an objective sense in serious injustice. And I say in an objective sense, because of course, as has been said in many cases, what is fair for one party will almost inevitably seem unfair to the other. And so the court has to stand back and look at it objectively. But that objective overview has to be taken according to the appropriate lens or prism, and if the case is in a wider sense, an English case through and through, then the English court is more likely to find that the foreign order is objectively unjust. If the case is very substantially a Nigerian case, which this case was found to be both by the English and the Nigerian courts, then the English court should approach the question of serious injustice through the Nigerian lens, in which case there is no ground for any criticism because we have seen how the Nigerian court approached it. There is no criticism of the fairness of the procedure, the outcome, although no doubt disappointing for the wife was -- the court may think well within the bracket of what might be expected in the way in which she [inaudible] and the way in which she put her case. And very importantly, she did not appeal it. So it is, we suggest, in the context of this case, the purest forum shopping to come to the English court, having tried to [inaudible].

In fact, as you would have seen from the Justice Coleridge, there is criticism about whether the procedure is working effectively or not. At page 65 please, in Mr Justice Coleridge's judgement, and if I could ask you please to look at the the top of the page, the second paragraph, Mr Justice Coleridge said the husband's cases as to section 16 is that the parties connection with this country has really subsisted since separation. Mr Scott asked why the husband should be responsible for the wife's choice to live here, at very considerable extra cost. He says this would be grossly unfair on the husband whose own case stroke evidence was that he himself could not afford to reside here. Mr Scott does not shrink from accusing the wife of blatant forum shopping, crawling the globe to obtain a favourable order, and says that this is no more and no less than an appeal from the Nigerian court. He says that it is not appropriate for this court to start meddling in matters already litigated in Nigeria. That this is a black and white case in which the wife should be stopped. If I could ask you please to go down to the bottom of the page, just picking up the the thread of that argument, he says, the parties have a longstanding and real connection with the UK, its culture, and way of life. They are British citizens, all the children are British and were born here. The wife is unquestionably resident here and has strong connections here. She would say that she has been so for a very long time. There are issues as to when the wife came here for the long term, and I have been shown a schedule based on her passport, which I accept. I also accept the wife has spent the vast majority of her time here in the period from 1999 to 2005, she has been in this country now for nearly 10 years. Apart from that, the parties bought two properties here, one in 1975 and one in 2002. The children were all educated here as a result of which they themselves have property here. It was apparent also that each of the children spent at least part of their time here and regarding England as an important part of their lives.

Yes, quite. So my lord, we would say, bearing in mind the the judgements that had preceded him, he was entitled to find that the Nigerian award was inadequate and he was entitled to find that the wife had suffered, or will suffer serious hardship, and he was also entitled to find, as he said, that the parties have a longstanding and real connection with the UK, its culture and way of life.

So this is not somebody who has even exhausted her remedies in Nigeria before making this application, she gets an order in Nigeria which corresponds, as we shall see not too far to what she was seeking. And then within weeks, rather than appeal that and test the limits of the Nigerian jurisdiction starts her application here. And so I do not reside I'll, although this hasn't found favour in any of the various courts, which I've addressed the point. But I do not resolve from the proposition that his wife has been forum shopping and this application has been an exercise in form shopping.

He said in my judgment, it would be wrong to focus simply upon a comparison between what the wife was awarded in Nigeria and what she would have been awarded had she been able to proceed with her answer relief claims in this jurisdiction. Well, that was never our submission. London is properly perceived to be the divorce capital of the world because wives generally do much better here than elsewhere. If mere disparity, even quite significant disparity in the awards becomes the principal criterion for the exercise of the Section 16 discretion, what was supposed to be the exception will soon become the rule is disaffected wise, flee the less generous jurisdiction and set up home here in order to embrace our notions of fair distribution of resources on divorce. As I pointed out at paragraph 36 above, the law commission was reluctant to expose our courts to the problems arising from the applicant, failing to get a larger reward than she wanted or expected. Whilst therefore, disparity is an obvious factor to which to have regard, it should not be permitted to dominate.. You know what it was? It was obviously a factor that we said was relevant to the Section 13 test, but it was incorporated by them as a matter within the Section 16 consideration of the facts.

13	p1,00:55:35.760,01:04:31.320,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes he is, I agree. If we could please, then turn to page 59. This is the short judgement of Lord Justice Russell, which is often quoted in these cases and indeed was quoted in this case by Mr Justice Munby, reading from the second sentence, the test in section 31 is in my judgement, plainly, a more stringent one, that's referring to judicial review. Prima facie, the order of the foreign court should prevail, save in exceptional circumstances, and a good case for any interference with it or adjustment of it or any supplementation of it should be apparent before any leave is granted under section 13, where the foreign court is properly seizing the dispute, as it was in this case. So far as it is possible, duplicity of proceedings should be avoided in this, as in all other fields and in the interests of the parties and their children, as well as in the interests of justice and the comity of nations. So he sees it as a strict test, a hard test, where there has been a foreign order. He's talking about exceptional circumstances, although the statute doesn't refer to that, and the and the Law Commission has actually said they did not want it to cover an exceptional case. But what is significant in my submission is the use of the word supplementation. Because what really happened here was that there was supplementation of the Nigerian order. And could we please look at Mr Justice Munby's judgement, again, it's in the bound volume. At appendix 1, page 47. It is paragraphs 59 and 60. This is how he dealt with the substantial ground test. At the end of the day, the real issue seems to me to be the same as it was when this case was first before me. To paraphrase what I said in my earlier judgement, is this in truth, simply a case where a wife is seeking to have a second bite of the cherry following proceedings in a foreign country which, although not satisfactory from her point of view and although not as generous from her point of view as comparable proceedings, would be in this country were nevertheless appropriately conducted and which led to a financial order in her favour, which can be and has been implemented? Or is it, on the other hand, a case where the circumstances are sufficiently exceptional, using the word in the sense in which it was used by Lord Justice Russell, that notwithstanding the making of a significant order in her favour by the foreign court, it is nonetheless proper to enable her to pursue a second application in this country. In my judgement, this case falls into the latter category. What is in my judgement, the very considerable discrepancy, indeed, between the aggregate value of what this court would consider to be the relevant matrimonial assets, some of the most valuable being located in this country, and the very modest amount of the provisions made for this wife following a marriage of, I emphasise 32 years, justifies the conclusion that there is within the meaning of section 31 of the Act, substantial ground for her making the application. If I deny her relief, she will suffer hardship, in my judgement, very serious hardship indeed, being faced in all probability with the unenviable choice of either remaining homeless in this country, where she is now based and where she wants to stay, or returning to Nigeria. And the test that he applied there was approved by the Court of Appeal when the husband's application for leave to appeal was dismissed. Part 3 proceedings have attracted the pejorative tag of being a second bite of the cherry, and that description implies that a Part 3 application is a complete rerun of the same proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction, and that what happens is that all the issues are canvassed again before a different judge in a different country with a different adjudication sort. But, my lord, we say that that is not the purpose of Part 3, and that is certainly not how it was envisaged it would be utilised by the Commissioners. We say that a Part 3 application should be case managed and directed to achieve the purpose of remitting the hardship that has been identified arising from the foreign financial order. And this is something that Mr Justice Munby addressed and dealt with, and he imposed, as he could do, as you remember under section 13(3), stringent conditions as to how the case was to be run at the final hearing. And if we could read on, please, to paragraph 61 of his judgement, I think you still have the page open, he says, so in principle, and despite everything said by Mr Mitchell, I accept that the wife should have leave to make her claim. In saying this, I have, of course, had regard to each and every one of the various factors referred to in section 16(2) of the Act, but this is subject to one very important qualification. There is, as it seems to me, very considerable force indeed, in Mr Mitchell's submission that the husband should not be exposed to the kind of extensive and no doubt expensive proceedings which the wife apparently has in mind. In my judgement, this is a case where it can be can now be seen, even if it was less obvious when the matter was first before me, that I should attach conditions, stringent conditions, to my grant of leave. I'm not prepared to contemplate a rerun of the Nigerian proceedings. I am not prepared to contemplate the reopening of factual issues which have been the subject of decision by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay. I am not prepared to contemplate a process involving extensive further evidence, questionnaires and disclosure, nor do I think there is any need for further evaluation or other evidence in relation to the conditional value of the various Nigerian properties. The court already has enough information on these topics to enable it to do proper justice in a fair and proportionate manner, not least bearing in mind that I propose also to impose a condition limiting the wife's property claims to the Barnett property, that's 27 Litton Road. By this, I mean a condition preventing the wife making any claim, whether a proprietary claim, or a claim for property adjustment, or a claim for any other form of transfer, or vesting of property order, to or in relation to any real property, whether in this country or in Nigeria. Saving except only for a claim for property adjustment border in relation to the Barnett property. This will not, however, prevent the wife pursuing her claims for a lump sum order and a payments order. I propose, therefore, to make an order dispensing with many of the normal steps in an ancillary relief, including directions designed to ensure that the wife substantive claim can come on for hearing as quickly, and as cheaply as possible. I am quite sure that full justice can be done to both parties at a hearing lasting no more than one day, and in which there is little if any oral evidence. And he also proposed in the final paragraph, as you can see for an appropriate order to be drawn up by counsel, and if necessary for there to be an informal financial dispute resolution hearing before him, to see whether the matter could be settled. And just in terms of that, within a fortnight of his judgement being handed down, the wife made an open offer on the fourth of January of 2007 to accept a transfer of Litton Road, on the basis of no order as to costs, and a clean break. And on the 31st of January of 2007, the husband rejected that proposal, making no counterproposal in reply, and he appealed to the Court of Appeal. So that is why the case took longer to be resolved than Mr Justice Munby had envisaged.

13	p1,01:44:08.290,01:45:35.300,spk_2,	True	Counsel: It's very difficult to do that, to value the life interest. See my lord, looking at the disparity here, we say that Mr Justice Coleridge was right to adopt Mr Justice Munby's wrong judgement and to proceed on the basis, in making the substantive order, that the Nigerian ward was inadequate, and that the substantial disparity between the parties justified a further order being made by the English court because he could see and indeed so he found that the wife was going to suffer severe financial hardship if she was going to remain living in this country with an award provided for by the Nigerian court. Mr Justice Coleridge receives quite a lot of criticism from Lord Justice Ward about the fact that he relied upon Mr Justice Munby's judgement, which was a long judgement running to 64 paragraphs, and Lord Justice Lamer in the Court of Appeal, also said, well, the parties will hardly go to thank Mr Justice Coleridge if he was going to descend into the amount of detail again that Mr. Justice Munby had embarked on and indeed, the Court of Appeal had embarked on.
13	p1,00:02:06.220,00:06:04.260,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes. We saw the authors it listed in the report. The two circumstances that the Law Commissioners were addressing were these. Firstly, when a foreign court had made no financial order at all, and secondly, where the foreign court had made a financial order, but that order was inadequate. And this appeal is concerned only with the second category. It is a condition precedent to the exercise of powers under Part 3 that the wife has to show in the circumstances of her case that a serious injustice has arisen. The serious injustice that this wife relies upon is that after a marriage of 32 years, which produced five children of the family and where the assets were around £700,000, the Nigerian court in June of 2005 awarded her a lump sum of £21,000 and a life interest in the house on Tin Can Island in Lagos. This very modest award produced a very significant disparity, or discrepancy, in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife was left in a position in which she did not own any one of the four properties in the case, two of which were in Lagos and two of which were in London. She was only left with a life interest in the property, that it ceased to be her main home in 1999, six years before the Nigerian court had made its order. In 1999, when the marriage broke down, she came to London to live at 27 Litton Road in New Barnet, a property which the husband had owned from 1975, and which had thereafter been used as a base for the family during the marriage. The trial judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, found that these parties had a long standing and enduring connection with this jurisdiction, and on the basis that the wife forfeited her life interest in the Tin Can Island property, in her husband's favour, he made the following order under Part 3. He ordered the Litton Road be sold and that the wife receives 65% of the net proceeds of sale, which was intended on the valuation used in the proceedings to give her about £275,000, which was to be used as follows. £225,000 to buy herself a modest flat in North London, and £50,000 as a cash sum to supplement her income when she is unable to work. The wife is now aged 69. The Court of Appeal allowed the husband's appeal and dismissed the order for financial provision in Toto. As a consequence, the wife would be homeless in this country where she has been a citizen since 1972, and where she has made her home and worked as a carer for the last 10 years. The purpose of Part 3 was to remit hardship arising from the order of a foreign court. Yet, the Court of Appeal have provided an outcome which Lord Justice Ward, who gave the lead judgement candidly admitted, has left the wife in a parlous plight. In making my submissions my lords and my lady, I want to address 5 topics. The first will be the policy issues considered by the Law Commissioners, which are material to this appeal. Secondly, the statutory provisions of part 3.

14	p2,01:40:33.310,01:41:15.890,spk_0,	True	Counsel: No, it can't. But one has to look at the circumstances in which the Section 16 spells out. One has to look at the circumstances in which the order was made in the foreign cord. And here, Lord Justice Thorpe, found that the foreign Court had examined the matter very fully in a way he treated as broadly equivalent and therefore the application was dismissed despite the consequences. But he is, I would say, plainly giving guidance as to the wider approach to Section 16, which is not confined purely to the facts of the case. Although of course it is confined to the facts of cases where there has been an order in a foreign court, and I've made it clear that everything I say is directed only at that category of cases.
14	p2,00:53:10.630,00:54:32.430,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It requires the court to consider all circumstances and  then points to a number of specific factors which are, of course relevant but don't detract from the breath of the court having to look at all the circumstances in those circumstances. The Court of Appeal, in this case and in earlier cases as I shall seek to show, has considered whether it is appropriate to adopt a wide approach to Section 16, which would in effect give very wide latitude to applicants to obtain orders having previously obtained leave under Section 13 or a narrow approach. And the Court of Appeal has consistently favoured a narrow approach. And it has done say, principally by reference to the Law commission report which we have looked at but which I shall be asking the court to look at again because in my submission, then the narrow approach is fully justified by the Law Commission report and the Court of appeal in successive judgments going back over some 20 years has been right to adopt a narrow approach and that the Court of Appeal in the present case was doing no more than to follow earlier authority earlier authority which should be respected and upheld by this court.
14	p1,01:10:06.560,01:12:01.650,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Can I now turn please to Section 16 of the Act which is the main section in the  consideration in the appeal? Section 16 incorporates the specific guidelines that the Law Commissioners were talking about, that the judge would consider in the exercise of his discretion. And under Section 16(1), it reads, before making an order for financial relief, the court shall consider whether, in all the circumstances of the case, it would be appropriate for such an order to be made by a court in England and Wales, and if the court is not satisfied that it would be appropriate, the court will dismiss the application. And then in subsection 2, it states the court shall in particular had regard to the following matters. And before we look at those, what the test is setting out in the test of appropriateness is a general consideration of all the circumstances of the case and then the specific matters in subsection 2 A, B and C, which deal with connection to England and Wales, B is connection to, in this case Nigeria. C is connection to any other country which isn't relevant in this case, and then D, E, F and G all deal really with the financial matters arising in each jurisdiction. D doesn't arise here because that concerns an agreement arising in a foreign jurisdiction that would, for example, be if the parties had had a post or prenuptial agreement --

And then as he goes on over the page to page 112, he said, Coleridge J duly paid his tribute to Mr Justice to Mr Justice Munby's judgment relied upon it for the facts set out and the law. And what worries me [added] it is important to note that the court's repeal upheld this order and its conclusions that there was a very significant risk of real hardship if the court refused to make any provision for this wife and that it would be draconian to shut her out. As I have observed, this virtually amounts to quod erat demonstrandum, now the words in quotation in that passage he attributed to Mr Justice Coleridge. But in fact, he mixed up partly what Mr Justice Coleridge said, and partly what Miss Harris was submitting on behalf of the wife in quite a significant to, quite a significant extent. If you please turn to page 62 and at the same time look at page 65 you will see how the mistake came about.
14	p2,00:55:59.440,00:58:30.740,spk_0,	True	Counsel: As the court knows, then the application for permission was made perfectly properly by learned friend Miss Harris to Mr Justice Mumby. An application was then made and conducted by my learned junior Mr Mitchell to set aside the permission which was given. And we have looked at Mr Justice Mumby's full judgment on that. It was at that point that I became involved in the case and I was asked to advise on the possibility of appealing against Mr Justice Munby's judgment. And I advise that an attempt should be made to appeal with hindsight, with the benefit of having read the hurt and now reread many times the judgments of the Court of Appeal. In this case, I accept fully that that was the wrong course to take. But I take responsibility for that. And I would pray in aid in mitigation, then it in at least one of the very few reported cases, namely Hewittson then and then an order for leave, which had been made, was overturned on appeal. And also I pray in aid that neither Mr Justice Mumby nor on appeal from his judgment, the Court of Appeal treated our approach in trying to set aside leave as one which was inherently undesirable, even though in the event we failed. But I do, except with hindsight, that the approach was not only wrong but that it was in the event counterproductive because what then happened was that Mr Justice Mumby having given a very full and characteristically erudite judgment which was then upheld by the Court of Appeal, where I made the further mistake of seeking to renew the application for leave to appeal orally. And so, although, as my learned friend has pointed out, Lord Justice Ward fell into error in conflating at one point the actual judgment Mr Justice Munby, of Mr Justice Coleridge and the point at which Mr Justice Coleridge was setting out the submissions put before him by counsel. But nevertheless, the general point which Lord Justice Ward was making that Mr Justice Coleridge fell into the trap of thinking that because these earlier judgments have dealt with a number of issues fully, he did not need to deal with them. That general point was a good point and was right. And is part of the reason, my lady going back to your question why Mr Justice Coleridge in this case fell into error.

14	p2,01:09:26.870,01:09:54.760,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Well, my Lord, as with many family law statutes that there is a something of a grey area between factual evaluation and an exercise of discretion And while on the face of it, the language the language of section 16 1, strictly speaking might be taken to involve a factual evaluation in practise, particularly bearing in mind that the court has to consider all the circumstances of the case. It is edging certainly very close to a discretionary exercising.
14	p2,00:59:03.810,01:00:43.090,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Well, my Lord, yes, because this is this is the difference that at the permission stage, then the court is looking at section 13 and on the authorities is entitled to look at Section 16 as informing its application of Section 13. But as the Court of Appeal pointed out, both on the appeal from Mr Justice Munby and in the appeal from which Maloney friends appeal comes before this court today, that is, in fact, a different exercise. And it was incumbent on the judge hearing the substantive application to start again de Novo and to put out of his mind any of those aspects of the Section 13 application for permission, which did not relate directly to Section 16. And indeed, it was the duty of Mr Justice Coleridge. And he was invited, more or less directed to do so by Lords Justices Warren Wilson to approach the matter de Novo and to hear the arguments de novo so it would have been inappropriate even leaving aside the technical difficulties of absence of evidence. But it would have been inappropriate for Mr Justice Munby at that stage to adopt the approach which Your Lordship canvases because the judge hearing the substantive application is conducting a separate exercise in which Section 16 and if the applicant gets past that section 18 are the relevant sections, whereas on the application for permission. It is section 13 informed to some extent by section 16, by taking other matters into account which the court is having to consider.
14	p1,01:48:05.270,01:48:39.000,spk_4,	True	Counsel: Mr Justice Munby should have been asking himself the question whether there were substantial grounds, but in fact, he went much further than that. Mr Justice Coleridge should have been asking himself the question whether it was appropriate, in the light of the section 16(2) factors to make an order. He did that, and in so doing, he incorporated the enormous amount of detail that Mr Justice Munby had gone into in dealing with those factors. Yes, quite so. Between them, they covered all the ground.

14	p1,02:13:07.020,02:16:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Dealing with my next section about how Part 3 should be applied, we have already dealt with the problem about the statutory language once the gate is opened and the way the Law Commissioners dealt with the case, and I'd like to make these submissions, that the discretionary powers of the court under Part 3 should be operated, we say, in a flexible way, focused on remitting the hardship and providing a bespoke solution. And that is because the circumstances that will arise in these cases, which involve other jurisdictions, will be so varied in each and every case. It's often said in domestic cases that no two cases are the same and cases are fact specific, and decided on specific facts, and of course that's correct. But in a Part 3 case where there has been a prior financial order, the range of circumstances that the court has to look at under section 16 are very considerable and will vary so much from case to case because you're obviously dealing with different nationalities and different countries. So that's why we say it should be flexible and focused on providing a bespoke solution. And if it's applied within that sort of framework where it's aiming to remit, the hardship that can be identified, then these majority of tags about being a second bite of the cherry really are not that, and if the English court makes an order supplementing the foreign order, in those sort of circumstances, then it would be wrong to characteristics that as being an appeal from the order of the foreign court because my learned friend is going to say we just had a second bite of the cherry. It was all canvassed in Nigeria, and that what Mr Justice Coleridge was doing was the acting as the Court of Appeal on the order made in Nigeria, but we say no, because the whole purpose is a flexible solution aimed at dealing with the injustice that can be seen. And we also submit that when the court considers whether or not it's appropriate to make an order, as part of all the circumstances of the case, it has to consider the impact on the state purse because as a result of a foreign order, a Part 3 applicant may be reduced to being being reliant upon state benefits or having to apply for local authority accommodation. And that is a very relevant factor in most Part 3 cases because the applicant in nine cases out of 10 is going to be here, in order to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements, and his or her target may very well be a property in this country that he or she wants to live in. And we say it is contrary to public policy to cast upon the public person obligation that should really be born within the family. If the means can be found to provide for the wife, then why should the public person have to pay? And that, we say, is a relevant argument when we come to consider comity.
14	p1,01:54:15.640,01:55:23.870,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Mr. Justice Bodey said it seems to me that the English court can be heard to say that although an applicant has just got over the section 16(1) hurdle, nevertheless, it is only appropriate for the English court to intervene with financial relief to the minimum extent necessary, so as to remedy the injustice perceived to exist without intervention. In my view, is it just such a case. Now, that was not based on any other authority, that's Mr Justice Bodey on his own, but it was cited through Mr Justice Coleridge. And if you go back to these, to the bound volume, to Mr Justice Coleridge's at page 68. Sorry. There's an earlier reference. Thank you very much.

I say the application of section 16 because Section 16 is not obscurely worded. It does not give rise to any difficulties of construction. But it is very widely worded and accordingly, it gives rise to the danger that different courts may take different approaches and possibly radically different approaches, which would be liable to lead to very different results on very similar facts. The basic structure of Section 16, which is very similar to Section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act with which all ancillary relief practitioners have engraved in their hearts because --

Certainly, if the judge reached the conclusion that there's no chance of an order being made, it would be silly to give leave to pursue the application. But any jobs doing a section 30 and it's going to look at section 16. The only point I was trying to make, Mr Scott, Please don't misunderstand me was that it was your application to set aside the leave that Mr Justice Munby had given in a short, full judgment, addressing his mind to the correct matters under section 13 and section 16.

14	p1,00:47:24.380,00:50:09.070,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Application is made Ex parte by originating summons. There has been a number of course repeal judgments. Not least of all, of course, the Court of Appeals judgement in this case, concerned about procedure, and if you want any assistance on that, I do have some views as a practitioner. It may or may not be helpful. If I could ask you please to look at the authorities bundle 1, the same bundle in which the report is found and to look at tab 5. This is the case of Holmes, which is one of the leading cases and in fact, was the first case that the Court of Appeal considered in relation not to the substantive order but in relation to whether the [inaudible] should be set aside. And if I could ask you, please, to turn to page 53 of the report, in the judgement of Lord Justice Purchas, he dealt with the phrase 'substantial ground', and what he said has really been the test, the basis that has been applied in subsequent cases. It's just below E on page 53, he said the phrase 'substantial ground' for the making of an application for such an order is clearly central to the issues in this application. Looking at that expression in the immediate context of the Act, I have formed the view that what is required is that the applicants should demonstrate to the court that there is in all the circumstances surrounding the application for financial relief, the orders that may or may not have been made, the presence or absence of powers to grant financial relief in the foreign forum, reasons for saying that there is a substantial ground for making an application. That is a substantial ground upon which the court could be invited to exercise its powers under section 12, within the jurisdiction of section 15. In particular, when the court comes to consider such an application, it will have to take into account under section 16(1), whether in all the circumstances of the case, it would be appropriate for such an order to be made by a court in England and Wales. If it is not satisfied that it would be appropriate, and that is a positive onus, the court shall, as a matter of mandatory instruction, dismiss the application.
15	p1,02:13:07.020,02:16:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Dealing with my next section about how Part 3 should be applied, we have already dealt with the problem about the statutory language once the gate is opened and the way the Law Commissioners dealt with the case, and I'd like to make these submissions, that the discretionary powers of the court under Part 3 should be operated, we say, in a flexible way, focused on remitting the hardship and providing a bespoke solution. And that is because the circumstances that will arise in these cases, which involve other jurisdictions, will be so varied in each and every case. It's often said in domestic cases that no two cases are the same and cases are fact specific, and decided on specific facts, and of course that's correct. But in a Part 3 case where there has been a prior financial order, the range of circumstances that the court has to look at under section 16 are very considerable and will vary so much from case to case because you're obviously dealing with different nationalities and different countries. So that's why we say it should be flexible and focused on providing a bespoke solution. And if it's applied within that sort of framework where it's aiming to remit, the hardship that can be identified, then these majority of tags about being a second bite of the cherry really are not that, and if the English court makes an order supplementing the foreign order, in those sort of circumstances, then it would be wrong to characteristics that as being an appeal from the order of the foreign court because my learned friend is going to say we just had a second bite of the cherry. It was all canvassed in Nigeria, and that what Mr Justice Coleridge was doing was the acting as the Court of Appeal on the order made in Nigeria, but we say no, because the whole purpose is a flexible solution aimed at dealing with the injustice that can be seen. And we also submit that when the court considers whether or not it's appropriate to make an order, as part of all the circumstances of the case, it has to consider the impact on the state purse because as a result of a foreign order, a Part 3 applicant may be reduced to being being reliant upon state benefits or having to apply for local authority accommodation. And that is a very relevant factor in most Part 3 cases because the applicant in nine cases out of 10 is going to be here, in order to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements, and his or her target may very well be a property in this country that he or she wants to live in. And we say it is contrary to public policy to cast upon the public person obligation that should really be born within the family. If the means can be found to provide for the wife, then why should the public person have to pay? And that, we say, is a relevant argument when we come to consider comity.
15	p2,01:50:08.380,01:50:46.290,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Yes, but they also provide guidance as to how the powers conferred by Section 16 should be exercised in this category of case. They show the law commission's thinking. They show what led the law commission on what appears to have been a fairly narrow call, not to exclude completely and therefore those considerations which led the law commission to wonder whether to exclude completely the cases where a foreign order has been made must be relevant in considering how to apply the law where foreign order has been made.
15	p1,02:18:07.719,02:18:38.320,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Well my lord, I would also submit that it's a consideration as to whether it's appropriate or not in the first place, because if you perceive that the hardship is the lack of accommodation, is it not appropriate for the English court to make an order? Why do you have to wait the section 18 stage? Why can't you consider it as one of the circumstances in section 16? I'm not saying it doesn't come into play in section 18, but it should also be a factor that comes into play in section 16 as well.

15	p2,01:40:33.310,01:41:15.890,spk_0,	True	Counsel: No, it can't. But one has to look at the circumstances in which the Section 16 spells out. One has to look at the circumstances in which the order was made in the foreign cord. And here, Lord Justice Thorpe, found that the foreign Court had examined the matter very fully in a way he treated as broadly equivalent and therefore the application was dismissed despite the consequences. But he is, I would say, plainly giving guidance as to the wider approach to Section 16, which is not confined purely to the facts of the case. Although of course it is confined to the facts of cases where there has been an order in a foreign court, and I've made it clear that everything I say is directed only at that category of cases.
15	p2,00:50:50.830,00:51:31.070,spk_2,	True	In construing the provisions of Section 16, they imposed a test by looking at the foreign convenience test that was not contemplated by the Law Commission and is far too restricted the test and it will shut up largely all applications when a foreign court has made a financial order. The whole purpose of section 16 is not, as the Court of Appeal said, to identify only one court which has the closest connection to the parties. But it is to consider whether it's appropriate the English court to make a further order supplementing the foreign order Lord, we see the restoration of the order made at first instance.
15	p1,00:37:35.830,00:40:21.830,spk_2,	True	Counsel: We can see how they expected the new regime to operate. Paragraph 51. Having rejected proposals for a rigid bar on applications, we are left with the alternative of a flexible discretion under which, although an application could be presented by any person able to satisfy the jurisdictional test that we have recommended, such applications would be the subject of preliminary scrutiny by the court, which would only allow the applicant to proceed if, in the circumstances, it was thought appropriate to do so. In the general formulation of the proposed discretion, we think that it should be made clear by express statutory provisions that the object of the discretion is to provide for the quote occasional hard case. We consider, therefore, that the court should be given power to entertain an application for a financial provision or property adjustment order, notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce, if in the light of all the circumstances of the case, and in the particular certain specified circumstances, the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise. Our present inclination is not to favour any requirement that the applicant must establish the facts of the case to be exceptional, since he may well belong to a religious or ethnic group in which it is not uncommon, for example, for a wife should be divorced abroad without having a right to claim financial relief. And if I could just ask you please to turn to page 109, paragraph 66, which is the concluding paragraph of the working paper, just to pick up the point about the condition precedent, the Law Commission has considered whether a Part 3 application could be made if another court in the British Isles have made in order. In other words, if a Scottish court had made an order, could you then come to England for a Part 3 order, and they decided no. And just reading the last paragraph, they said it would nevertheless, in our view, be inappropriate to allow those divorced elsewhere in the British Isles to apply to the courts in England and Wales for financial orders. There will be few, if any, cases in which a person divorced in another part of the British Isles will have suffered 'serious injustice', which we believe it should be necessary to establish as a condition, precedent in the exercise of the powers that we propose.
15	p1,02:18:45.019,02:19:14.330,spk_2,	True	Counsel: But it might be justification or one of the justifications why an order should be made, because it directs the court in section 16(2)(g) to the availability in England and Wales of any property, in respect of which, an order under this part of the act in favour of the applicant could be made.

15	p2,00:51:51.550,00:52:45.400,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The principle question which arises on this appeal is the proper application of section 16 of the 1984 act in circumstances where the all the court which granted the divorce has also made a financial order in favour of the prospective applicants under Part three. I say the application of section 16 because Section 16 is not obscurely worded. It does not give rise to any difficulties of construction. But it is very widely worded and accordingly, it gives rise to the danger that different courts may take different approaches and possibly radically different approaches, which would be liable to lead to very different results on very similar facts. The basic structure of Section 16, which is very similar to Section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act with which all ancillary relief practitioners have engraved in their hearts because -- 
15	p1,01:48:05.270,01:48:39.000,spk_4,	True	Court: Mr Justice Munby should have been asking himself the question whether there were substantial grounds, but in fact, he went much further than that. Mr Justice Coleridge should have been asking himself the question whether it was appropriate, in the light of the section 16(2) factors to make an order. He did that, and in so doing, he incorporated the enormous amount of detail that Mr Justice Munby had gone into in dealing with those factors. Yes, quite so. Between them, they covered all the ground.
15	p2,00:53:10.630,00:54:32.430,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It requires the court to consider all circumstances and  then points to a number of specific factors which are, of course relevant but don't detract from the breath of the court having to look at all the circumstances in those circumstances. The Court of Appeal, in this case and in earlier cases as I shall seek to show, has considered whether it is appropriate to adopt a wide approach to Section 16, which would in effect give very wide latitude to applicants to obtain orders having previously obtained leave under Section 13 or a narrow approach. And the Court of Appeal has consistently favoured a narrow approach. And it has done say, principally by reference to the Law commission report which we have looked at but which I shall be asking the court to look at again because in my submission, then the narrow approach is fully justified by the Law Commission report and the Court of appeal in successive judgments going back over some 20 years has been right to adopt a narrow approach and that the Court of Appeal in the present case was doing no more than to follow earlier authority earlier authority which should be respected and upheld by this court.

15	p1,01:10:06.560,01:12:01.650,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Can I now turn please to Section 16 of the Act which is the main section in the  consideration in the appeal? Section 16 incorporates the specific guidelines that the Law Commissioners were talking about, that the judge would consider in the exercise of his discretion. And under Section 16(1), it reads, before making an order for financial relief, the court shall consider whether, in all the circumstances of the case, it would be appropriate for such an order to be made by a court in England and Wales, and if the court is not satisfied that it would be appropriate, the court will dismiss the application. And then in subsection 2, it states the court shall in particular had regard to the following matters. And before we look at those, what the test is setting out in the test of appropriateness is a general consideration of all the circumstances of the case and then the specific matters in subsection 2 A, B and C, which deal with connection to England and Wales, B is connection to, in this case Nigeria. C is connection to any other country which isn't relevant in this case, and then D, E, F and G all deal really with the financial matters arising in each jurisdiction. D doesn't arise here because that concerns an agreement arising in a foreign jurisdiction that would, for example, be if the parties had had a post or prenuptial agreement --
15	p1,01:15:57.840,01:16:32.060,spk_0,	True	Court:I mean, as I understand it, it is dealing with whether or not, because you consider this before you make the order, it's dealing with whether you are the appropriate court to be making an order at all because it's only when you get into 17 and 18 that they then tell you what you're actually going to do. Yes. I mean to that extent, sure, I mean, I mean, the Law Commission presumably peruse the headings of the sections as well. So I mean, you know, there they are, they didn't think appropriate venue was an inappropriate way of looking at the matter.

15	p1,00:10:27.300,00:20:34.350,spk_2,	True	Counsel: They pose the specific question. Should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? The difficulties in the way of reform of the law are thus formidable. They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied for financial relief in the country where the divorce was granted, but either failed to do so or did so, but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate. Correspondingly, the difficulties are least acute in cases where the law of the country where the divorce was granted contained no provision for financially relief in favour of the wife. We think there is little doubt that a wife who is thus unable to obtain any financial relief, should, provided she can establish a sufficient link between the marriage and this country, be eligible to apply for a financial order here. But we have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court to hear applications for financial relief, notwithstanding the existence of a prior foreign decree of divorce, should be exercisable only in such cases and not in cases where the foreign court had made, or could have made a financial order. We are, however, in no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one with which the marriage has much real connection, but there are also subsidiary arguments which seemed to us to support the view that a restriction of this kind would be undesirable. First, injustice could occur if the foreign divorce court, having dealt with part of a wife's claim for financial relief, could not or would not make any order in relation to capital assets in England, and the English court were precluded from making any order because of the foreign court's order. And my lords and my lady, we say that that really strikes at the very heart of this appeal because in the Nigerian court, the position was that they could not make an order to transfer Litton Road to the wife, and nor would they make any order for her to have a settlement of that property either. And as you will see when we go on to look at the statute, the Law Commissioner's view that there should be no restriction was actually enshrined in the statute, specifically in section 13(2), where the statute says that you can make an application, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order for financial provision. The foundation of Part 3 was based on the Law Commissioner's view that a foreign court which had granted the divorce was not necessarily the only court to deal with all issues arising from the divorce, and they came to this decision for for two reasons. First, they recognise the increasing international mobility, which meant that a marriage and the spouses can have connections with more than one jurisdiction and one legal system. Where they married, where they are domiciles, where they are nationals, and where they have lived during the marriage, pre and post separation, and where their assets are located, give them a connection with more than one jurisdiction. And if I could ask you, please, to look at paragraph 27 which is the preceding paragraph to the one that I just referred to, and just starting from the second sentence, it reads. In a world of pure legal analysis, it would no doubt be possible to identify a single system of law with which the marriage was more closely connected than any other. That system could then be regarded as the proper law of the marriage. As such, it would govern the marriage and its consequences. We do not, however, think that this aim can in practise, be achieved at a time when people can travel easily from one country to another. Marriages are increasingly connected with several different systems of law, for example, with the law of the party's nationality or the law of their place of residence, the place where the marriage was celebrated, or even with the law of their religion. In our view, it is unrealistic to suppose that a process of juristic analysis will identify any single right system of law to which all questions relevant to a particular marriage should be referred to the exclusion of all other systems. In this particular case, although it is right to say that during the marriage the parties spent most of their married life in Nigeria, they have a longstanding and enduring connection with this country. This case is a very good example, we say, of the sort of category of case that the Law Commissioners were considering in paragraph 27. There is no right or obvious jurisdiction to resolve all matters that arise in this case, and it's interesting perhaps, to make the point that both parties had jurisdiction to issue a petition for divorce in Nigeria, and in England. That shows the the connection. It is difficult when you look at the background to the case, which I'll come to a bit in more detail in the moment, it's difficult to identify any aspect of the party's lives that did not have a connection with England, from the very beginning. They met here, married here, and the husband still owns two properties here. They are dual nationals, and perhaps the most striking feature of the case, from a financial point of view, is that 75% of the parties' wealth is not in Nigeria, but it's in England. The second reason for the Law Commission as rejecting the principle that only one court should decide all financial matters consequent on divorce, was that the commissioners recognised that an injustice could arise when the foreign court had made an order which was inadequate and produced a serious injustice. This inadequacy could arise in a number of different ways. First, the foreign court might not have extensive powers to make financial orders. It might be only able to make orders for maintenance, as opposed to orders for lump sum or, as we have in this country, property adjustment. Secondly, the foreign court might not have the power to make orders in respect of property, especially immovable property outside its territorial jurisdiction. This meant that a property in England would be outside the ambit, or could be outside the ambit of a foreign order. And also lastly, of significance in this particular case, is that foreign courts do not necessarily have the range of orders that courts can exercise in this country. The range of orders might be very limited, as was the position here where the Nigerian court, it is common ground, only has power to order a settlement of property and not an order for property adjustment, which transfers the ownership of property from one spouse to another. Also underlying the Act was the Law Commissioner's concern about the financial burden that could be thrust on the public purse, if the effect of the foreign order made inadequate provision, and that is referred to not only in the report but also in the working paper. If I could just ask you please to turn back in tab 1 to page 2, it's the second page of the Commissioner's report. They were dealing with a situation where no order had been made by the foreign court. I'm just reading four lines down from the top of page 2. Such a woman may thus face destitution, and her only source of financial support may be supplementary benefit, and if benefit is paid to her, the supplementary benefits authorities will have no legal right to recover the sums paid from the husband, since he will no longer be a 'liable' relative. The fact that the husband lives in this country and has substantial assets here makes no difference to the legal position. And that concern about being a drain on the public part is also a factor in this case because as a result of the Court of Appeal decision, the wife has been deprived of the means to provide a modest property for herself. And if she wants to remain living in London, where she has lived for the last 10 years, she will have to apply for local authority housing, and I will develop this point in due course.

16	p1,01:19:22.680,01:20:04.150,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Quite right, and the reason underlining this, as I've mentioned in our written cases, that in a convention forum non conveniens dispute, you have concurrent proceedings in two different countries, proceedings going on at the same time. And one court has to decide which country will determine the dispute. In a Part 3 application, you do not have concurrent proceedings, because one court will have already decided on the divorce. It would have made the order. The couple divorced, and it will have gone on to make a financial order. So you're not looking at competing jurisdictions. It's a very, very different argument, and the --

The reason why we say that a forum non conveniens test, a strict forum non conveniens test should not be incorporated here, is that the very foundation of the of the Act was that the Law Commissioners had decided that there was not one right system of law that should necessarily be applied to the exclusion of all others. In certain cases, in cases where there were links with other jurisdictions, you don't look to decide which is the right law and the only law. You can look to see whether other jurisdictions can also be an appropriate jurisdiction to make a further order to supplement the order made by the foreign court who made the first order.

It concerned a French couple who had lived in London during the marriage, but towards the end of the marriage, the wife had left and went to live in New York, taking their son with her. She told the husband she was not returning to England and she left and went to New York, and the husband issued proceedings in Paris, and the wife then followed with proceedings in London. Her connections with England were described by Lord Templeman as tenuous, and the husband applied to stay her petition in England, and the House of Lords allowed his appeal and stayed the petition and said that the test at common law in cases of forum non conveniens should also be the test under the statute dealing with concurrent divorce proceedings. And if I could ask you please to turn to the speech of Lord Templeman at page 98 of the report, I just wanted to refer you to the specific section that they were looking at in relation to -- whether or not there should be an imposition of a stay when they [inaudible] current divorce proceedings.
16	p1,00:21:54.940,00:27:06.170,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In our view, the advantage of giving a remedy needs to be very carefully balanced, not only against the risks of forum shopping. That is the risk that litigants with little or no real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that to confer such a power on the courts could, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply, to the incidence of a particular marriage, pose problems which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to resolve. Where we don't need to be concerned about the applicable law in the case because English law is applied, and in Scotland, Scots Law is applied. In order to meet their concerns about forum shopping, the Law Commissioners proposed three specific safeguards. The first, where jurisdictional requirements based on those four divorce proceedings. They considered that the party should, or either of the party should be domiciled in England and Wales, at the time the application was made, or when the foreign divorce order was made or alternatively, either of the parties could be habitually resident in this jurisdiction for a period of 12 months, either before the application was made or the foreign divorce took effect. There is also another basis for jurisdiction, which doesn't apply in this case but I'll mention it anyway, because the wife could have come within this provision had she wanted to. And that provision is that if either of the parties had a beneficial interest in a property that had been a matrimonial home in this jurisdiction, if you invoke that limb of jurisdiction, then the claimant is restricted to the amount of the beneficial interest. In other words, you can't get more than the beneficial interest that's owned by the other spouse. The second safeguard, to guard against forum shopping, was a filter process in the form of an Ex parte application before a High Court judge, for leave to bring the Part 3 application. The purpose of that was obviously to filter out unmeritorious applications before the other spouse was involved in the proceedings. The third safeguard was consideration by the judge of what the Commissioner's described as some specific guidelines, which we will see in due course, because these guidelines became incorporated in section 16, which is the main statutory provisions that we're concerned with in this case. And those guidelines were to assist the court in the exercise of its discretion to determine whether it was appropriate for the English court to make an order, and these guidelines, as we shall see, focus on connection to this jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction in which the foreign divorce was made, and then on financial matters arising in the jurisdictions. There was no issue in this case at any stage about jurisdiction. The wife based her application on her habitual residents here. Of some significance we say, in this case, is the fact that the wife was acquitted of forum shopping. The very feature of the reforms that the Law Commissioners were concerned about. Mr Justice Munby, who dealt with the Ex parte application and then the inter-parties application brought by the husband to set aside the granted leave. On the papers before him, acquitted the wife of forum shopping. If I could ask you please to turn to the bound volume and appendix 1, what I'd like to refer you please to page 45, which is his judgement. It's page 45, paragraph 58, towards the bottom of the page. Little Roman two.
16	p1,01:22:42.100,01:23:27.400,spk_2,	True	Counsel: If the Law Commissioners had intended to have provided a forum non conveniens test, then we say they would have incorporated the language in the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act of 1973, because that was a statute that they were looking at because it dealt with the jurisdictional requirements for a divorce. And if I could just ask you please to look in the authorities bundle at tab three.
16	p3,01:26:54.170,01:29:25.850,spk_1,	True	Counsel: It is much more appropriate and certainly in line with comity for the English court to look at a foreign order, where such an order has been made and to consider whether serious injustice will result. Now it may be that the -- I don't accept that the introduction of foreign [inaudible] principles is entirely outside the Law Commission report or, indeed, that it's outside the statute because Section 16(2)(a) and (b) plainly do require a degree of comparison between the jurisdictions, which itself imports to some extent [inaudible] principles. And so in those circumstances, the court has to consider, we suggest, whether the foreign order has resulted in an objective sense in serious injustice. And I say in an objective sense, because of course, as has been said in many cases, what is fair for one party will almost inevitably seem unfair to the other. And so the court has to stand back and look at it objectively. But that objective overview has to be taken according to the appropriate lens or prism, and if the case is in a wider sense, an English case through and through, then the English court is more likely to find that the foreign order is objectively unjust. If the case is very substantially a Nigerian case, which this case was found to be both by the English and the Nigerian courts, then the English court should approach the question of serious injustice through the Nigerian lens, in which case there is no ground for any criticism because we have seen how the Nigerian court approached it. There is no criticism of the fairness of the procedure, the outcome, although no doubt disappointing for the wife was -- the court may think well within the bracket of what might be expected in the way in which she [inaudible] and the way in which she put her case. And very importantly, she did not appeal it. So it is, we suggest, in the context of this case, the purest forum shopping to come to the English court, having tried to [inaudible] --
16	p1,01:24:55.590,01:26:16.880,spk_2,	True	Counsel: I just wanted to refer you to the specific section that they were looking at in relation to whether or not there should be an imposition of a stay when they're working current divorce proceedings. And looking at the second paragraph, he said, where there are concurrent proceedings in England and in another jurisdiction, in respect of the same marriage, under section 5(6) of the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973 applies, and paragraph 9 of schedule 1 to that act provides that English proceedings may be stayed if it appears to the court that the balance of fairness, including convenience as between the parties to the marriage, is such that it is appropriate for the proceedings in another jurisdiction to be disposed of before further steps are taken in the proceedings in England. In considering the balance of fairness and convenience, the court shall have regard to all the factors appearing to be relevant, including the convenience of witnesses, and any delay or expense which may result from the proceedings being stayed or not being stayed. So here we have a specific forum non conveniens test in a statute dealing with concurrent divorce proceedings that the Law Commissioners, as they say in their report, were looking at, because they were dealing with the jurisdiction requirements for divorce, which are also in the statute.
16	p2,01:21:15.290,01:22:14.020,spk_0,	True	Counsel: But, and this is the key point because this is where forum conveniens comes in, that the greater the party's connection with the court, which made the original financial order, the slower the English court would be to interfere with that order. So in normal circumstances, forum convenience is an either or issue, As my Lord pointed out this morning. But here, what I suggest is that it introduces a sliding scale so that the English court has to evaluate under Section 16 the degree of connection with, on the one hand, the foreign Court and on the other hand, the English court and, if appropriate, the courts of any third country. But that doesn't arise here. So Section 16, Paragraphs A and B do directly introduce a forum convenience approach by requiring a comparative evaluation of connection with the original country and with England.

16	p2,01:23:42.510,01:24:44.090,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And of course, much of this jurisprudence derives from the observations of Lord Govinda, Don Kia, where he dealt with the count, and Countess de, who were as thoroughly French as it was possible to be, and at that stage all 20 years ago. And I understand French law has changed conduct was a highly relevant factor in the assessment of what we would call ancillary relief, and if the countess was found to have committed adultery, then her prospective award would be greatly reduced. But Lord Goff said, well, she is French France. It's a civilised country, our closest neighbour. It's not unjust in these circumstances that she should take her chance in the French courts. Yeah, and so, my Lord, that is how forum convenience comes into this. It is by means. And I hope to demonstrate that this derives directly from the law commission report. It is a means of showing which with which country the couple have the closest connection.

16	p1,01:12:04.960,01:14:06.670,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Or a deferred dower, I think, is another example that the Law Commissioners gave. E is obviously highly relevant here. It's where the foreign court has made an order for the wife of any child of the family, and the extent to which the order has been complied with or is likely to be complied with. F does not arise here. It deals with any right with the applicant, has or had had to make an application for financial relief in the foreign forum. And then G and H are relevant here. It deals with the availability in England and Wales of any property, in respect to which an order under this part of the Act can be made, in favour of the applicant. And then H deals will extent to which any order made under this Act can be enforceable, so G and H are relevant. I is not relevant. It deals with the length of time that has elapsed since the date of the divorce. You will see that the heading fo section 16 states duty of the court to consider whether England and Wales is appropriate venue for application. That side heading using the words appropriate venue, gives an indication of forum non conveniens considerations. But if you do a word search on the 116 pages of the report from the working paper, the word venue only comes up in the heading here, and if you also do a word search for forum non conveniens, it simply doesn't come up at all. And that is because there was no discussion in the working paper in the report about venue or for inconvenience matters, which is perhaps surprising, bearing in mind Dr Peter North was one of the Commissioners.

16	p2,01:48:48.770,01:49:43.190,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And the primary reason for including this provision at all is to cater for the case in which the parties have little or no connection with the country where the divorce has been ordered. Yeah, Now we then go on, um, to, uh, the point which Maloney friend relies upon particularly injustice could occur if the foreign Divorce Court, having dealt with part of a wider acclaim for a financial relief, could not or would not make any order in relation to capital assets in England. And the English court precluded from making any order because of the foreign court's order. Well, that cannot be taken out of context. And when we look at the Nigerian proceedings, then I shall be suggesting that that simply does not apply to the facts of this case. If it does, if you would be against me on that, then it has to be taken against the content in the context that that is a secondary reason. And the primary reason is the forum convenience argument. 
16	p1,00:31:50.440,00:32:39.870,spk_2,	True	Counsel: I'm going to come onto this later, when you look at the judgement of Lord Justice Ward, he has made the point, well, if you don't grant an anti-suit injunction, but you stay the English petition here on the basis that Nigeria is the appropriate forum. How can it be right to say that Nigeria shouldn't deal with the case? Well, the irony is that the judge who dealt with the application postulated the possibility of the wife making a Part 3 application in his judgement. I was dealing with the the forum shopping acquittal.

17	p1,00:21:54.940,00:27:06.170,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In our view, the advantage of giving a remedy needs to be very carefully balanced, not only against the risks of forum shopping. That is the risk that litigants with little or no real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that to confer such a power on the courts could, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply, to the incidence of a particular marriage, pose problems which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to resolve. Where we don't need to be concerned about the applicable law in the case because English law is applied, and in Scotland, Scots Law is applied. In order to meet their concerns about forum shopping, the Law Commissioners proposed three specific safeguards. The first, where jurisdictional requirements based on those four divorce proceedings.

17	p1,01:18:23.020,01:19:17.560,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes. Yes, quite. The reason why we say that a forum non conveniens test, a strict forum non conveniens test should not be incorporated here, is that the very foundation of the of the Act was that the Law Commissioners had decided that there was not one right system of law that should necessarily be applied to the exclusion of all others. In certain cases, in cases where there were links with other jurisdictions, you don't look to decide which is the right law and the only law. You can look to see whether other jurisdictions can also be an appropriate jurisdiction to make a further order to supplement the order made by the foreign court who made the first order.
17	p1,01:24:55.590,01:26:16.880,spk_2,	True	Counsel: I just wanted to refer you to the specific section that they were looking at in relation to whether or not there should be an imposition of a stay when they're working current divorce proceedings.

In considering the balance of fairness and convenience, the court shall have regard to all the factors appearing to be relevant, including the convenience of witnesses, and any delay or expense which may result from the proceedings being stayed or not being stayed. So here we have a specific forum non conveniens test in a statute dealing with concurrent divorce proceedings that the Law Commissioners, as they say in their report, were looking at, because they were dealing with the jurisdiction requirements for divorce, which are also in the statute.
17	p1,01:27:30.350,01:28:51.120,spk_2,	True	Counsel: But we say the test here is not whether or not Nigeria is or is not the appropriate forum. The test is whether it is appropriate for the English forum to make a further order, and an order for the court to be satisfied that it is appropriate, it has to look at the connection with this country, because it's the connection with this country that decides whether or not the applicant is a forum shopper or not. If you can show, as I mentioned, when I referred you to the definition, if you can show that you have a connection with this country, then you are likely to be acquitted of forum shoppin, because you are making a claim in a forum in which you have a jurisdiction. As I mentioned, it's one of the unfortunate features of this case for the wife that she didn't issue her petition at an earlier stage in this case because she had jurisdiction to issue a petition here, probably from the summer of 2000. So my lord, we say that when the Court of Appeal said through Lord Justice Ward that when you look at Section 16 what the court has to do is to identity which court has the closest and most appropriate connection in order to find one forum.
17	p1,01:17:01.690,01:17:20.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The language is not proposing a test for the court to decide with which jurisdiction the marriage has the closest connection. It's not proposing a forum non conveniens test where the court should undertake an inquiry to find the natural and appropriate forum. All those words we are used to seeing when such a test is --

17	p1,01:10:06.560,01:12:01.650,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Can I now turn please to Section 16 of the Act which is the main section in the consideration in the appeal? Section 16 incorporates the specific guidelines that the Law Commissioners were talking about, that the judge would consider in the exercise of his discretion. And under Section 16(1), it reads, before making an order for financial relief, the court shall consider whether, in all the circumstances of the case, it would be appropriate for such an order to be made by a court in England and Wales, and if the court is not satisfied that it would be appropriate, the court will dismiss the application. And then in subsection 2, it states the court shall in particular had regard to the following matters. And before we look at those, what the test is setting out in the test of appropriateness is a general consideration of all the circumstances of the case and then the specific matters in subsection 2 A, B and C, which deal with connection to England and Wales, B is connection to, in this case Nigeria. C is connection to any other country which isn't relevant in this case, and then D, E, F and G all deal really with the financial matters arising in each jurisdiction. D doesn't arise here because that concerns an agreement arising in a foreign jurisdiction that would, for example, be if the parties had had a post or prenuptial agreement --
17	p2,01:21:15.290,01:22:14.020,spk_0,	True	Counsel: But, and this is the key point because this is where forum conveniens comes in, that the greater the party's connection with the court, which made the original financial order, the slower the English court would be to interfere with that order.

17	p1,01:19:22.680,01:20:04.150,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Quite right, and the reason underlining this, as I've mentioned in our written cases, that in a convention forum non conveniens dispute, you have concurrent proceedings in two different countries, proceedings going on at the same time. And one court has to decide which country will determine the dispute. In a Part 3 application, you do not have concurrent proceedings, because one court will have already decided on the divorce. It would have made the order. The couple divorced, and it will have gone on to make a financial order. So you're not looking at competing jurisdictions. It's a very, very different argument, and the --

17	p2,00:50:50.830,00:51:31.070,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In construing the provisions of Section 16, they imposed a test by looking at the foreign convenience test that was not contemplated by the law commission and is far too restricted the test and it will shut up largely all applications when a foreign court has made a financial order. The whole purpose of section 16 is not, as the Court of Appeal said, to identify only one court which has the closest connection to the parties. But it is to consider whether it's appropriate the English court to make a further order supplementing the foreign order Lord, we see the restoration of the order made at first instance.
17	p1,01:22:42.100,01:23:27.400,spk_2,	True	Counsel: If the Law Commissioners had intended to have provided a forum non conveniens test, then we say they would have incorporated the language in the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act of 1973, because that was a statute that they were looking at because it dealt with the jurisdictional requirements for a divorce.

17	p2,01:42:56.900,01:44:39.320,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Paragraph 22 line 4. It is thus our view that in some circumstances the court in England should have power to make a financial order in favour of a former spouse whose marriage has been terminated by foreign decree. However, we found considerable difficulty in defining it precisely what circumstances such a power should be exercisable. In our view, the advantage of giving a remedy needs to be very carefully balanced, and not only against the risks of forum shopping. That is a risk that litigants with little on a real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that confer such a power on the courts. Would, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply to the incidence of a particular marriage, those problems which which will be difficult, if not impossible, to solve Could I just say there that the definition which is put forward their for forum shopping is, we would say only one aspect of the possible categories of forum shopping. And that's another aspect of foreign shopping is we say what happened in this case where somebody tries to ride two horses and and then at the bottom of paragraph 20 for the bottom of the page. After dealing with the hypothetical rural Taney. In example, problems could arise even if the wife were able to make a claim of financial relief and in fact did so but either failed to obtain any order or obtained an order which he thought to be inadequate. Should she be able to apply to the English court?

And that is because the circumstances that will arise in these cases, which involve other jurisdictions, will be so varied in each and every case. It's often said in domestic cases that no two cases are the same and cases are fact specific, and decided on specific facts, and of course that's correct. But in a Part 3 case where there has been a prior financial order, the range of circumstances that the court has to look at under section 16 are very considerable and will vary so much from case to case because you're obviously dealing with different nationalities and different countries. So that's why we say it should be flexible and focused on providing a bespoke solution. And if it's applied within that sort of framework where it's aiming to remit, the hardship that can be identified, then these majority of tags about being a second bite of the cherry really are not that, and if the English court makes an order supplementing the foreign order, in those sort of circumstances, then it would be wrong to characteristics that as being an appeal from the order of the foreign court because my learned friend is going to say we just had a second bite of the cherry. It was all canvassed in Nigeria, and that what Mr Justice Coleridge was doing was the acting as the Court of Appeal on the order made in Nigeria, but we say no, because the whole purpose is a flexible solution aimed at dealing with the injustice that can be seen. And we also submit that when the court considers whether or not it's appropriate to make an order, as part of all the circumstances of the case, it has to consider the impact on the state purse because as a result of a foreign order, a Part 3 applicant may be reduced to being being reliant upon state benefits or having to apply for local authority accommodation. And that is a very relevant factor in most Part 3 cases because the applicant in nine cases out of 10 is going to be here, in order to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements, and his or her target may very well be a property in this country that he or she wants to live in. And we say it is contrary to public policy to cast upon the public person obligation that should really be born within the family. If the means can be found to provide for the wife, then why should the public person have to pay? And that, we say, is a relevant argument when we come to consider comity.

And we say it is contrary to public policy to cast upon the public person obligation that should really be born within the family. If the means can be found to provide for the wife, then why should the public person have to pay? And that, we say, is a relevant argument when we come to consider comity.

18	p3,00:09:24.260,00:11:48.640,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The final point which I would make before going back to the authorities arises out of My Lady's interjection yesterday which, if I may say it was perhaps intended to be expressed in terms of provoked debate, the effect of are we supposed to stand by and allow injustice to carry on? I'm paraphrasing, but your Ladyship did make a comment to that effect. My Lady, that is, in fact, if I may say so, a critically important point, which is actually central to this appeal. But the short answer to the point is that there are, because there are no internationally recognised standards of what is fairness, then the question we would suggest should be reframed as follows: in what circumstances should the English courts take it upon themselves to decide that the decisions of a foreign court are so unjust that the English court should intervene? [Long pause]. And the first, to give some examples of that where we would say the English court either could not or would not intervene, whatever the award of the foreign court was. If we take a fairly typical British ancillary relief case, the case of a family where the husband has a good income, there are young children, the wife has little or no earning capacity, and the only capital asset is a matrimonial home subject to a substantial mortgage. Then, in England, the almost inevitable outcome of that situation is going to be that the wife will receive probably the bulk of such capital as there is, and virtually certainly an open ended periodical payments order. In Scotland, as we have seen from the summary of the recommendations we were looking at a moment ago, her claim for periodical payments would be restricted to three years, and so that by itself, even without straying outside the jurisdiction of this court, we have two different regimes which can produce radically different results on the same set of facts, according to whether the proceedings are brought in England, or in Scotland.
18	p1,00:37:35.830,00:40:21.830,spk_2,	True	Counsel: We can see how they expected the new regime to operate. Paragraph 51. Having rejected proposals for a rigid bar on applications, we are left with the alternative of a flexible discretion under which, although an application could be presented by any person able to satisfy the jurisdictional test that we have recommended, such applications would be the subject of preliminary scrutiny by the court, which would only allow the applicant to proceed if, in the circumstances, it was thought appropriate to do so. In the general formulation of the proposed discretion, we think that it should be made clear by express statutory provisions that the object of the discretion is to provide for the quote occasional hard case. We consider, therefore, that the court should be given power to entertain an application for a financial provision or property adjustment order, notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce, if in the light of all the circumstances of the case, and in the particular certain specified circumstances, the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise. Our present inclination is not to favour any requirement that the applicant must establish the facts of the case to be exceptional, since he may well belong to a religious or ethnic group in which it is not uncommon, for example, for a wife should be divorced abroad without having a right to claim financial relief. And if I could just ask you please to turn to page 109, paragraph 66, which is the concluding paragraph of the working paper, just to pick up the point about the condition precedent, the Law Commission has considered whether a Part 3 application could be made if another court in the British Isles have made in order. In other words, if a Scottish court had made an order, could you then come to England for a Part 3 order, and they decided no. And just reading the last paragraph, they said it would nevertheless, in our view, be inappropriate to allow those divorced elsewhere in the British Isles to apply to the courts in England and Wales for financial orders. There will be few, if any, cases in which a person divorced in another part of the British Isles will have suffered 'serious injustice', which we believe it should be necessary to establish as a condition, precedent in the exercise of the powers that we propose.
18	p2,00:41:46.270,00:43:24.770,spk_2,	True	Counsel: He said the discretion which the Act gives the court under Section 13 is wide, and I do not seek to fetter it. Generally, cases have to be considered on their own circumstances and merits the examples that learning friend gives. Would not my submission reflect that sentiment? Well, I would then like to come to the doctrine of commodity because this is something that is not in Section 16. But it is a matter which the Court of Appeal says has a significant influence on the way decisions are taken under part 3 and Lord Justice Ward said specifically that commodity is an important factor in this case. Yeah, we say that to some extent comedy has been observed in this case because the Nigerian divorce decree was recognised. The findings made by the Nigerian judge were stood in these proceedings and because of the case management and conditions laid down by Mr Justice Munby, we did not have a de Novo claim. So to that extent there was an element of comedy. But looking at comedy as a wider principle, it is not a matter of an absolute obligation. Commodity has to be balanced against other factors and we identify 5 factors which would justify a court in saying that comedy does not have to be treated as such a significant factor as the Court of Appeal did in this case.

18	p2,01:21:15.290,01:22:14.020,spk_0,	True	Counsel: But, and this is the key point because this is where forum conveniens comes in, that the greater the party's connection with the court, which made the original financial order, the slower the English court would be to interfere with that order. So in normal circumstances, forum convenience is an either or issue, As my Lord pointed out this morning. But here, what I suggest is that it introduces a sliding scale so that the English court has to evaluate under Section 16 the degree of connection with, on the one hand, the foreign Court and on the other hand, the English court and, if appropriate, the courts of any third country. But that doesn't arise here. So Section 16, Paragraphs A and B do directly introduce a forum convenience approach by requiring a comparative evaluation of connection with the original country and with England.

18	p2,00:43:26.050,00:44:24.740,spk_2,	True	Counsel: And we identity five factors that would justify a court in saying comity does not have to be treated as such a significant factor as the Court of Appeal did in this case. And I guess those five factors in order of hierarchy. The first one is that Parliament has authorised in Section 132 for orders to be made notwithstanding, a foreign court has made an order. Yeah, so it's therefore implicit that every part 3 order that's made will offend the doctor of comedy. It's interesting, just as a side note to mention again that if you put comedy into a word search in the law commission report, you get one obscure reference. Have no relevance. So it was obviously not a factor that they considered should weigh in the balance. Yeah. My second factor is that comedy should not be strictly observed. If that results in an expense on the public purse.

18	p2,00:46:59.380,00:48:40.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: My third point is, when you consider issues of comity, you look at the nature of the proceedings involved and the extent to which there is any direct interference with the operation of the foreign court. So if you have an application for an anti suit injunction in an international trade case, that's obviously a direct interference with the operation of the foreign Court at the outset of the litigation. That's when issues of comedy have to be seriously considered, whereas a part three order, by contrast, is supplementing a foreign order after it's been made. So there's no direct interference with the operation of the foreign court. Fourthly, the location of the assets that are being sought is also a comedy consideration because the Part three order here is not directed to assets in Nigeria. It's directed to a property in London. Yeah, and my last point is, England is not unique in having part three legislation. There are, as we know, Northern Ireland, Scotland, the Republic of Ireland have statutes to that effect, and you'll see in our written case that we have identified other jurisdictions in the Commonwealth that also have cinema provisions. They're not identical, but they do permit a second application. So in relation to comedy, we say that there is the reverse comedy point that the foreign court should recognise that other countries in their domestic law have a dual application provision.

19	p1,02:13:07.020,02:16:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Dealing with my next section about how Part 3 should be applied, we have already dealt with the problem about the statutory language once the gate is opened and the way the Law Commissioners dealt with the case, and I'd like to make these submissions, that the discretionary powers of the court under Part 3 should be operated, we say, in a flexible way, focused on remitting the hardship and providing a bespoke solution. And that is because the circumstances that will arise in these cases, which involve other jurisdictions, will be so varied in each and every case. It's often said in domestic cases that no two cases are the same and cases are fact specific, and decided on specific facts, and of course that's correct. But in a Part 3 case where there has been a prior financial order, the range of circumstances that the court has to look at under section 16 are very considerable and will vary so much from case to case because you're obviously dealing with different nationalities and different countries. So that's why we say it should be flexible and focused on providing a bespoke solution. And if it's applied within that sort of framework where it's aiming to remit, the hardship that can be identified, then these majority of tags about being a second bite of the cherry really are not that, and if the English court makes an order supplementing the foreign order, in those sort of circumstances, then it would be wrong to characteristics that as being an appeal from the order of the foreign court because my learned friend is going to say we just had a second bite of the cherry. It was all canvassed in Nigeria, and that what Mr Justice Coleridge was doing was the acting as the Court of Appeal on the order made in Nigeria, but we say no, because the whole purpose is a flexible solution aimed at dealing with the injustice that can be seen. And we also submit that when the court considers whether or not it's appropriate to make an order, as part of all the circumstances of the case, it has to consider the impact on the state purse because as a result of a foreign order, a Part 3 applicant may be reduced to being being reliant upon state benefits or having to apply for local authority accommodation. And that is a very relevant factor in most Part 3 cases because the applicant in nine cases out of 10 is going to be here, in order to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements, and his or her target may very well be a property in this country that he or she wants to live in. And we say it is contrary to public policy to cast upon the public person obligation that should really be born within the family. If the means can be found to provide for the wife, then why should the public person have to pay? And that, we say, is a relevant argument when we come to consider comity.

19	p3,00:31:12.600,00:32:02.180,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The next authority in time is that of the Court of Appeal in Jordan, at divider 7, where what in effect was being attempted, was to use Part 3 to to enforce an order which had been made in California. But again, there are wide observations, and if we can turn to the judgment of Lord Justice Thorpe at 219, letter F, Of course, the paradigm case creating the need for the legislation was the case where the decree of the Foreign Court was entitled to recognition in this jurisdiction, but where that court did not offer any rights to financial provision either at all or alternatively on any basis comparable to the rights arising under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 in this jurisdiction. The opening sentences of the Law Commission report so state.
19	p1,00:55:35.760,01:04:31.320,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes he is, I agree. If we could please, then turn to page 59. This is the short judgement of Lord Justice Russell, which is often quoted in these cases and indeed was quoted in this case by Mr Justice Munby, reading from the second sentence, the test in section 31 is in my judgement, plainly, a more stringent one, that's referring to judicial review. Prima facie, the order of the foreign court should prevail, save in exceptional circumstances, and a good case for any interference with it or adjustment of it or any supplementation of it should be apparent before any leave is granted under section 13, where the foreign court is properly seizing the dispute, as it was in this case. So far as it is possible, duplicity of proceedings should be avoided in this, as in all other fields and in the interests of the parties and their children, as well as in the interests of justice and the comity of nations. So he sees it as a strict test, a hard test, where there has been a foreign order. He's talking about exceptional circumstances, although the statute doesn't refer to that, and the and the Law Commission has actually said they did not want it to cover an exceptional case. But what is significant in my submission is the use of the word supplementation. Because what really happened here was that there was supplementation of the Nigerian order. And could we please look at Mr Justice Munby's judgement, again, it's in the bound volume. At appendix 1, page 47. It is paragraphs 59 and 60. This is how he dealt with the substantial ground test. At the end of the day, the real issue seems to me to be the same as it was when this case was first before me. To paraphrase what I said in my earlier judgement, is this in truth, simply a case where a wife is seeking to have a second bite of the cherry following proceedings in a foreign country which, although not satisfactory from her point of view and although not as generous from her point of view as comparable proceedings, would be in this country were nevertheless appropriately conducted and which led to a financial order in her favour, which can be and has been implemented? Or is it, on the other hand, a case where the circumstances are sufficiently exceptional, using the word in the sense in which it was used by Lord Justice Russell, that notwithstanding the making of a significant order in her favour by the foreign court, it is nonetheless proper to enable her to pursue a second application in this country. In my judgement, this case falls into the latter category. What is in my judgement, the very considerable discrepancy, indeed, between the aggregate value of what this court would consider to be the relevant matrimonial assets, some of the most valuable being located in this country, and the very modest amount of the provisions made for this wife following a marriage of, I emphasise 32 years, justifies the conclusion that there is within the meaning of section 31 of the Act, substantial ground for her making the application. If I deny her relief, she will suffer hardship, in my judgement, very serious hardship indeed, being faced in all probability with the unenviable choice of either remaining homeless in this country, where she is now based and where she wants to stay, or returning to Nigeria. And the test that he applied there was approved by the Court of Appeal when the husband's application for leave to appeal was dismissed. Part 3 proceedings have attracted the pejorative tag of being a second bite of the cherry, and that description implies that a Part 3 application is a complete rerun of the same proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction, and that what happens is that all the issues are canvassed again before a different judge in a different country with a different adjudication sort. But, my lord, we say that that is not the purpose of Part 3, and that is certainly not how it was envisaged it would be utilised by the Commissioners. We say that a Part 3 application should be case managed and directed to achieve the purpose of remitting the hardship that has been identified arising from the foreign financial order. And this is something that Mr Justice Munby addressed and dealt with, and he imposed, as he could do, as you remember under section 13(3), stringent conditions as to how the case was to be run at the final hearing. And if we could read on, please, to paragraph 61 of his judgement, I think you still have the page open, he says, so in principle, and despite everything said by Mr Mitchell, I accept that the wife should have leave to make her claim. In saying this, I have, of course, had regard to each and every one of the various factors referred to in section 16(2) of the Act, but this is subject to one very important qualification. There is, as it seems to me, very considerable force indeed, in Mr Mitchell's submission that the husband should not be exposed to the kind of extensive and no doubt expensive proceedings which the wife apparently has in mind. In my judgement, this is a case where it can be can now be seen, even if it was less obvious when the matter was first before me, that I should attach conditions, stringent conditions, to my grant of leave. I'm not prepared to contemplate a rerun of the Nigerian proceedings. I am not prepared to contemplate the reopening of factual issues which have been the subject of decision by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay. I am not prepared to contemplate a process involving extensive further evidence, questionnaires and disclosure, nor do I think there is any need for further evaluation or other evidence in relation to the conditional value of the various Nigerian properties. The court already has enough information on these topics to enable it to do proper justice in a fair and proportionate manner, not least bearing in mind that I propose also to impose a condition limiting the wife's property claims to the Barnett property, that's 27 Litton Road. By this, I mean a condition preventing the wife making any claim, whether a proprietary claim, or a claim for property adjustment, or a claim for any other form of transfer, or vesting of property order, to or in relation to any real property, whether in this country or in Nigeria. Saving except only for a claim for property adjustment border in relation to the Barnett property. This will not, however, prevent the wife pursuing her claims for a lump sum order and a payments order. I propose, therefore, to make an order dispensing with many of the normal steps in an ancillary relief, including directions designed to ensure that the wife substantive claim can come on for hearing as quickly, and as cheaply as possible. I am quite sure that full justice can be done to both parties at a hearing lasting no more than one day, and in which there is little if any oral evidence. And he also proposed in the final paragraph, as you can see for an appropriate order to be drawn up by counsel, and if necessary for there to be an informal financial dispute resolution hearing before him, to see whether the matter could be settled. And just in terms of that, within a fortnight of his judgement being handed down, the wife made an open offer on the fourth of January of 2007 to accept a transfer of Litton Road, on the basis of no order as to costs, and a clean break. And on the 31st of January of 2007, the husband rejected that proposal, making no counterproposal in reply, and he appealed to the Court of Appeal. So that is why the case took longer to be resolved than Mr Justice Munby had envisaged.

If you have a maintenance order made in a European country and then you make a claim here for maintenance, I accept that there is a prospect that your claim could be struck out because of the prospect of irreconcilable judgments.

[Long pause]. And the other example which I give is where an order had been made in one of the countries, which these days almost all countries in the world, where in one form or another prenuptial agreements are respected either in European countries by -- in the nature of matrimonial property regimes, or in common law jurisdictions where nowadays virtually all common law jurisdictions subject to safeguards do give effect to prenuptial agreements.

The first of those is where there has been -- where the issue of maintenance has been decided in another EU member state or signatory to the Lugano Convention. And we're assuming that what is in issue is maintenance, which it very often is. And certainly it is arguable that the great majority of Part Three cases will reflect maintenance rather than the sharing principle subsequently introduced. Then we would say that where there has been an award of maintenance in another EU member state, then by virtue of the provisions of the Brussels One Regulation and the Lugano Convention -- now I can refer to specific articles if it would be helpful but -- then it is inconceivable that the English court would entertain an application under Part Three, in so far at any rate is that related to maintenance because it would be liable to give rise to an irreconcilable judgement. And indeed, an application under Part Three in those circumstances could probably be struck out. [Pause]. My learned friend referred to the case of Moore, which, of course, My Lord Lord Collins knows very well. And indeed, there's a passage in our printed case, which I attributed to Lord Justice Thorpe but which, on rereading the report, appears more likely to have been written by Lord Collins. But the point in Moore was that no order had been made in Spain, so there was no risk of irreconcilable judgments. But if one had a case where, say, an order for maintenance had been made in France, which again has a limitation, although they're not as brief as the Scottish limitation -- I think it's eight years on the period for which maintenance can be awarded. Then any application under Part Three for maintenance in the wider sense, as explained in Moore could not be sustained, because it would be wholly inconsistent with the fact that an award of maintenance had been made under the regime of another member state.

But there was a property here that the Italian court had not dealt with. Then the wife would be able to apply here under Part Three to deal with the, the property in this jurisdiction. And there would be no risk of conflicting judgments because Brussels One would not apply to her claim in England because it would be a claim dealing with rights in property arising out of a matrimonial relationship.

Because if she's living here, then her needs are going to be assessed on an English standard. So perhaps if we think of just maintenance alone, the law as is it supplied here may be appropriate if we're looking at capital provision. When capital provision already being made to some extent by the foreign order, it may not be so appropriate. In the clip we sent over yesterday, we enclosed a report. It should be the second document in your clip.
20	p3,00:21:47.240,00:23:01.220,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Yes, it would apply, My Lady. It precisely would apply because any attempt to top up the foreign maintenance order by an English maintenance order under Part Three would amount to an irreconcilable judgment, and or, an interference with the substance of the order made in the other member state. [Long pause]. And the other example which I give is where an order had been made in one of the countries, which these days almost all countries in the world, where in one form or another prenuptial agreements are respected either in European countries by -- in the nature of matrimonial property regimes, or in common law jurisdictions where nowadays virtually all common law jurisdictions subject to safeguards do give effect to prenuptial agreements.
20	p2,00:40:17.980,00:41:18.830,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Well again, you can not have any hard and fast rules, and inconceivable is putting it far too high. But if if the wife there was English and she was living with Children in the matrimonial home in England and that property happened to be in the husband's name had been excluded from the pre natural agreement, is she to be barred from applying under Part three, we would submit that that would be an obvious case where the English court would say under Part Three that notwithstanding what's happened in New Zealand, the New Zealand hasn't taking into account the disposition of the matrimonial home and therefore a part three order could be made. So it's getting back to what I said before the short adjournment that what is intended in Part three is a flexible jurisdiction to provide a bespoke solution. Indeed, that was something that was mentioned by Lord Justice Dillon in Holmes and Holmes. It's going to authorities. Volume 1 very briefly.

In the general formulation of the proposed discretion, we think that it should be made clear by express statutory provisions that the object of the discretion is to provide for the quote occasional hard case. We consider, therefore, that the court should be given power to entertain an application for a financial provision or property adjustment order, notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce, if in the light of all the circumstances of the case, and in the particular certain specified circumstances, the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise. Our present inclination is not to favour any requirement that the applicant must establish the facts of the case to be exceptional, since he may well belong to a religious or ethnic group in which it is not uncommon, for example, for a wife should be divorced abroad without having a right to claim financial relief. And if I could just ask you please to turn to page 109, paragraph 66, which is the concluding paragraph of the working paper, just to pick up the point about the condition precedent, the Law Commission has considered whether a Part 3 application could be made if another court in the British Isles have made in order. In other words, if a Scottish court had made an order, could you then come to England for a Part 3 order, and they decided no. And just reading the last paragraph, they said it would nevertheless, in our view, be inappropriate to allow those divorced elsewhere in the British Isles to apply to the courts in England and Wales for financial orders. There will be few, if any, cases in which a person divorced in another part of the British Isles will have suffered 'serious injustice', which we believe it should be necessary to establish as a condition, precedent in the exercise of the powers that we propose.
20	p1,00:10:27.300,00:20:34.350,spk_2,	True	Counsel: They pose the specific question. Should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? The difficulties in the way of reform of the law are thus formidable. They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied for financial relief in the country where the divorce was granted, but either failed to do so or did so, but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate. Correspondingly, the difficulties are least acute in cases where the law of the country where the divorce was granted contained no provision for financially relief in favour of the wife. We think there is little doubt that a wife who is thus unable to obtain any financial relief, should, provided she can establish a sufficient link between the marriage and this country, be eligible to apply for a financial order here. But we have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court to hear applications for financial relief, notwithstanding the existence of a prior foreign decree of divorce, should be exercisable only in such cases and not in cases where the foreign court had made, or could have made a financial order. We are, however, in no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one with which the marriage has much real connection, but there are also subsidiary arguments which seemed to us to support the view that a restriction of this kind would be undesirable. First, injustice could occur if the foreign divorce court, having dealt with part of a wife's claim for financial relief, could not or would not make any order in relation to capital assets in England, and the English court were precluded from making any order because of the foreign court's order. And my lords and my lady, we say that that really strikes at the very heart of this appeal because in the Nigerian court, the position was that they could not make an order to transfer Litton Road to the wife, and nor would they make any order for her to have a settlement of that property either. And as you will see when we go on to look at the statute, the Law Commissioner's view that there should be no restriction was actually enshrined in the statute, specifically in section 13(2), where the statute says that you can make an application, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order for financial provision. The foundation of Part 3 was based on the Law Commissioner's view that a foreign court which had granted the divorce was not necessarily the only court to deal with all issues arising from the divorce, and they came to this decision for for two reasons. First, they recognise the increasing international mobility, which meant that a marriage and the spouses can have connections with more than one jurisdiction and one legal system. Where they married, where they are domiciles, where they are nationals, and where they have lived during the marriage, pre and post separation, and where their assets are located, give them a connection with more than one jurisdiction. And if I could ask you, please, to look at paragraph 27 which is the preceding paragraph to the one that I just referred to, and just starting from the second sentence, it reads. In a world of pure legal analysis, it would no doubt be possible to identify a single system of law with which the marriage was more closely connected than any other. That system could then be regarded as the proper law of the marriage. As such, it would govern the marriage and its consequences. We do not, however, think that this aim can in practise, be achieved at a time when people can travel easily from one country to another. Marriages are increasingly connected with several different systems of law, for example, with the law of the party's nationality or the law of their place of residence, the place where the marriage was celebrated, or even with the law of their religion. In our view, it is unrealistic to suppose that a process of juristic analysis will identify any single right system of law to which all questions relevant to a particular marriage should be referred to the exclusion of all other systems. In this particular case, although it is right to say that during the marriage the parties spent most of their married life in Nigeria, they have a longstanding and enduring connection with this country. This case is a very good example, we say, of the sort of category of case that the Law Commissioners were considering in paragraph 27. There is no right or obvious jurisdiction to resolve all matters that arise in this case, and it's interesting perhaps, to make the point that both parties had jurisdiction to issue a petition for divorce in Nigeria, and in England. That shows the the connection. It is difficult when you look at the background to the case, which I'll come to a bit in more detail in the moment, it's difficult to identify any aspect of the party's lives that did not have a connection with England, from the very beginning. They met here, married here, and the husband still owns two properties here. They are dual nationals, and perhaps the most striking feature of the case, from a financial point of view, is that 75% of the parties' wealth is not in Nigeria, but it's in England. The second reason for the Law Commission as rejecting the principle that only one court should decide all financial matters consequent on divorce, was that the commissioners recognised that an injustice could arise when the foreign court had made an order which was inadequate and produced a serious injustice. This inadequacy could arise in a number of different ways. First, the foreign court might not have extensive powers to make financial orders. It might be only able to make orders for maintenance, as opposed to orders for lump sum or, as we have in this country, property adjustment. Secondly, the foreign court might not have the power to make orders in respect of property, especially immovable property outside its territorial jurisdiction. This meant that a property in England would be outside the ambit, or could be outside the ambit of a foreign order. And also lastly, of significance in this particular case, is that foreign courts do not necessarily have the range of orders that courts can exercise in this country. The range of orders might be very limited, as was the position here where the Nigerian court, it is common ground, only has power to order a settlement of property and not an order for property adjustment, which transfers the ownership of property from one spouse to another. Also underlying the Act was the Law Commissioner's concern about the financial burden that could be thrust on the public purse, if the effect of the foreign order made inadequate provision, and that is referred to not only in the report but also in the working paper. If I could just ask you please to turn back in tab 1 to page 2, it's the second page of the Commissioner's report. They were dealing with a situation where no order had been made by the foreign court. I'm just reading four lines down from the top of page 2. Such a woman may thus face destitution, and her only source of financial support may be supplementary benefit, and if benefit is paid to her, the supplementary benefits authorities will have no legal right to recover the sums paid from the husband, since he will no longer be a 'liable' relative. The fact that the husband lives in this country and has substantial assets here makes no difference to the legal position. And that concern about being a drain on the public part is also a factor in this case because as a result of the Court of Appeal decision, the wife has been deprived of the means to provide a modest property for herself. And if she wants to remain living in London, where she has lived for the last 10 years, she will have to apply for local authority housing, and I will develop this point in due course.
20	p3,00:18:18.140,00:20:57.900,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Just to go back to other situations, leaving aside Scotland, where the award of a foreign court would be unlikely, we say, to be capable of challenge by virtue of a Part Three application, we set out to in our printed case and my learned friend touched on them yesterday. The first of those is where there has been -- where the issue of maintenance has been decided in another EU member state or signatory to the Lugano Convention. And we're assuming that what is in issue is maintenance, which it very often is. And certainly it is arguable that the great majority of Part Three cases will reflect maintenance rather than the sharing principle subsequently introduced. Then we would say that where there has been an award of maintenance in another EU member state, then by virtue of the provisions of the Brussels One Regulation and the Lugano Convention -- now I can refer to specific articles if it would be helpful but -- then it is inconceivable that the English court would entertain an application under Part Three, in so far at any rate is that related to maintenance because it would be liable to give rise to an irreconcilable judgement. And indeed, an application under Part Three in those circumstances could probably be struck out. [Pause]. My learned friend referred to the case of Moore, which, of course, My Lord Lord Collins knows very well. And indeed, there's a passage in our printed case, which I attributed to Lord Justice Thorpe but which, on rereading the report, appears more likely to have been written by Lord Collins. But the point in Moore was that no order had been made in Spain, so there was no risk of irreconcilable judgments. But if one had a case where, say, an order for maintenance had been made in France, which again has a limitation, although they're not as brief as the Scottish limitation -- I think it's eight years on the period for which maintenance can be awarded. Then any application under Part Three for maintenance in the wider sense, as explained in Moore could not be sustained, because it would be wholly inconsistent with the fact that an award of maintenance had been made under the regime of another member state.

20	p2,01:53:57.150,01:56:05.070,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And then over the page at paragraph 51. Having rejected proposals for a rigid bar and applications, we are left with the alternative of a flexible discretion under which, although an application could be presented by any person able to satisfy the jurisdictional test, we have recommended such applications would be the subject of preliminary scrutiny by the court, which would only allow the applicant to proceed if in the circumstances it was thought appropriate to do so in the general formulation of the proposed discretion. And we think that it should be made clear by express statutory provisions that the object of the discretion is to provide for the occasional hard case now pausing there. The statute does not use the phrase occasional hard case or any other equivalent phrase, but by way of guidance as to how the powers conferred by the statute should be exercised. This could not be plainer and the fact that Parliament has not actually included, and it would be somewhat unusual to find words even equivalent to the occasional hard case in a Westminster statute. But this shows just how narrow the mischief was. Just how small is the category of cases in which part three orders should be made and then the test. We consider, therefore, that the court should be given power to entertain an application for a financial provisional property adjustment order notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce if in the light of all the circumstances of the case and in particular certain specified circumstances, the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise. Now again, there is no reference in the statute to serious injustice. But we invite this court to approach the fundamental question raised by the appeal on the basis that the mischief at which the statute was directed was the very narrow one. It was directed at the occasional hard case where serious injustice might arise.

20	p3,01:01:09.910,01:02:55.430,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And then, set out numbers 1 to 8, which echo in almost identical language the paragraphs of Section 25(2) of the 1973 Act so subject to this one difference, which I say is a more technical and formal than real difference. Namely, that the Nigerian court had no power to make ancillary -- to make a transfer of property order, that the statute under which it was operating was remarkably similar to the English statute, indeed was plainly, uh, inspired by and drawn from the English statute at some stage in its evolution. Because the language, the echo of language, can't be a pure coincidence, and that the approach of the Nigerian court was to award the wife a home for her life and a lump sum, which reflected its view of the appropriate level of capitalist maintenance in all the circumstances of the case and subject again to this one difference of the property being settled rather than transferred outright, That is exactly how English courts would approach the vast majority of cases before the decision of the House of Lords in White and White less than 10 years again. And it is quite impossible, we submit, to say that the approach of the Nigerian court was not broadly comparable to that of the English court, which we say is the correct test per M and M, when what it was doing was very, very close to what the English court would have done until less than 10 years ago.

It is thus our view that in some circumstances the court in England should have power to make a financial order in favour of a former spouse whose marriage has been terminated by foreign decree. However, we found considerable difficulty in defining it precisely what circumstances such a power should be exercisable. In our view, the advantage of giving a remedy needs to be very carefully balanced, and not only against the risks of forum shopping. That is a risk that litigants with little on a real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that confer such a power on the courts. Would, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply to the incidence of a particular marriage, those problems which which will be difficult, if not impossible, to solve Could I just say there that the definition which is put forward their for forum shopping is, we would say only one aspect of the possible categories of forum shopping. And that's another aspect of foreign shopping is we say what happened in this case where somebody tries to ride two horses and and then at the bottom of paragraph 20 for the bottom of the page. After dealing with the hypothetical rural Taney. In example, problems could arise even if the wife were able to make a claim of financial relief and in fact did so but either failed to obtain any order or obtained an order which he thought to be inadequate. Should she be able to apply to the English court?

21	p1,00:08:48.540,00:10:26.380,spk_2,	True	Counsel: If I could just refer you please to the very first paragraph, just to set the background as to why the Law Commissioners were involved, and they succinctly state in paragraph 1.1, where a marriage is terminated by foreign proceedings in which no financial order is made, a court in this country has no power to grant financial relief. In recent years, there has been a steady stream of cases coming before the courts, which has both highlighted the gap in the law and illustrated the hardship to which it may give rise. The view is that the law is in need of reform has been widely expressed. The obvious case, or what was known as the paradigm case for reform, was where the foreign jurisdiction had made no order at all in favour of invariably the wife applicant. But there were other cases which caused the Law Commission some concern because there were cases where a spouse had either not made an application for financial relief in the foreign court, even though she could have done so. Or, as in this case, she had made an application to the foreign court and obtained an order which she perceived as being inadequate. And this was a matter that the Law commissioners considered. And if I could ask you please to turn to page 91 in the working paper, paragraph 27.
21	p2,01:47:22.020,01:48:46.770,spk_0,	True	Counsel: But it is a highly relevant matter. Then going on to paragraph 28 under, should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? Um, the difficulties in the way of reform of the law that's formative They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied to financial relief, etcetera, but either failed to do so but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate, um, mhm and then over the page. We have to have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court here applications for financial relief notwithstanding, the existence for prior foreign decree of divorce should be exercisable only in such cases, not in cases where the foreign court had made or could have made financial order. We are, however, no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one that with which the marriage has much real connection. So again, the threads of form, convenience and being picked up again. And the primary reason for including this provision at all is to cater for the case in which a the parties have little or no connection with the country where the divorce has been ordered.
21	p1,00:44:19.790,00:46:30.340,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Section 13 is the filter process. It's the applicant having to apply to the High Court judge for leave to begin an application for financial relief, and in sub-paragraph one will see it reads. No application for an order for financial relief shall be made under this part of this Act, unless the leave of the court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court, and the court shall not grant leave unless it considers that there is a substantial ground for the making of an application for such an order. The subsections that follow are of some importance in this case. Subsection 2 is the one I mentioned earlier, which is statutory recognition for the fact that the court may make a Part 3 order, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order that provided for a payment or transfer of property to the applicant or a child of the family. That permits the dual application, and subsection 3 is also important, as will be developed in due course. Leave under this under this section may be granted subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit. This appeal does not really concern the Ex parte stage because, as your lordships and my lady will know, the husband appealed. Mr Justice Munby's decision not to set aside the Ex parte granted leave, and it was referred to Lord Justice Thorpe on paper who refused the application, and then there was an oral hearing in which my learned friend appeared before Lord Justice Warren Wilson, who dismissed the application and gave judgments. I don't want to spend too much time on this, although I would like to just briefly refer you to the leading case of Holmes because it is relevant to some extent, to our appeal.
21	p3,00:27:25.740,00:28:16.110,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Mr. Holman submitted to us that the mischief that the act of 1984 was designed to address did not include the case for foreign court of competent jurisdiction making an order which was neither appealed, nor impugned, where the order was final and designed to create a clean break and where the other spouse had fully complied with the order. Then a few lines down, It is clear from the working paper that the remedy to be provided was to be in those exceptional cases where spouses, usually a wife, had been deprived of financial relief in circumstances where an English court might be driven to hold that it would be unjust to recognise the limiting effect of the foreign decree. The Law Commission considered the mischief at which the legislation should be directed to be a narrow one and did not think it would be appropriate to encourage applications to the Courts of this country, inviting them to act in effect as a Court of Appeal from the courts of another country.
21	p1,00:37:35.830,00:40:21.830,spk_2,	True	Counsel: We can see how they expected the new regime to operate. Paragraph 51. Having rejected proposals for a rigid bar on applications, we are left with the alternative of a flexible discretion under which, although an application could be presented by any person able to satisfy the jurisdictional test that we have recommended, such applications would be the subject of preliminary scrutiny by the court, which would only allow the applicant to proceed if, in the circumstances, it was thought appropriate to do so. In the general formulation of the proposed discretion, we think that it should be made clear by express statutory provisions that the object of the discretion is to provide for the quote occasional hard case. We consider, therefore, that the court should be given power to entertain an application for a financial provision or property adjustment order, notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce, if in the light of all the circumstances of the case, and in the particular certain specified circumstances, the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise. Our present inclination is not to favour any requirement that the applicant must establish the facts of the case to be exceptional, since he may well belong to a religious or ethnic group in which it is not uncommon, for example, for a wife should be divorced abroad without having a right to claim financial relief. And if I could just ask you please to turn to page 109, paragraph 66, which is the concluding paragraph of the working paper, just to pick up the point about the condition precedent, the Law Commission has considered whether a Part 3 application could be made if another court in the British Isles have made in order. In other words, if a Scottish court had made an order, could you then come to England for a Part 3 order, and they decided no. And just reading the last paragraph, they said it would nevertheless, in our view, be inappropriate to allow those divorced elsewhere in the British Isles to apply to the courts in England and Wales for financial orders. There will be few, if any, cases in which a person divorced in another part of the British Isles will have suffered 'serious injustice', which we believe it should be necessary to establish as a condition, precedent in the exercise of the powers that we propose.

21	p2,01:51:02.060,01:51:28.190,spk_0,	True	Counsel: My Lords, if we look at paragraph 30, that although law commission says it would be inappropriate to establish a rigid on the court hearing applications merely because of foreign court has made or could have made a financial order. We think it better to seek some other way of minimising the difficulties with which the courts might be faced if they were to have a general and unrestricted power to make financial orders notwithstanding the existence for foreign degree. So it's plainly presupposing that in this category of cases, the approach should be a narrow one.
21	p1,00:02:06.220,00:06:04.260,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes. We saw the authors it listed in the report. The two circumstances that the Law Commissioners were addressing were these. Firstly, when a foreign court had made no financial order at all, and secondly, where the foreign court had made a financial order, but that order was inadequate. And this appeal is concerned only with the second category. It is a condition precedent to the exercise of powers under Part 3 that the wife has to show in the circumstances of her case that a serious injustice has arisen. The serious injustice that this wife relies upon is that after a marriage of 32 years, which produced five children of the family and where the assets were around £700,000, the Nigerian court in June of 2005 awarded her a lump sum of £21,000 and a life interest in the house on Tin Can Island in Lagos. This very modest award produced a very significant disparity, or discrepancy, in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife was left in a position in which she did not own any one of the four properties in the case, two of which were in Lagos and two of which were in London. She was only left with a life interest in the property, that it ceased to be her main home in 1999, six years before the Nigerian court had made its order. In 1999, when the marriage broke down, she came to London to live at 27 Litton Road in New Barnet, a property which the husband had owned from 1975, and which had thereafter been used as a base for the family during the marriage. The trial judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, found that these parties had a long standing and enduring connection with this jurisdiction, and on the basis that the wife forfeited her life interest in the Tin Can Island property, in her husband's favour, he made the following order under Part 3. He ordered the Litton Road be sold and that the wife receives 65% of the net proceeds of sale, which was intended on the valuation used in the proceedings to give her about £275,000, which was to be used as follows. £225,000 to buy herself a modest flat in North London, and £50,000 as a cash sum to supplement her income when she is unable to work. The wife is now aged 69. The Court of Appeal allowed the husband's appeal and dismissed the order for financial provision in Toto. As a consequence, the wife would be homeless in this country where she has been a citizen since 1972, and where she has made her home and worked as a carer for the last 10 years. The purpose of Part 3 was to remit hardship arising from the order of a foreign court. Yet, the Court of Appeal have provided an outcome which Lord Justice Ward, who gave the lead judgement candidly admitted, has left the wife in a parlous plight. In making my submissions my lords and my lady, I want to address 5 topics. The first will be the policy issues considered by the Law Commissioners, which are material to this appeal. Secondly, the statutory provisions of part 3.
21	p1,01:57:15.610,01:57:48.640,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The restrictive approach to the provision of further financial relief really comes from what the Law Commission has said about providing for an occasional hard case and remitting hardship, actually seeing that there is a need that needs to be addressed that hasn't been dealt with in by the foreign jurisdiction. That's what informs all these authorities, but it's not consistent with the statutory language, and it's perhaps surprising that the language isn't stricter. 
21	p1,02:13:07.020,02:16:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Dealing with my next section about how Part 3 should be applied, we have already dealt with the problem about the statutory language once the gate is opened and the way the Law Commissioners dealt with the case, and I'd like to make these submissions, that the discretionary powers of the court under Part 3 should be operated, we say, in a flexible way, focused on remitting the hardship and providing a bespoke solution. And that is because the circumstances that will arise in these cases, which involve other jurisdictions, will be so varied in each and every case. It's often said in domestic cases that no two cases are the same and cases are fact specific, and decided on specific facts, and of course that's correct. But in a Part 3 case where there has been a prior financial order, the range of circumstances that the court has to look at under section 16 are very considerable and will vary so much from case to case because you're obviously dealing with different nationalities and different countries. So that's why we say it should be flexible and focused on providing a bespoke solution. And if it's applied within that sort of framework where it's aiming to remit, the hardship that can be identified, then these majority of tags about being a second bite of the cherry really are not that, and if the English court makes an order supplementing the foreign order, in those sort of circumstances, then it would be wrong to characteristics that as being an appeal from the order of the foreign court because my learned friend is going to say we just had a second bite of the cherry. It was all canvassed in Nigeria, and that what Mr Justice Coleridge was doing was the acting as the Court of Appeal on the order made in Nigeria, but we say no, because the whole purpose is a flexible solution aimed at dealing with the injustice that can be seen. And we also submit that when the court considers whether or not it's appropriate to make an order, as part of all the circumstances of the case, it has to consider the impact on the state purse because as a result of a foreign order, a Part 3 applicant may be reduced to being being reliant upon state benefits or having to apply for local authority accommodation. And that is a very relevant factor in most Part 3 cases because the applicant in nine cases out of 10 is going to be here, in order to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements, and his or her target may very well be a property in this country that he or she wants to live in. And we say it is contrary to public policy to cast upon the public person obligation that should really be born within the family. If the means can be found to provide for the wife, then why should the public person have to pay? And that, we say, is a relevant argument when we come to consider comity.
21	p1,00:10:27.300,00:20:34.350,spk_2,	True	Counsel: They pose the specific question. Should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? The difficulties in the way of reform of the law are thus formidable. They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied for financial relief in the country where the divorce was granted, but either failed to do so or did so, but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate. Correspondingly, the difficulties are least acute in cases where the law of the country where the divorce was granted contained no provision for financially relief in favour of the wife. We think there is little doubt that a wife who is thus unable to obtain any financial relief, should, provided she can establish a sufficient link between the marriage and this country, be eligible to apply for a financial order here. But we have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court to hear applications for financial relief, notwithstanding the existence of a prior foreign decree of divorce, should be exercisable only in such cases and not in cases where the foreign court had made, or could have made a financial order. We are, however, in no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one with which the marriage has much real connection, but there are also subsidiary arguments which seemed to us to support the view that a restriction of this kind would be undesirable. First, injustice could occur if the foreign divorce court, having dealt with part of a wife's claim for financial relief, could not or would not make any order in relation to capital assets in England, and the English court were precluded from making any order because of the foreign court's order. And my lords and my lady, we say that that really strikes at the very heart of this appeal because in the Nigerian court, the position was that they could not make an order to transfer Litton Road to the wife, and nor would they make any order for her to have a settlement of that property either. And as you will see when we go on to look at the statute, the Law Commissioner's view that there should be no restriction was actually enshrined in the statute, specifically in section 13(2), where the statute says that you can make an application, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order for financial provision. The foundation of Part 3 was based on the Law Commissioner's view that a foreign court which had granted the divorce was not necessarily the only court to deal with all issues arising from the divorce, and they came to this decision for for two reasons. First, they recognise the increasing international mobility, which meant that a marriage and the spouses can have connections with more than one jurisdiction and one legal system. Where they married, where they are domiciles, where they are nationals, and where they have lived during the marriage, pre and post separation, and where their assets are located, give them a connection with more than one jurisdiction. And if I could ask you, please, to look at paragraph 27 which is the preceding paragraph to the one that I just referred to, and just starting from the second sentence, it reads. In a world of pure legal analysis, it would no doubt be possible to identify a single system of law with which the marriage was more closely connected than any other. That system could then be regarded as the proper law of the marriage. As such, it would govern the marriage and its consequences. We do not, however, think that this aim can in practise, be achieved at a time when people can travel easily from one country to another. Marriages are increasingly connected with several different systems of law, for example, with the law of the party's nationality or the law of their place of residence, the place where the marriage was celebrated, or even with the law of their religion. In our view, it is unrealistic to suppose that a process of juristic analysis will identify any single right system of law to which all questions relevant to a particular marriage should be referred to the exclusion of all other systems. In this particular case, although it is right to say that during the marriage the parties spent most of their married life in Nigeria, they have a longstanding and enduring connection with this country. This case is a very good example, we say, of the sort of category of case that the Law Commissioners were considering in paragraph 27. There is no right or obvious jurisdiction to resolve all matters that arise in this case, and it's interesting perhaps, to make the point that both parties had jurisdiction to issue a petition for divorce in Nigeria, and in England. That shows the the connection. It is difficult when you look at the background to the case, which I'll come to a bit in more detail in the moment, it's difficult to identify any aspect of the party's lives that did not have a connection with England, from the very beginning. They met here, married here, and the husband still owns two properties here. They are dual nationals, and perhaps the most striking feature of the case, from a financial point of view, is that 75% of the parties' wealth is not in Nigeria, but it's in England. The second reason for the Law Commission as rejecting the principle that only one court should decide all financial matters consequent on divorce, was that the commissioners recognised that an injustice could arise when the foreign court had made an order which was inadequate and produced a serious injustice. This inadequacy could arise in a number of different ways. First, the foreign court might not have extensive powers to make financial orders. It might be only able to make orders for maintenance, as opposed to orders for lump sum or, as we have in this country, property adjustment. Secondly, the foreign court might not have the power to make orders in respect of property, especially immovable property outside its territorial jurisdiction. This meant that a property in England would be outside the ambit, or could be outside the ambit of a foreign order. And also lastly, of significance in this particular case, is that foreign courts do not necessarily have the range of orders that courts can exercise in this country. The range of orders might be very limited, as was the position here where the Nigerian court, it is common ground, only has power to order a settlement of property and not an order for property adjustment, which transfers the ownership of property from one spouse to another. Also underlying the Act was the Law Commissioner's concern about the financial burden that could be thrust on the public purse, if the effect of the foreign order made inadequate provision, and that is referred to not only in the report but also in the working paper. If I could just ask you please to turn back in tab 1 to page 2, it's the second page of the Commissioner's report. They were dealing with a situation where no order had been made by the foreign court. I'm just reading four lines down from the top of page 2. Such a woman may thus face destitution, and her only source of financial support may be supplementary benefit, and if benefit is paid to her, the supplementary benefits authorities will have no legal right to recover the sums paid from the husband, since he will no longer be a 'liable' relative. The fact that the husband lives in this country and has substantial assets here makes no difference to the legal position. And that concern about being a drain on the public part is also a factor in this case because as a result of the Court of Appeal decision, the wife has been deprived of the means to provide a modest property for herself. And if she wants to remain living in London, where she has lived for the last 10 years, she will have to apply for local authority housing, and I will develop this point in due course.

22	p1,00:02:06.220,00:06:04.260,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes. We saw the authors it listed in the report. The two circumstances that the Law Commissioners were addressing were these. Firstly, when a foreign court had made no financial order at all, and secondly, where the foreign court had made a financial order, but that order was inadequate. And this appeal is concerned only with the second category. It is a condition precedent to the exercise of powers under Part 3 that the wife has to show in the circumstances of her case that a serious injustice has arisen. The serious injustice that this wife relies upon is that after a marriage of 32 years, which produced five children of the family and where the assets were around £700,000, the Nigerian court in June of 2005 awarded her a lump sum of £21,000 and a life interest in the house on Tin Can Island in Lagos. This very modest award produced a very significant disparity, or discrepancy, in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife was left in a position in which she did not own any one of the four properties in the case, two of which were in Lagos and two of which were in London. She was only left with a life interest in the property, that it ceased to be her main home in 1999, six years before the Nigerian court had made its order. In 1999, when the marriage broke down, she came to London to live at 27 Litton Road in New Barnet, a property which the husband had owned from 1975, and which had thereafter been used as a base for the family during the marriage. The trial judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, found that these parties had a long standing and enduring connection with this jurisdiction, and on the basis that the wife forfeited her life interest in the Tin Can Island property, in her husband's favour, he made the following order under Part 3. He ordered the Litton Road be sold and that the wife receives 65% of the net proceeds of sale, which was intended on the valuation used in the proceedings to give her about £275,000, which was to be used as follows. £225,000 to buy herself a modest flat in North London, and £50,000 as a cash sum to supplement her income when she is unable to work. The wife is now aged 69. The Court of Appeal allowed the husband's appeal and dismissed the order for financial provision in Toto. As a consequence, the wife would be homeless in this country where she has been a citizen since 1972, and where she has made her home and worked as a carer for the last 10 years. The purpose of Part 3 was to remit hardship arising from the order of a foreign court. Yet, the Court of Appeal have provided an outcome which Lord Justice Ward, who gave the lead judgement candidly admitted, has left the wife in a parlous plight. In making my submissions my lords and my lady, I want to address 5 topics. The first will be the policy issues considered by the Law Commissioners, which are material to this appeal. Secondly, the statutory provisions of part 3.

22	p1,01:54:15.640,01:55:23.870,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Mr. Justice Bodey said it seems to me that the English court can be heard to say that although an applicant has just got over the section 16(1) hurdle, nevertheless, it is only appropriate for the English court to intervene with financial relief to the minimum extent necessary, so as to remedy the injustice perceived to exist without intervention. In my view, is it just such a case. Now, that was not based on any other authority, that's Mr Justice Bodey on his own, but it was cited through Mr Justice Coleridge. And if you go back to these, to the bound volume, to Mr Justice Coleridge's at page 68. Sorry. There's an earlier reference. Thank you very much.
22	p2,01:51:49.360,01:53:46.570,spk_0,	False	Counsel: This in our submission is very important paragraph. In considering restrictions on the availability of the powers which we have proposed so to confine relief to those cases with which it is appropriate for the English court to deal, it is important to take a view on the mischief at which the proposed legislation is aimed. In our view, the proposals should be concerned primarily to give a remedy in those exceptional cases where a spouse, usually the wife, has been deprived of financial relief in circumstances where an English court might be driven to hold that it would be unjust to recognise the foreign decree, it follows that we consider the mischief at which the legislation should be aimed to be a narrow one. We do not think in the absence of any international consensus on the principles which would govern financial provision, that the English court should be unnecessarily exposed to the problems to which we have referred above, and we can see from the footnote that those are the paragraphs that we were looking at a moment ago. So in the Law Commission defines the mischief in exceedingly narrow terms but which make perfect sense when one remembers that the genesis of the Law Commission report was the case of Quazi v Quazi. Where the first instance judgment has, I think, taken 14 days. The court taken seven days the House of Lords two days to decide on the non recognition or recognition of a foreign decree when the real issue was whether the wife should be entitled to a share of a semi detached property in Wimbledon. And so the scene against that context, that background then this very narrow mischief makes a lot of sense. And plainly when the where the foreign court has been able to and indeed, in this case has made. Then the category of cases where the English talk to apply the ostensibly wide powers conferred under Section 16 should be treated very narrowly.
22	p3,00:09:24.260,00:11:48.640,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The final point which I would make before going back to the authorities arises out of My Lady's interjection yesterday which, if I may say it was perhaps intended to be expressed in terms of provoked debate, the effect of are we supposed to stand by and allow injustice to carry on? I'm paraphrasing, but your Ladyship did make a comment to that effect. My Lady, that is, in fact, if I may say so, a critically important point, which is actually central to this appeal. But the short answer to the point is that there are, because there are no internationally recognised standards of what is fairness, then the question we would suggest should be reframed as follows: in what circumstances should the English courts take it upon themselves to decide that the decisions of a foreign court are so unjust that the English court should intervene? [Long pause]. And the first, to give some examples of that where we would say the English court either could not or would not intervene, whatever the award of the foreign court was. If we take a fairly typical British ancillary relief case, the case of a family where the husband has a good income, there are young children, the wife has little or no earning capacity, and the only capital asset is a matrimonial home subject to a substantial mortgage. Then, in England, the almost inevitable outcome of that situation is going to be that the wife will receive probably the bulk of such capital as there is, and virtually certainly an open ended periodical payments order. In Scotland, as we have seen from the summary of the recommendations we were looking at a moment ago, her claim for periodical payments would be restricted to three years, and so that by itself, even without straying outside the jurisdiction of this court, we have two different regimes which can produce radically different results on the same set of facts, according to whether the proceedings are brought in England, or in Scotland.

22	p2,01:51:02.060,01:51:28.190,spk_0,	True	Counsel: My Lords, if we look at paragraph 30, that although the law commission says it would be inappropriate to establish a rigid on the court hearing applications merely because of foreign court has made or could have made a financial order. We think it better to seek some other way of minimising the difficulties with which the courts might be faced if they were to have a general and unrestricted power to make financial orders notwithstanding the existence for foreign degree. So it's plainly presupposing that in this category of cases, the approach should be a narrow one.

Yeah, then going on to paragraph 28 under, should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? Um, the difficulties in the way of reform of the law that's formative They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied to financial relief, etcetera, but either failed to do so but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate, um, mhm and then over the page. We have to have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court here applications for financial relief notwithstanding, the existence for prior foreign decree of divorce should be exercisable only in such cases, not in cases where the foreign court had made or could have made financial order. We are, however, no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one that with which the marriage has much real connection. So again, the threads of form, convenience and being picked up again. And the primary reason for including this provision at all is to cater for the case in which a the parties have little or no connection with the country where the divorce has ordered.

I'd like to move on next to why the court of appeal was wrong, and that will obviously incorporate responding to my learned friend's printed case.
22	p1,00:37:35.830,00:40:21.830,spk_2,	True	Counsel: We can see how they expected the new regime to operate. Paragraph 51. Having rejected proposals for a rigid bar on applications, we are left with the alternative of a flexible discretion under which, although an application could be presented by any person able to satisfy the jurisdictional test that we have recommended, such applications would be the subject of preliminary scrutiny by the court, which would only allow the applicant to proceed if, in the circumstances, it was thought appropriate to do so. In the general formulation of the proposed discretion, we think that it should be made clear by express statutory provisions that the object of the discretion is to provide for the quote occasional hard case. We consider, therefore, that the court should be given power to entertain an application for a financial provision or property adjustment order, notwithstanding the existence of a valid foreign divorce, if in the light of all the circumstances of the case, and in the particular certain specified circumstances, the case would otherwise be one where serious injustice might arise. Our present inclination is not to favour any requirement that the applicant must establish the facts of the case to be exceptional, since he may well belong to a religious or ethnic group in which it is not uncommon, for example, for a wife should be divorced abroad without having a right to claim financial relief. And if I could just ask you please to turn to page 109, paragraph 66, which is the concluding paragraph of the working paper, just to pick up the point about the condition precedent, the Law Commission has considered whether a Part 3 application could be made if another court in the British Isles have made in order. In other words, if a Scottish court had made an order, could you then come to England for a Part 3 order, and they decided no. And just reading the last paragraph, they said it would nevertheless, in our view, be inappropriate to allow those divorced elsewhere in the British Isles to apply to the courts in England and Wales for financial orders. There will be few, if any, cases in which a person divorced in another part of the British Isles will have suffered 'serious injustice', which we believe it should be necessary to establish as a condition, precedent in the exercise of the powers that we propose.
22	p1,02:12:01.110,02:12:48.080,spk_2,	True	Counsel: It is intended to alleviate present [inaudible] financial or other hardship or reduce circumstances caused by a seemingly unjust outcome resulting from divorce proceedings in another jurisdiction, where no comparable remedy is now available to the applicant, it is intended to do so in a just and equitable fashion. And we say that is similar to the way Mr Justice Bodey approached the case in S v S by restricting the amount of the award to the minimum necessary to remedy the financial hardship.
22	p1,01:39:02.380,01:39:36.740,spk_2,	False	
23	p1,00:21:54.940,00:27:06.170,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In our view, the advantage of giving a remedy needs to be very carefully balanced, not only against the risks of forum shopping. That is the risk that litigants with little or no real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that to confer such a power on the courts could, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply, to the incidence of a particular marriage, pose problems which it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to resolve. Where we don't need to be concerned about the applicable law in the case because English law is applied, and in Scotland, Scots Law is applied. In order to meet their concerns about forum shopping, the Law Commissioners proposed three specific safeguards. The first, where jurisdictional requirements based on those four divorce proceedings. They considered that the party should, or either of the party should be domiciled in England and Wales, at the time the application was made, or when the foreign divorce order was made or alternatively, either of the parties could be habitually resident in this jurisdiction for a period of 12 months, either before the application was made or the foreign divorce took effect. There is also another basis for jurisdiction, which doesn't apply in this case but I'll mention it anyway, because the wife could have come within this provision had she wanted to. And that provision is that if either of the parties had a beneficial interest in a property that had been a matrimonial home in this jurisdiction, if you invoke that limb of jurisdiction, then the claimant is restricted to the amount of the beneficial interest. In other words, you can't get more than the beneficial interest that's owned by the other spouse. The second safeguard, to guard against forum shopping, was a filter process in the form of an Ex parte application before a High Court judge, for leave to bring the Part 3 application. The purpose of that was obviously to filter out unmeritorious applications before the other spouse was involved in the proceedings. The third safeguard was consideration by the judge of what the Commissioner's described as some specific guidelines, which we will see in due course, because these guidelines became incorporated in section 16, which is the main statutory provisions that we're concerned with in this case. And those guidelines were to assist the court in the exercise of its discretion to determine whether it was appropriate for the English court to make an order, and these guidelines, as we shall see, focus on connection to this jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction in which the foreign divorce was made, and then on financial matters arising in the jurisdictions. There was no issue in this case at any stage about jurisdiction. The wife based her application on her habitual residents here. Of some significance we say, in this case, is the fact that the wife was acquitted of forum shopping. The very feature of the reforms that the Law Commissioners were concerned about. Mr Justice Munby, who dealt with the Ex parte application and then the inter-parties application brought by the husband to set aside the granted leave. On the papers before him, acquitted the wife of forum shopping. If I could ask you please to turn to the bound volume and appendix 1, what I'd like to refer you please to page 45, which is his judgement. It's page 45, paragraph 58, towards the bottom of the page. Little Roman two.

23	p1,01:30:32.320,01:31:30.780,spk_2,	True	Counsel: And then the jurisdictional requirements are more onerous in Scotland because the applicant has to show not only domicile or habitual residence, but also, as you can see under B, that the other party was domiciled or habitually resident at the appropriate time, or owned a property in Scotland. And then when you look at the conditions in subsection 3, it talks about the divorce falls to be recognised in Scotland. The other party to the marriage initiated the proceedings for divorce. The application was made within 5 years. A court in Scotland would have application to entertain an action for divorce and then significantly at E, the marriage had a substantial connection with Scotland. So it's looking at the link to the country where you're making your application. It's not so certainly, these conditions could not be construed as a strict forum non conveniens test.
23	p1,01:29:44.470,01:30:31.370,spk_2,	True	Counsel: You can see the test that is supplied in Scotland. Section 28 deals with circumstances in which a Scottish court may entertain an application for financial provision, and it says where parties to a marriage have been divorced in an overseas country, then subject to subsection 4, below, if the jurisdictional requirements and the conditions set out in subsections 2 and 3, below respectively, are satisfied, the court may entertain by one of the parties for an order for financial provision. And then the jurisdictional requirements are more onerous in Scotland because the applicant has to show not only domicile or habitual residence, but also, as you can see under B, that the other party was domiciled or habitually resident at the appropriate time, or owned a property in Scotland.
23	p2,00:00:43.840,00:01:04.540,spk_2,	True	Counsel: We've made enquiries about the Scottish law issue and we think that will be here for close of play today, if not, it will be available first thing in the morning.

23	p3,01:39:11.960,01:39:53.900,spk_4,	True	Counsel: And then they quote the passage, the important passage that I referred you to yesterday, which is about no one right system of law. They say it would, on the other hand, seldom be difficult to determine whether or not a marriage had a substantial connection with Scotland. We therefore conclude that an action for financial revision after a foreign divorce should be competent only if the marriage has a substantial connection with Scotland. And that was then incorporated in the -- in Part Four as a specific condition in Section 28 of the 1984 Act.

23	p3,01:38:06.020,01:39:11.860,spk_4,	True	Counsel: We considered whether there should be a requirement that the party should have lived in Scotland for a specified number of years during the marriage or for a specified proportion of their married life together, but concluded that any such rule could lead to anomalies. Cases under these provisions are likely to be infrequent, and it would in our view, be sufficient to require that the marriage should have had a substantial connection with Scotland and this is the important passage coming up. We considered whether it be necessary that the marriage was more closely connected with Scotland than with any other country. Such a provision would be very attractive. In theory, there could be little objection from foreign countries if we applied our law on the -- on the financial consequences of divorce in cases, where not only were reasonable jurisdictional requirements satisfied, but also the marriage was more closely connected with this country than with any other country. There would, however, be practical disadvantage. Practical disadvantages. It would not always be easy to determine the country with which the marriage was most closely connected. This point was made in the working paper. 
23	p1,00:43:22.850,00:44:17.220,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes, if we could turn to the statute, please. And if we could start with section 12. Section 12 permits the application for financial relief following an overseas divorce. And you will note that the breadth of the provision was quite wide because either party to the marriage may apply. There is no restriction on the application being made just by the respondent in the foreign divorce. You could actually have a situation where the petitioner in the foreign divorce was able to apply here. I think I'll check this, but I think the position is different in Scotland.

Firstly, when a foreign court had made no financial order at all, and secondly, where the foreign court had made a financial order, but that order was inadequate. And this appeal is concerned only with the second category. It is a condition precedent to the exercise of powers under Part 3 that the wife has to show in the circumstances of her case that a serious injustice has arisen. The serious injustice that this wife relies upon is that after a marriage of 32 years, which produced five children of the family and where the assets were around £700,000, the Nigerian court in June of 2005 awarded her a lump sum of £21,000 and a life interest in the house on Tin Can Island in Lagos. This very modest award produced a very significant disparity, or discrepancy, in the allocation of the assets between the parties. The wife was left in a position in which she did not own any one of the four properties in the case, two of which were in Lagos and two of which were in London. She was only left with a life interest in the property, that it ceased to be her main home in 1999, six years before the Nigerian court had made its order. In 1999, when the marriage broke down, she came to London to live at 27 Litton Road in New Barnet, a property which the husband had owned from 1975, and which had thereafter been used as a base for the family during the marriage. The trial judge, Mr Justice Coleridge, found that these parties had a long standing and enduring connection with this jurisdiction, and on the basis that the wife forfeited her life interest in the Tin Can Island property, in her husband's favour, he made the following order under Part 3. He ordered the Litton Road be sold and that the wife receives 65% of the net proceeds of sale, which was intended on the valuation used in the proceedings to give her about £275,000, which was to be used as follows. £225,000 to buy herself a modest flat in North London, and £50,000 as a cash sum to supplement her income when she is unable to work. The wife is now aged 69. The Court of Appeal allowed the husband's appeal and dismissed the order for financial provision in Toto. As a consequence, the wife would be homeless in this country where she has been a citizen since 1972, and where she has made her home and worked as a carer for the last 10 years. The purpose of Part 3 was to remit hardship arising from the order of a foreign court. Yet, the Court of Appeal have provided an outcome which Lord Justice Ward, who gave the lead judgement candidly admitted, has left the wife in a parlous plight. In making my submissions my lords and my lady, I want to address 5 topics. The first will be the policy issues considered by the Law Commissioners, which are material to this appeal. Secondly, the statutory provisions of part 3.
24	p2,01:42:56.900,01:44:39.320,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Paragraph 22 line 4. It is thus our view that in some circumstances the court in England should have power to make a financial order in favour of a former spouse whose marriage has been terminated by foreign decree. However, we found considerable difficulty in defining it precisely what circumstances such a power should be exercisable. In our view, the advantage of giving a remedy needs to be very carefully balanced, and not only against the risks of forum shopping. That is a risk that litigants with little on a real connection with this country would start proceedings here solely because they would be likely to find it financially advantageous to do so, but also against the related risk that confer such a power on the courts. Would, in the absence of any clear guidance on what law should apply to the incidence of a particular marriage, those problems which which will be difficult, if not impossible, to solve Could I just say there that the definition which is put forward their for forum shopping is, we would say only one aspect of the possible categories of forum shopping. And that's another aspect of foreign shopping is we say what happened in this case where somebody tries to ride two horses and and then at the bottom of paragraph 20 for the bottom of the page. After dealing with the hypothetical rural Taney. In example, problems could arise even if the wife were able to make a claim of financial relief and in fact did so but either failed to obtain any order or obtained an order which he thought to be inadequate. Should she be able to apply to the English court?

24	p3,00:42:45.150,00:44:34.950,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And at paragraph 19 at page 429, Mr Justice Coleridge states that all events on 29 -- 23rd, October 1973, the Johannesburg Divorce Court dissolved the marriage made in order that the defendant forfeit the benefits of community of marriage and that the plaintiff pay maintenance for the said children at £130 a month. That is the only order that has ever been made governing the financial position between the parties prior to the institution of these proceedings. And so the position was that the wife's claims had never been tested. No order had ever been made in favour of the wife in South Africa, so this is perhaps the closest which we come to the court's approach in circumstances where no foreign order has been made because the only order related to the community of property regime and a specific order for the children and in those circumstances, again not surprisingly, Mr Justice Coleridge felt it appropriate to make an order and one sees at paragraph 39 that his approach whilst at this stage, by operation of section 17 and 18, the application becomes in all but name a conventional ancillary relief application set against this very unusual factual background. So in that context, even though it is right for the court to consider the application, is it right to make any order? And if so what? I have to consider all the factors under section 25. And he then proceeds to do so, um, and makes his order and sets out a schedule of the husband's significant assets.
24	p1,01:10:06.560,01:12:01.650,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Can I now turn to please Section 16 of the Act which is the main section under consideration in the appeal? Section 16 incorporates the specific guidelines that the Law Commissioners were talking about, that the judge would consider in the exercise of his discretion. And under Section 16(1), it reads, before making an order for financial relief, the court shall consider whether, in all the circumstances of the case, it would be appropriate for such an order to be made by a court in England and Wales, and if the court is not satisfied that it would be appropriate, the court will dismiss the application. And then in subsection 2, it states the court shall in particular had regard to the following matters. And before we look at those, what the test is setting out in the test of appropriateness is a general consideration of all the circumstances of the case and then the specific matters in subsection 2 A, B and C, which deal with connection to England and Wales, B is connection to, in this case Nigeria. C is connection to any other country which isn't relevant in this case, and then D, E, F and G all deal really with the financial matters arising in each jurisdiction. D doesn't arise here because that concerns an agreement arising in a foreign jurisdiction that would, for example, be if the parties had had a post or prenuptial agreement --
24	p1,00:10:27.300,00:20:34.350,spk_2,	True	Counsel: They pose the specific question. Should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? The difficulties in the way of reform of the law are thus formidable. They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied for financial relief in the country where the divorce was granted, but either failed to do so or did so, but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate. Correspondingly, the difficulties are least acute in cases where the law of the country where the divorce was granted contained no provision for financially relief in favour of the wife. We think there is little doubt that a wife who is thus unable to obtain any financial relief, should, provided she can establish a sufficient link between the marriage and this country, be eligible to apply for a financial order here. But we have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court to hear applications for financial relief, notwithstanding the existence of a prior foreign decree of divorce, should be exercisable only in such cases and not in cases where the foreign court had made, or could have made a financial order. We are, however, in no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one with which the marriage has much real connection, but there are also subsidiary arguments which seemed to us to support the view that a restriction of this kind would be undesirable. First, injustice could occur if the foreign divorce court, having dealt with part of a wife's claim for financial relief, could not or would not make any order in relation to capital assets in England, and the English court were precluded from making any order because of the foreign court's order. And my lords and my lady, we say that that really strikes at the very heart of this appeal because in the Nigerian court, the position was that they could not make an order to transfer Litton Road to the wife, and nor would they make any order for her to have a settlement of that property either. And as you will see when we go on to look at the statute, the Law Commissioner's view that there should be no restriction was actually enshrined in the statute, specifically in section 13(2), where the statute says that you can make an application, notwithstanding that the foreign court has made an order for financial provision. The foundation of Part 3 was based on the Law Commissioner's view that a foreign court which had granted the divorce was not necessarily the only court to deal with all issues arising from the divorce, and they came to this decision for for two reasons. First, they recognise the increasing international mobility, which meant that a marriage and the spouses can have connections with more than one jurisdiction and one legal system. Where they married, where they are domiciles, where they are nationals, and where they have lived during the marriage, pre and post separation, and where their assets are located, give them a connection with more than one jurisdiction. And if I could ask you, please, to look at paragraph 27 which is the preceding paragraph to the one that I just referred to, and just starting from the second sentence, it reads. In a world of pure legal analysis, it would no doubt be possible to identify a single system of law with which the marriage was more closely connected than any other. That system could then be regarded as the proper law of the marriage. As such, it would govern the marriage and its consequences. We do not, however, think that this aim can in practise, be achieved at a time when people can travel easily from one country to another. Marriages are increasingly connected with several different systems of law, for example, with the law of the party's nationality or the law of their place of residence, the place where the marriage was celebrated, or even with the law of their religion. In our view, it is unrealistic to suppose that a process of juristic analysis will identify any single right system of law to which all questions relevant to a particular marriage should be referred to the exclusion of all other systems. In this particular case, although it is right to say that during the marriage the parties spent most of their married life in Nigeria, they have a longstanding and enduring connection with this country. This case is a very good example, we say, of the sort of category of case that the Law Commissioners were considering in paragraph 27. There is no right or obvious jurisdiction to resolve all matters that arise in this case, and it's interesting perhaps, to make the point that both parties had jurisdiction to issue a petition for divorce in Nigeria, and in England. That shows the the connection. It is difficult when you look at the background to the case, which I'll come to a bit in more detail in the moment, it's difficult to identify any aspect of the party's lives that did not have a connection with England, from the very beginning. They met here, married here, and the husband still owns two properties here. They are dual nationals, and perhaps the most striking feature of the case, from a financial point of view, is that 75% of the parties' wealth is not in Nigeria, but it's in England. The second reason for the Law Commission as rejecting the principle that only one court should decide all financial matters consequent on divorce, was that the commissioners recognised that an injustice could arise when the foreign court had made an order which was inadequate and produced a serious injustice. This inadequacy could arise in a number of different ways. First, the foreign court might not have extensive powers to make financial orders. It might be only able to make orders for maintenance, as opposed to orders for lump sum or, as we have in this country, property adjustment. Secondly, the foreign court might not have the power to make orders in respect of property, especially immovable property outside its territorial jurisdiction. This meant that a property in England would be outside the ambit, or could be outside the ambit of a foreign order. And also lastly, of significance in this particular case, is that foreign courts do not necessarily have the range of orders that courts can exercise in this country. The range of orders might be very limited, as was the position here where the Nigerian court, it is common ground, only has power to order a settlement of property and not an order for property adjustment, which transfers the ownership of property from one spouse to another. Also underlying the Act was the Law Commissioner's concern about the financial burden that could be thrust on the public purse, if the effect of the foreign order made inadequate provision, and that is referred to not only in the report but also in the working paper. If I could just ask you please to turn back in tab 1 to page 2, it's the second page of the Commissioner's report. They were dealing with a situation where no order had been made by the foreign court. I'm just reading four lines down from the top of page 2. Such a woman may thus face destitution, and her only source of financial support may be supplementary benefit, and if benefit is paid to her, the supplementary benefits authorities will have no legal right to recover the sums paid from the husband, since he will no longer be a 'liable' relative. The fact that the husband lives in this country and has substantial assets here makes no difference to the legal position. And that concern about being a drain on the public part is also a factor in this case because as a result of the Court of Appeal decision, the wife has been deprived of the means to provide a modest property for herself. And if she wants to remain living in London, where she has lived for the last 10 years, she will have to apply for local authority housing, and I will develop this point in due course.
24	p2,01:47:22.020,01:48:46.770,spk_0,	True	Counsel: But it is a highly relevant matter. Yeah, then going on to paragraph 28 under, should there be a bar in cases where the foreign court has or could have made an order? Um, the difficulties in the way of reform of the law that's formative They are most acute in cases in which the wife could have applied to financial relief, etcetera, but either failed to do so but obtained an order which she regards as inadequate, um, mhm and then over the page. We have to have had to consider carefully whether the power we propose for the English court here applications for financial relief notwithstanding, the existence for prior foreign decree of divorce should be exercisable only in such cases, not in cases where the foreign court had made or could have made financial order. We are, however, no doubt that such a rigid restriction would be inappropriate. Our primary reason is that, as we have seen, the country in which the divorce was granted may well not be one that with which the marriage has much real connection. So again, the threads of form, convenience and being picked up again. And the primary reason for including this provision at all is to cater for the case in which a the parties have little or no connection with the country where the divorce has ordered.

24	p1,01:29:44.470,01:30:31.370,spk_2,	True	Counsel: You can see the test that is supplied in Scotland. Section 28 deals with circumstances in which a Scottish court may entertain an application for financial provision, and it says where parties to a marriage have been divorced in an overseas country, then subject to subsection 4, below, if the jurisdictional requirements and the conditions set out in subsections 2 and 3, below respectively, are satisfied, the court may entertain by one of the parties for an order for financial provision. And then the jurisdictional requirements are more onerous in Scotland because the applicant has to show not only domicile or habitual residence, but also, as you can see under b, that the other party was domiciled or habitually resident at the appropriate time or owned property in Scotland.

24	p1,01:56:08.860,01:57:12.960,spk_2,	True	Counsel: It's not at all. B, there is no distinction in section 18 between how you approach the case, whether or not there has been no financial order abroad or whether there has been a financial order abroad. And there's no distinction as to how you assess the foreign order in terms of the order that you make in England. Once you're through the gates, you can have all the powers that you can make under the domestic legislation in the Matrimonial Causes Act, and you work on the same principles, as you would decide a conventional application. The only exception is if you bring a claim based on there being a beneficial interest in the property here. In other words, if you don't rely on habitual residence or domicile. The restrictive approach to the provision of further financial relief really comes from the, from what the Law Commission has said about providing for an occasional hard case and remitting hardship, actually seeing that there is a need that needs to be addressed that hasn't been dealt with by the foreign jurisdiction.

And then as he goes on over the page to page 112, he said, Coleridge J duly paid his tribute to Mr Justice to Mr Justice Munby's judgment relied upon it for the facts set out and the law. And what worries me [added] it is important to note that the court's repeal upheld this order and its conclusions that there was a very significant risk of real hardship if the court refused to make any provision for this wife and that it would be draconian to shut her out. As I have observed, this virtually amounts to quod erat demonstrandum, now the words in quotation in that passage he attributed to Mr Justice Coleridge. But in fact, he mixed up partly what Mr Justice Coleridge said, and partly what Miss Harris was submitting on behalf of the wife in quite a significant to, quite a significant extent. If you please turn to page 62 and at the same time look at page 65 you will see how the mistake came about.

Um, but when it's justice, Coleridge addressed the threshold question. The battleground seems to have been on whether the wife was genuine in saying, but she had a desire to live in England. English connections is all bona fide, or whether the husband's right in saying this is all a blatant forum shopping. The only reason she's come to England is to shop. We don't find any reference in Mr Justice Coleridge's judgment to questions of hardship getting over that threshold.

In fact, as you would have seen from the Justice Coleridge, there is criticism about whether the procedure is working effectively or not. At page 65 please, in Mr Justice Coleridge's judgement, and if I could ask you please to look at the the top of the page, the second paragraph, Mr Justice Coleridge said the husband's cases as to section 16 is that the parties connection with this country has really subsisted since separation. Mr Scott asked why the husband should be responsible for the wife's choice to live here, at very considerable extra cost. He says this would be grossly unfair on the husband whose own case stroke evidence was that he himself could not afford to reside here. Mr Scott does not shrink from accusing the wife of blatant forum shopping, crawling the globe to obtain a favourable order, and says that this is no more and no less than an appeal from the Nigerian court. He says that it is not appropriate for this court to start meddling in matters already litigated in Nigeria. That this is a black and white case in which the wife should be stopped. If I could ask you please to go down to the bottom of the page, just picking up the the thread of that argument, he says, the parties have a longstanding and real connection with the UK, its culture, and way of life. They are British citizens, all the children are British and were born here. The wife is unquestionably resident here and has strong connections here. She would say that she has been so for a very long time. There are issues as to when the wife came here for the long term, and I have been shown a schedule based on her passport, which I accept. I also accept the wife has spent the vast majority of her time here in the period from 1999 to 2005, she has been in this country now for nearly 10 years. Apart from that, the parties bought two properties here, one in 1975 and one in 2002. The children were all educated here as a result of which they themselves have property here. It was apparent also that each of the children spent at least part of their time here and regarding England as an important part of their lives.

An application was then made and conducted by my learned junior Mr Mitchell to set aside the permission which was given. And we have looked at Mr Justice Mumby's full judgment on that. It was at that point that I became involved in the case and I was asked to advise on the possibility of appealing against Mr Justice Munby's judgment. And I advise that an attempt should be made to appeal with hindsight, with the benefit of having read the hurt and now reread many times the judgments of the Court of Appeal. In this case, I accept fully that that was the wrong course to take. But I take responsibility for that. And I would pray in aid in mitigation, then it in at least one of the very few reported cases, namely Hewittson then and then an order for leave, which had been made, was overturned on appeal. And also I pray in aid that neither Mr Justice Mumby nor on appeal from his judgment, the Court of Appeal treated our approach in trying to set aside leave as one which was inherently undesirable, even though in the event we failed. But I do, except with hindsight, that the approach was not only wrong but that it was in the event counterproductive because what then happened was that Mr Justice Mumby having given a very full and characteristically erudite judgment which was then upheld by the Court of Appeal, where I made the further mistake of seeking to renew the application for leave to appeal orally. And so, although, as my learned friend has pointed out, Lord Justice Ward fell into error in conflating at one point the actual judgment Mr Justice Munby, of Mr Justice Coleridge and the point at which Mr Justice Coleridge was setting out the submissions put before him by counsel. But nevertheless, the general point which Lord Justice Ward was making that Mr Justice Coleridge fell into the trap of thinking that because these earlier judgments have dealt with a number of issues fully, he did not need to deal with them. That general point was a good point and was right. And is part of the reason, my lady going back to your question why Mr Justice Coleridge in this case fell into error.

26	p1,01:44:08.290,01:45:35.300,spk_2,	True	Counsel: It's very difficult to do that, to value the life interest. See My Lord, looking at the disparity here, we say that Mr Justice Coleridge was right to adopt Mr Justice Munby's wrong judgement and to proceed on the basis, in making the substantive order, that the Nigerian ward was inadequate, and that the substantial disparity between the parties justified a further order being made by the English court because he could see and indeed so he found that the wife was going to suffer severe financial hardship if she was going to remain living in this country with an award provided for by the Nigerian court. Mr Justice Coleridge receives quite a lot of criticism from Lord Justice Ward about the fact that he relied upon Mr Justice Munby's judgement, which was a long judgement running to 64 paragraphs, and Lord Justice Lamer in the Court of Appeal, also said, well, the parties will hardly go to thank Mr Justice Coleridge if he was going to descend into the amount of detail again that Mr Justice Munby had embarked on and indeed, the Court of Appeal had embarked on.
26	p2,00:18:17.240,00:21:40.950,spk_2,	True	Mr. Justice Munby said, in the first place I do not think that Mr Mitchell has made good his assertion that the discretion exercised by Mrs Justice Nicole Clay under section 72 of the Nigerian matrimonial causes that was anything like as broad as that which would be exercisable by an English judge under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. On the contrary, the powerful arguments marshalled by Miss Harris strongly suggests to me that it is nothing like so wide and that, at least in relation to Capitol vision, the Nigerian jurisdiction is not fundamentally needs base at all. So it would seem that the wife was driven to litigate in Nigeria if she was to litigate there at all on a narrower and less favourable basis, than would have been the case if she had been litigating in this country. And Lord Justice Wilson at page 56 a few pages on in the Court of Appeal at the hearing of Mr Barges application for permission to appeal against Mr Justice Munby, was of the same view in the middle of paragraph 17 on page 56, he said. However, the analysis of Mr Justice Munby in relation to the way in which that claim was rejected in Nigeria may well prove to be relevant. It is strongly arguable that the claim was not dispatched by redistributive principles at all, whatever their precise nature, but rather by reference to principles, actual ownership to which we were in this jurisdiction were confined prior to the reforms introduced in 1971. Mr Scott submits that such a conclusion cannot be made even on a provisional basis without expert evidence as to the principles of Nigerian law which must have lain behind the Nigerian judge's rejection of the claim. With respect, I reject that submission. In my view, Mr Justice, Munby's recital of the way in which counsel's arguments in Nigeria were cast and the way in which the judge in Nigeria articulated her rejection of the wife's claim enables one provisionally to reach that conclusion. If such a conclusion is valid or arguably valid, then the comments made by Lord Justice Thorpe in Jordan, which the judge cited are in point. It may be that the failure of the wife to achieve transfer of that property in the Nigerian court was a result of the application of principles in no way comparable to those by reference to which we would dispatch such a claim. And in in his printed case, my learned friend has said that the English court made orders similar to the sort of order the Nigerian court made before the changes came in 1971 and that significant disparity between husband and wife in terms of their financial positions after an English ancillary relief order were not uncommon in the past, we submit that those arguments really are merely an exercise in in retrospection, arguing that the wife's award that she obtained in Nigeria would not be out of place in the 1960's is not a constructive way to approach this appeal. Family law, perhaps more than any other branch of the law, has to evolve to meet changing social mores and expectations. In the case of Part 3 we have the increasing mobility of people around the world over the last 25 years.

26	p1,01:48:05.270,01:48:39.000,spk_4,	True	Counsel: Mr Justice Munby should have been asking himself the question whether there were substantial grounds, but in fact, he went much further than that. Mr Justice Coleridge should have been asking himself the question whether it was appropriate, in the light of the section 16(2) factors to make an order. He did that, and in so doing, he incorporated the enormous amount of detail that Mr Justice Munby had gone into in dealing with those factors. Yes, quite so. Between them, they covered all the ground.
26	p1,02:13:07.020,02:16:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Dealing with my next section about how Part 3 should be applied, we have already dealt with the problem about the statutory language once the gate is opened and the way the Law Commissioners dealt with the case, and I'd like to make these submissions, that the discretionary powers of the court under Part 3 should be operated, we say, in a flexible way, focused on remitting the hardship and providing a bespoke solution. And that is because the circumstances that will arise in these cases, which involve other jurisdictions, will be so varied in each and every case. It's often said in domestic cases that no two cases are the same and cases are fact specific, and decided on specific facts, and of course that's correct. But in a Part 3 case where there has been a prior financial order, the range of circumstances that the court has to look at under section 16 are very considerable and will vary so much from case to case because you're obviously dealing with different nationalities and different countries. So that's why we say it should be flexible and focused on providing a bespoke solution. And if it's applied within that sort of framework where it's aiming to remit, the hardship that can be identified, then these majority of tags about being a second bite of the cherry really are not that, and if the English court makes an order supplementing the foreign order, in those sort of circumstances, then it would be wrong to characteristics that as being an appeal from the order of the foreign court because my learned friend is going to say we just had a second bite of the cherry. It was all canvassed in Nigeria, and that what Mr Justice Coleridge was doing was the acting as the Court of Appeal on the order made in Nigeria, but we say no, because the whole purpose is a flexible solution aimed at dealing with the injustice that can be seen. And we also submit that when the court considers whether or not it's appropriate to make an order, as part of all the circumstances of the case, it has to consider the impact on the state purse because as a result of a foreign order, a Part 3 applicant may be reduced to being being reliant upon state benefits or having to apply for local authority accommodation. And that is a very relevant factor in most Part 3 cases because the applicant in nine cases out of 10 is going to be here, in order to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements, and his or her target may very well be a property in this country that he or she wants to live in. And we say it is contrary to public policy to cast upon the public person obligation that should really be born within the family. If the means can be found to provide for the wife, then why should the public person have to pay? And that, we say, is a relevant argument when we come to consider comity.
26	p1,01:49:22.680,01:49:58.440,spk_2,	True	Counsel: You had to have an eye on what would be happening at the final hearing when it was a test of appropriateness. Yes, quite. So my lord, we would say, bearing in mind the the judgements that had preceded him, he was entitled to find that the Nigerian award was inadequate and he was entitled to find that the wife had suffered, or will suffer serious hardship, and he was also entitled to find, as he said, that the parties have a longstanding and real connection with the UK, its culture and way of life.
