1	p3,02:28:36.670,02:29:34.780,spk_2,	True	Counsel: it appears to me that the requirement that a court or tribunal should have full jurisdiction cannot be mechanically applied, with the result that in all circumstances and whatever the subject matter of the dispute, the court or tribunal must have full power to substitute its own findings of fact and its own inferences from those facts for that of the administrative authority concerned. Whether the power of judicial review is sufficiently wide to satisfy the requirements of Article six must, in my view, depend on a number of considerations, including the subject matter of the dispute, the nature of the decision of the administrative authorities, which is in question the procedure, if any, which exists for review of the decision by a personal body acting independently of the authority concerned and the scope of that power of review. In my view, the powers of review of the High Court, when combined with the statutory arrangements under the 1990 Act for appealing against an enforcement notice, satisfy the requirements of Article 61, and it's that passage which then finds its way into the court judgement at paragraph 45.

1	p4,00:22:57.360,00:24:42.540,spk_1,	True	Counsel: When Your Ladyship applied for an extension. Yes. Yes. But I think in a judicial capacity, it's not something that the administrative Court would thank this court for. The point I make is that this argument goes, well, well beyond Part 7 of the Housing Act and could be replicated across the field of public law where the law has been settled since Alconbury. Those are not decisions that need a full fact-finding jurisdiction. Then the final point I'd like to make before I come to Tsfayo is just to stress the point that Mr Arden made, which is that it is necessary for this court to look at the scheme as a whole and not to focus down holy on the individual dispute. And the authority for that is, of course, Wright in the House of Lords and the speech of Lady Hale. And I do rely on that because effectively, the government lost in right because rather than looking at the individual facts and whether there was a breach of Article 6 or a breach of Article 8 on the individual facts, the approach of the House of Lords was to say no, you've got to look at the scheme and if you look at the scheme, it's not compatible. Well, if that applied in right against the government, it must apply here in our favour, in terms of looking not at one factual dispute buried within 1935 but at the nature of the scheme as a whole. So I come then to whether or not Tsfayo and Crompton force this court to depart from Begum and the settled position. And I am, I'm afraid, going to ask you to go back to Tsfayo and to the key.
1	p1,00:26:01.500,00:27:03.020,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Then the authority may notify him that they regard themselves as having discharge their duty under this section. The local authority subsection 6 will cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant ceases to be eligible, becomes homeless, intentionally accepts an offer of accommodation under part 6, or accepts an offer of an assured tenancy or otherwise voluntarily ceases to occupy as his only or principle home. The accommodation made available for his occupation. The authorities should also cease to be subject to the duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequences, refusal and it is right to request the review of the suitability of the accommodation refuses a final offer of accommodation. Under part 6, an offer of accommodation under part 6 is a final offer for the purposes of subsection seven if it's made in writing and states that it is a final offer for the purposes of subsection at 7.
1	p2,00:01:11.740,00:01:55.200,spk_0,	True	Counsel: On the one hand it is made by officers of the authority or, on the other hand, is made by members of the authority we submit, that's not a relevant difference for two reasons. First, officers no doubt, are in practise every bit as much committed to the authority's interests, including the authorities financial interests as members of the authority are. Secondly, homelessness reviews can be considered by a panel of members rather than by an individual officer. The court has seen subsection four of Section 202 of the act that on a request for review being made, the authority shall
1	p1,00:22:01.990,00:25:59.830,spk_1,	True	Court: Part 7? Counsel: Uh, Section 17(5) defines homelessness and threatened homelessness. Uh, Section 176. The meaning of accommodation available for occupation and section 177 deals with whether it's reasonable to continue to occupy accommodation. I think I could go a number of pages forward to page 20 of the extract, a group of sections dealing with applications for assistance in case of homelessness or threatened homelessness. Section 183, the application following provisions of this part apply where a person applies to a local housing authority for accommodation for assistance in explaining it, and the authorities have reason to believe that he is or may be homeless or threatened with homelessness. Section 184 then relates to the inquiry to be made. If there is that reason to believe, then the authorities shall make such enquiries as necessary to satisfy themselves. Firstly, whether he is eligible for assistance and secondly, if so, whether any duty and if so, what duty is owed to him under the following provisions of this part. And then, there's a notification requirement of the outcome and reasons in subsection 3. And then, section 188 at the bottom of page 25 there is an interim duty to accommodate in case of apparent priority need. Section 189 relates to priority needs. The various categories, including it'll be a person with whom dependent children reside or might reasonably be expected to reside covers both present cases and then dealing with the post inquiry situation. The post Interim situation from Section 19 onwards the duties to the person is found to be homeless or threatened with homelessness. First of all, in section one, I know the duty to persons becoming homeless intentionally. So not our case and section 19(1) begin deals with becoming homeless intentionally in section 19(2) duty to persons not in priority need who are not homeless intentionally again not our case, and then section 19(3) is our case - duty to persons with priority need who are not homeless intentionally. This section applies where the authorities are satisfied that an applicant is homeless eligible for assistance has a priority need and they're not satisfied that he became homeless intentionally unless the authority refer the application to another local housing authority doesn't arise here. They shall ensure that accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant. That in our submission is the key provisions they shall secure that accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant and then subsection three The authority are subject to the duty under this section until it ceases by virtue of any of the following provisions of this section and subsection five. The local authorities shall cease to be subject to the duty under the section if the applicant this having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and it is right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation. Secondly, refuses an offer of accommodation. And thirdly, that's an offer of accommodation which the authorities are satisfied is suitable.
1	p1,01:10:09.430,01:13:18.070,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord, it is, of course, an important feature of the statutory scheme that someone who is in priority need and not homeless intentionally, and who is entitled to accommodation, doesn't lose that accommodation because they decline a particular offer of accommodation which they don't regard as being suitable, unless it has, in terms, been drawn to their attention that they will lose the right. So it is important, whether or not a letter of this kind is received. And more generally, Part 7 of the Act relating to duties, the homeless and their entitlements, is very different from Part 6 relating to the regulation of schemes for the allocation of housing and not giving anyone a right to accommodation. My Lord, is it, um, said in this respect, Part 7 of the Housing Act is similar to Section 20, subsection 1 of the 1989 Children Act. Then I respond, "Yes, in many ways it is. And that assists me in that if who is a child is a question of precedent or jurisdictional fact on the construction of the Children's Act. That one has, of course, to look at the construction in our case of the Housing Act. And what, as this court has seen, is in terms of Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. The first gateway question of fact is whether the applicant was informed of the possible consequences of refusal and the right to review. If so, the second gateway question of fact is, did the applicant refuse the accommodation? And then, if both those facts are established, one has the further question, not a question of fact arising, the Runa Begum question, whether the authority is satisfied that the accommodation was suitable. So, if and insofar as the authority is relying on Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. And then the suitability issue. If they're relying on Section 193, subsection 7, then that is exclusively a question of fact. And my Lord, what we say is that these gateway questions of fact or exclusive questions of fact are eminently questions for a court, either as precedent questions or subsequent questions upon review for appeal.
1	p4,01:11:00.870,01:13:50.430,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Fact that the duty may be discharged in different ways, provided always that it is discharged, that does not detract from the right and you do not need a judgement in your favour in order to have achieved the right. A right pursuant to statute is as much a civil right as a right pursuant to a judgement. If statutory rights exist, they do so whether or not a court has declared that they exist or if they've been denied, a mandatory order has been made with respect to them. A court order is not necessary in order for civil rights to crystallise and were the position otherwise, it would be somewhat fortuitous and arbitrary. And the identification of a particular property is not an ingredient of the existence of the right. The right to have accommodation provided or secured for one is itself a discreet right. It's not emasculated as such on account of separate questions that may arise in relation either to the performance of the duty or to the cessation of the duty. And the Part 7, Section 193, Subsection 2 right indeed contrasts in that respect with the non-rights under Part 6 of the same act. And the Part 7 Housing Act scheme, homelessness scheme, is moreover, similar to, rather than different from, cash benefits in having evaluative elements. Of course, if contrary to our submissions, one is looking at the scheme as a whole, then one can indeed point to evaluative elements in the homelessness scheme. But so, too, the housing benefit and other cash benefit schemes contain evaluative elements. By way of example only, housing benefit evaluation includes, considering whether there is a sham arrangement, whether there has been a deliberate deprivation of capital, and evaluation which compares rather with intentionality in the homeless scheme. And I think the one bundle the court hasn't looked at so far is Volume 2, which is
1	p4,00:09:41.740,00:12:40.640,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The local authority, Housing Authority, shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority is satisfied is suitable for him, and the authority notifies him that they regard themselves as having discharged their duty under this section. Now, the first point to make is an obvious one. Unlike Section 20 of the Children Act, Section 193(5) doesn't distinguish between different limbs that might be said, within Article 6 terms, to be discreet questions of fact. You can see that even within Section 193(5), there are certain things that might be argued by lawyers to be discreet. Have you been informed? Did you get the letter? Have you been informed of the possible consequence of refusal? Now, is that a discreet fact? Or is that a judgment? In other words, that becomes: was the letter good enough? So you got the letter, that's not in dispute. But you say that this letter didn't tell me about the possible consequence of refusal. This letter missed the point. So, is that a discreet question of fact? And then, very similarly, of his right to request a review of the suitability, was that sufficiently clear? And then the next bit is if the applicant refuses an offer of accommodation, well, you can see that that could be analysed as a question of fact. Did your letter back refuse the offer, or was it more equivocal? One can see, in particular cases that might arise, and then which the authority is satisfied is suitable for him. Well again, that could be: Did you get the letter? But it could also be questions within the letter as to whether it was clear or not. So, my Lord, in my submission, attempts to try to divide off one particular factual, inverted commas, issue only is going to give rise to a domino effect of other potential factual issues that could be argued to be discreet or in a non-domestic sense conditions precedent. So, in my submission, the statutory scheme, statutory words do not at all support an analysis that there are discrete questions of fact which can be wholly divorced from the rest of the Part 7 decision.

1	p3,00:03:03.660,00:06:09.840,spk_0,	False	Counsel: I reject the submission. The very essence of the right has been impaired. So the concept full jurisdiction accordingly requires the court take the decision of threshold remitted to some other body, fully independent, manifestly impartial. There is no such body at the moment. What Lord Justice Ward is recognising here in our submission is something that's implicit in the European and domestic discussion of the administrative rather than judicial model of decision making and he's spelling that out that it is an administrator's job not to do people out of their rights but to administer their distribution, actually, and at risk of sounding simplistic, trained local authority. Housing officers are, by and large, there to house people. There's no conscious or unconscious intention to approach applicants. Unfavourably to house people is their job, and if anything, one would expect housing officers to lean in favour of applicants. The authorities wider interest is to prevent homelessness, not to generate it. Nor is the spectre of member pressure to be assumed. We're not saying it can never happen. But the reason, if I if I may say this, perhaps a mild tendency in some cases for courts. I dare say this to bring their own experience of local government, to bear, whether drive from practise or otherwise or general knowledge or what have you sometimes without appreciating some of the considerable. Some of us would say seismic changes that have taken place in local government over the last decade or two. In particular. Members are now statutorily required to commit to a code of conduct which has to, and they are disqualified as members if they don't sign up to it after a period of time. The code of conduct has to contain provisions, some of which are mandatory and set by government by statutory instrument, one of which I thought it's worth. And breach of these provisions leads to sanctions not just committee within the authority, but to something called the case tribunal of the Independent adjudication panel for England and can lead again to disqualification as a member. This is all under the Local Government Act 2000, and the reason I mentioned that, if I may is just to finish that point, I confess, I did wonder on the way here whether we should actually have produced this obviously we will produce copies if, well, if its helpful.

1	p1,01:20:07.110,01:23:43.830,spk_1,	True	Council: Therefore its limitations can deal with all these issues, but no further. And so the question in paragraph 8 is this, is this equality, quality rather, review sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 6(1) on the assumption that a civil right is an issue playing that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently credible conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authorities. The question is whether this limitation on the county court judges role deprives him of the jurisdiction necessary. Satisfy the requirements of Article 6(1) in the present context. In approaching this question, I regard three matters as particularly pertinent. First of all, part 7 is only part of a far reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing. Administration of that scheme very largely entrusted to local housing authorities. While the homelessness provisions are intended to assist those individuals who are or may become homeless, there is a wider public dimension to the problem of homelessness. Secondly, although, as in the present case an authority may have to resolve disputes, factual issues, it's factual findings will only be staging posts on the way to much broader judgments which the authority has made in deciding whether it owes the full housing duty to an applicant under Section 193(1), the authority has to be satisfied of 3 matters and not satisfied of another. Under 1937(b), the authority ceases to be subject full housing duty if it is satisfied that the accommodation offered to the applicant was suitable for the applicant and that it was reasonable for him to accept it. Thus, it is the authorities' judgement which matters, and it is unlikely to be a simple factual decision.  Court: Yes. Council: And then thirdly, there's a reference to the review regulations, and over the page of Paragraph 10. It referenced the question of contracting out, whether that be desirable or not, and in paragraph 11 in relation to the requirements of Article 6(1) are supplied to the review by a court that administrative decision made by a body not closed with the independence and impartiality required of Judicial Tribunal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence, as in relation to civil rights, has shown a degree of flexibility in its search for just and workman like submission solutions and then certain recent authorities of particular importance, including Byran in the UK, and Kingsley in the UK amongst others. None of these cases is indistinguishable from the present, but taken together, they provide compelling support the conclusion that in a context such as this, the absence of a full fact finding jurisdiction in the tribunal, which appeal lies for an administrative decision making body, does not disqualify that tribunal for the purpose of Article 6(1). This is a conclusion which I accept more readily because it gives effect to a procedure laid down by Parliament, which should properly operated, ensure fair treatment that such as Runa Begum Then there is the speech of Lord Hoffmann, and I can perhaps pick that up at paragraph 27 on page 445.
1	p1,00:35:40.950,00:38:10.150,spk_1,	True	Court: Well, that takes us into the regulations, does it? Counsel: Yes, because the regulations provide a fairly limited form of review. Its part three of the regulations page three. Court: Which Tab? Counsel: Tab eight, My Lord. Court: Yep. The last tab in the same bundle, Um, and on page 3 of the extra print out is part 3 of the regulations that relate to homelessness. Regulation 6. request for a review and notification of review procedure request for a review under Section 202 should be made to the authority. There's no complication here as to which authority and then sub 2 to accept where a case falls within regulation 7, which isn't relevant for our purposes. The authority for whom a request for a review has been made shall notify the applicant that he or someone acting on his behalf may make representations in writing to the authority in connection with the review. So that's the limit of it at the rate at that stage, namely to make representations and to do so in writing. But then Regulation 8 procedure on a review. The reviewer shall, um, uh, consider any representations made under Regulation 6 and any representations made under paragraph 2. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation of the reviewer considers the deficiency or irregularity in the original decision or in the manner in which it was may, but is minded nonetheless to make a decision, which is against the interests of the applicant on one or more issues. If that is so, then the reviewers shall notify the applicant that the reviewer is so minded. And the reasons why and that the applicant or someone acting on his behalf may make representations to the reviewer orally or in writing or both orally and in writing. So it is still a matter of representations only, but in and only in the subsection two situation at least the representations maybe oral as well as or in stead of and in writing.

1	p3,00:39:15.630,00:40:59.390,spk_4,	True	Court: In a sense, what everybody saw was that if Article six applied and if Article 6 required fact finding powers in the independent and impartial tribunal according to law, Uh, well, then the issue is can one apply section 204 In that way? That's what everybody foresaw. And that is, in a sense, the difference between this situation and the Croydon situation. In the Croydon situation, there was no statutory right of appeal. No process at all. So the only one would have to be by judicial review, which, if required, can be adapted to whatever procedure is appropriate for to determine what it has to determine. In this, we've got a statutory provision that says Question of law, which is why you're saying the only answer is to declare Section 24 incompatible, and then the government can go away and think out whether it wants to set up a specialist tribunal to deal with these things. Some sensible system, rather than clogging up the court or whatever. Um, whereas everybody else is saying, Oh, no, we can in somewhere rather read Section 24 to enable the county court to do what the county court has to do, just as, one did in certain other contexts. We don't have to get into whether this is a precedent fact or not. We don't have to get into all of that. We can just look at Section 4. That is the difference between Croydon and this situation. There is no Section 204.
1	p3,02:09:39.430,02:12:24.970,spk_2,	True	Counsel: No. The point is, all that has to be done is to secure accommodation. It doesn't say the form of the accommodation. It doesn't say the tenure of the accommodation. It doesn't say the location of the accommodation. All those are matters of judgement for the local authority and in my submission that is in very stark contrast to housing benefit in Sofio or to the disability benefit in Veneto. which are simply arithmetical calculations on the financial benefit that accrues once you've got your entitlement. Then, the decision makers simply tops up the elements. And that's in total contrast, in my submission, to the nature of the duty and how it's discharged in section 193(2) and then the third contrast, which again, in my submission, is very great to any social security scheme is the way the duty can be discharged in 193(5) and 7(5). The local housing authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequences of refusal, and of his right to review to request a review, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged that duty under this section and then seven. The local housing authority should also cease to be subject to a duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses a final offer of accommodation under part six. So, my lords, under this scheme, the right is lost. Yeah, if the view is taken that there has been an offer of accommodation which was suitable for him, and that necessarily involves a huge element of judgement discretion. However, you want to put it as to whether a suitable offer was made. There is no equivalent to that in housing benefit. For example, you can only lose your housing benefit if you cease to be entitled because you no longer meet the hard edged criteria, part 7 is completely different.

1	p2,01:29:38.890,01:30:43.070,spk_4,	True	Court: This was all done before the Human Rights Act? Yep. We had a situation, didn't we? In which we got a standard sort of administrative procedure, go along to your local authority, you say I'm homeless, please put me up, local authority makes various decisions by an officer. It's very common in that sort of agency situation to have a review procedure, benefits had that throughout for the purpose of correcting errors, basically. Nothing to do with independence, because, as you rightly pointed out, they were both equally lacking in independence, as such. That doesn't mean to say they lacked impartiality, but they might have lacked independence. Of course, like any other administrative decision, they're subject to judicial review. There was, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr Arden, but there was a stage at which it was argued that the right to be housed as a homeless person actually gave rise to a right in private law. Because it was susceptible to an action for breach of statutory duty, if you were not housed. 
1	p2,00:35:26.640,00:37:04.380,spk_0,	True	Counsel: But it's an expertise issue in two senses. First of all, the question of whether or not something is an expertise issue or not, looked at from the perspective of the judge Shoreditch in the County Court, is that yes, suitability is an expertise issue because the House of Lords in Runa Begum has said that suitability is an issue of that kind. But secondly, it is indeed an expertise issue because the person who is judging whether or not it has been reasonable to refuse an offer or, to put it another way, whether the accommodation is suitable or not, is taking account not only of the particular circumstances of the particular family, but also, in that respect, of the general housing situation in the neighbourhood. What resources are available? What other claims are there by other families made on it? The size of the waiting list? How many other homeless families there are? How many properties there are that are not in tower blocks and all that, which may not be expertise, quite the right word, but it is certainly expert knowledge which the housing officer will have and which even an experienced County Court judge will not have, save anecdotally from previous cases that they tried, it was not the first one.
2	p4,01:11:00.870,01:13:50.430,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The fact that the duty may be discharged in different ways, provided always that it is discharged, that does not detract from the right and you do not need a judgement in your favour in order to have achieved the right. A right pursuant to statute is as much a civil right as a right pursuant to a judgement. If statutory rights exist, they do so whether or not a court has declared that they exist, or if they've been denied, a mandatory order has been made with respect to them. A court order is not necessary in order for civil rights to crystallise. And, were the position otherwise, it would be somewhat fortuitous and arbitrary. And the identification of a particular property is not an ingredient of the existence of the right. The right to have accommodation provided or secure, for one is itself a discreet right. It's not emasculated as such on account of separate questions that may arise in relation either to the performance of the duty or to the cessation of the duty and the Part 7, Section 193, Subsection 2 right indeed contrasts in that respect with the non-rights under part 6 of the same act. And the Part 7 Housing Act homelessness scheme is, moreover, similar to, rather than different from, cash benefits in having evaluative elements. Of course, if contrary to our submissions, one is looking at the scheme as a whole, then one can indeed point to evaluative elements in the homelessness scheme.

And I think the one bundle the court hasn't looked at so far is Volume 2, which is devoted entirely to the housing benefit regulations, I think it's in fact, the current regulations.
2	p3,00:11:39.490,00:13:14.560,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Section 36. And the opinion of affected just refers to the proposition that the distinction between the civil rights, private, and public law has long been abandoned. The concept extended, but with that extension has gone some modification of what article 6 requires and at 44 to 45. Reluctant to accept, Article 6 requires the judicialization of claims to welfare services of this kind. Unlike the arguments based on statutory construction and jurisdictional fact, Mr Howell's argument cannot sensibly distinguish between determination of age and other criteria. Every decision about the provision of welfare services has resource implications for public authority. Public authorities exist to serve the public by reducing, raising and spending public money the officers make. The decisions cannot be regarded as impartial, and the problem cannot be cured by the ordinary processes of judicial review. Based upon the usual criteria of legality, fairness, reasonableness or rationality, tribunals will have to be set up to determine the merits of claims to children’s services and so on. Many more resources we might have spent on the services will be diverted. Conclusion, if not difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with Rina Begum.

2	p3,02:19:51.610,02:20:46.720,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In my submission, if Article six is engaged here, in other words, if it is a civil right, then it is absolutely on the borderline or on the periphery of what is a civil right. And that gives clear indications of the approach that should be taken to whether or not there's a breach of Article six, in other words, to whether or not there is a requirement for a full fact finding appeal mechanism and your lordships have already seen the references in Begum. If I just refer to the paragraphs Lord Bingham made this point at paragraph five and Lord Hoffman at paragraph 34. And as we've seen a moment ago, my Lord Hope, Lady Hale made the same point in Croydon.
2	p3,01:02:22.500,01:05:16.650,spk_2,	True	Counsel: If you go to the top of page 456, in paragraph 67, the whole scheme is shot through with discretions, in which either the council's duty is dependent upon being satisfied of some state of affairs or can be discharged in various ways of its own choosing. By contrast, in Manito, the court said that the management committee of the Local Public Health Service, after verifying that the applicant satisfied the conditions for entitlement to the allowance, should simply have made an arithmetical calculation of the quantum. So, the discretionary elements in Part 7 were, in Lord Hoffman's view, extremely important. And it it's important to recognise the discretionary elements on a whole series of the stages in the Part seven decision making process. And then, in 69, in about the sixth Line, he makes the same point as Lord Bingham. That to accept this case, a part 7 claim, as being a civil right would be to go further than Strasburg has gone. And then in 70 he says he's not going to decide it. Then, looking briefly at the other members of the Judicial Committee, My Lord, Lord Hope at Page 73 agreed with Lord Bingham and Lord Hoffmann. Lord Millett also addressed civil rights in some detail, and the key concluding paragraphs are 90 onwards, where he deals with Silesian, Minuto, and Felder Burger. And at 91 he says the present case undoubtedly goes further. Still, it has four features which take it beyond the existing law. It's benefiting kind. It involves priority between competing claimants for a finite amount of housing stock. Three. The Housing Authority has a discretion as to the manner in which it discharges its duty. And four ultimately, the question for determination calls for an exercise of judgement. And then 92, he analyses those and then, at the end, he says, Rana Begum cannot be said to be claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. He then, to be fair, says in 9(4). But he's persuaded by these considerations are extending the scope of Article 6(1) is a desirable end, but needs to go hand in hand with moderating the requirements in the interests of administration, where administrative decisions are involved and then says in the unsettled light of the case law, content to assume without deciding civil right.
2	p1,01:23:56.180,01:25:48.150,spk_1,	True	Court: Yeah, just refer briefly, if I may, return to 27 but that's really on the point of Independent tribunal. So it is paragraph 28. I returned to the other two issue in dispute, and then refers to how they may relate to each other, referring to a dissenting opinion in Feldbrugge. Then, in paragraph 29 the Strasbourg court has been left to develop the law. It's done so in two ways. First, it's been concerned to ensure that State parties do not exploit the gap left in Article 6 by changing their laws so as to convert a question which would ordinarily be regarded as appropriate in the civil adjudication into an administrative decision outside the reach of the article. It has done this by treating civil rights and obligations as an autonomous concept not dependent upon the domestic law, classification, right, or obligation which the citizens should have access to a court to determine, referring to Goudie in paragraph 30. The second development has been the doctrine, starting with Ringeisen in Austria in 1971, by which the Strasbourg court has extended Article 6 to cover a wide range of administrative decision making on the ground that the decision determines or decisively affects rights or obligations in private law. In a reference to Alconbury and then more recently, the scope of Article 6 has also been extended to public law rights, such as entitlement to Social Security or Welfare Benefit, and the publicly funded statutory schemes on the ground that they closely resemble rights in private law, referring to Salesi v Italy.
2	p2,00:43:44.500,00:44:28.610,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Lords, my Lady, the first point to make is that we make no submissions on issue one in the Court of Appeal. None made on behalf of the authority at all. We support the government's position in the sense that we do not -- we do doubt that our administration of the dispersal of various forms of benefit equivalates to determining civil rights, at least in a traditional understanding of civil rights and local authorities have been tackling issues like homelessness for decades, if not centuries. But really, it seems to us it's not really an authorities business for interest to be engaged in denying rights.

2	p1,01:14:17.210,01:17:46.550,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord, fundamental for present purposes is the materiality of the distinction between on the one hand an administrative decision, which require the exercise by experts as a policy, banks discretion, not the present cases and on the other hand, decisions which as here turn on issues of simple primary fact and no more in the former category. Of course, judicial review or appeal on law only as that concept is conventionally understood will suffice. But not in the latter category. And my Lord, we submit that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum comes within the former category, concerned as it was with suitability of accommodation. My Lord, Runa Begum is in volume 4 of the authorities, at tab 20. The decision was in early 2003. Okay. Yes, my Lord's first at page 438 of the appeal cases report for Runa Begum, paragraph to the parties were agreed that the appeal raised 3 questions which they express in this way was the review officer's decision on protection to to a determination of civil rights within the meaning of Article 61. If so, did she constitute an independent, impartial tribunal for the purposes of that article? If not, the county court on appeal under section 204 possess full jurisdiction so as to guarantee compliance with Article 6(1). And the second of these questions is answered in paragraph three, not independent. That's an integral feature of the scheme. Paragraph 4, one other question inherent in the first question also lends itself to a summary answer. Whether for the purposes of domestic law, Runa Begum enjoyed anything properly recognised as a right, the authorities suggested. No I cannot accept this. Section 193(2) imposed a duty on the authority to secure that accommodation was available for her occupation. This was a duty owed to an enforceable by her, related to a matter of acute concern to her, although Section 26 permitted the authority to performance duty in one of several ways. And although performance calls for the exercise of judgement by the authorities, I think it plain that the authorities duty gave rise to a pluralative in Runa Begum , even though this was not a private law rights enforceable by injunction and damages. The first question differently expressed is whether Runa Begum's right recognised in domestic law is also a civil right with the autonomous right within the meaning of article 6.
2	p1,00:39:22.620,00:43:18.130,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Secondly, Section 193 subsection 2 of the Housing Act confers such a right. Again, not an issue. Thirdly, and again not an issue, that right continues until it ceases by virtue of any of the following provisions of Section 193. And fourthly, we submit this is where one does enter into controversy. We submit that the decision ultimately by the review officer, that the right had ceased with the determination of a civil right for article 6 purposes and that's the nub of the matter for the purposes of the first issue. My Lord's and my Lady, it is well established and not in dispute that is generally sufficient, in order to constitute a civil right for article 6 purposes for there to be an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. So the 6 necessary, and we say sufficient, components of the civil right. First of all, that there is a right. Secondly, that the right is an economic right. Thirdly, that the economic right is an individual right. Fourthly, that the right flows from rules. Fifthly, that those are specific rules. And sixthly, that there are rules laid down in the statute. In our case, shortly stated as we submit that each of those components is manifestly fully satisfied. That looking at the question, whether there is an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute was established as being the appropriate test by the Strasbourg court in cases such as Salesi and Italy and Mennitto and Italy. Cases involving non contributory social welfare benefits as do the present cases and that principle, we say, applies here that the right to accommodation is an individual right as much as any cash benefit. It's an economic right as much as any cash benefit. It flows from specific rules in part 7 of the Housing Act. And we submit the fact that part 7 of the Housing Act may be regarded as part of a scheme of social welfare provision does not affect the salacious classification. Again, it's clearly established by a series of Strasbourg decisions and is not in dispute that the right to a social Security or welfare benefit is, not withstanding its public nature, well capable of being a civil right.

2	p1,01:01:45.110,01:06:50.990,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And indeed, of course, commonly authorities will not actually be providing the accommodation themselves, but will be securing it through nominations to registered social landlords or a variety of means. There are therefore various forms of tenure, which will which will suffice. Um, but it is a tenancy that will be forthcoming. We respectfully submit that the position is as stated by Baroness Hale, then Lady Justice Hale in the Adan v Newham case not the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal. But in our submission the correct view. Well, that's in Volume 3 of the authorities. At the first case in that volume at 10. And Lady Justice Hale's judgement begins at paragraph 52, that page 2136 of the law report. And at the bottom of that page, article 6(1) is set out and then over the top of the next page Miss Booth has accepted for the purpose of this hearing that the determination of an application for accommodation, or for assistance in obtaining accommodation under Part seven, is the determination of his civil rights and obligations. And then continuing, the European Court of Human Rights has held that the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance, including even welfare assistance see Schuler-Zgraggen, see also Feldbrugge and Deumeland. Those cases concern what we would call social security benefits. But the court pointed out that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, the applicant was not only affected in her relations with the administrative authorities as such, but also suffered an interference with her means of subsistence. She was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a case of Germany in a federal statute. And then continuing with the judgement to claim for accommodation under part 7 is also it is accepted for present purposes, such a right once the locals -- and then this is the key passage. Once the local authority are satisfied that the statutory criteria for providing accommodation exists, they have no discretion. They have to provide its irrespective of local conditions of demand and supply, hence this is more akin to a claim for Social Security benefits than it is a claim for social or other services where the authorities have a greater degree of discretion, and resource considerations may also be relevant. Nevertheless, as Miss Booth points out, the nature of the decision making process required by Article 6(1) differs according to the nature of the right being claimed, referring to Albert v Belgium, adopting the concept of full jurisdiction. As Lord Hoffmann explained in Alconbury, subsequent European authorities shows the full jurisdiction does not mean full decision making power. It means full jurisdiction to deal with the case, as the nature of the decision requires. In assessing the sufficiency of the decision making process, under part seven, must be relevant that authorities with all the internal external controls to which they are subject to involved. On the other hand, decisions to house the homeless are quite different. The Secretary of State's decisions and planning and compulsory purchase with which the House of Lords was concerned, and Alconbury in that case, Lord Hoffman drew a distinction between policy decisions with whatever interest requires, which one would expect to be taken by democratically accountable bodies, and the determination of rights and then a short quotation followed by this. Decisions are under part seven of the 1996 Act's and not in any sense policy decisions as to what the public interest requires. And the policy decisions were taken by Parliament when it enacted the 1996 Act. Individual eligibility decisions are taken in the first instance by local housing authorities. But policy questions to the availability of resources or equity between the homeless and those on the waiting list for social housing are irrelevant to individual eligibility. Lords, we respectfully adopt all of that. My Lord, while we have the case to hand later on in the judgement of Lady Justice Hale, her observations, which in our submission are relevant on the question of whether the result with which we contend can be achieved by the means of section 3 of the act.
2	p1,01:20:07.110,01:23:43.830,spk_1,	True	Counsel: There is a question at article 8. Is this Equality -- is this quality rather, review sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 61 on the assumption that a civil right is an issue? Claiming that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently credible conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authorities. The question is whether this limitation on the county court judges' role deprives him of the jurisdiction necessary, satisfying the requirements of Article 6(1) in the present context. In approaching this question, I regard three matters as particularly pertinent. First of all, part 7 is only part of a far reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing, the administration that scheme very largely entrusted to local housing authorities. While the homelessness provisions are intended to assist those individuals who are or may become homeless, there is a wider public dimension to the problem of homelessness. Secondly, although, as in the present case an authority may have to resolve disputes, factual issues, it's factual findings will only be staging posts on the way too much the much broader judgments which the authority has made in deciding whether it owes the full housing duty to an applicant under Section 1931, the authority has to be satisfied of 3 matters and not satisfied of another. Under 1937(b), the authority ceases to be subject full housing duty if it is satisfied that the accommodation offered to the applicant was suitable for the applicant and that it was reasonable for him to accept it. Thus, it is the authorities judgement which matters, and it is unlikely to be a simple factual decision.  Court: Yes.  Counsel: and then thirdly, there's reference to the review regulations, and over the page at Paragraph 10 there's a reference to the question of contracting out, whether that be desirable or not, and in paragraph 11 in relation to the requirements of Article 6(1) are supplied to the review by a court that administrative decision made by a body not closed with the independence and impartiality required of Judicial Tribunal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence, as in relation to civil rights, has shown a degree of flexibility in its search for just and workman like solutions. And then certain recent authorities of particular importance, including Bryan v the UK and Kingsley v the UK amongst others. None of these cases is indistinguishable from the present, but taken together, they provide compelling support the conclusion that in a context such as this, the absence of a full fact finding jurisdiction in the tribunal, which appeal lies for an administrative decision making body does not disqualify that tribunal for the purpose of Article 6(1). This is a conclusion which I accept more readily because it gives effect to a procedure laid down by Parliament, which should properly operated, ensure fair treatment as such in Runa Begum. Then there is the speech of Lord Hoffmann, and I can perhaps pick that up at paragraph 27 on page 445.

2	p1,00:46:02.750,00:47:11.610,spk_1,	True	Court: I mean, is your submission, Mr Golan, your position here, is really no different from what it would be instead of 193 saying they've shall provide suitable accommodation, it said, on these preconditions being satisfied they shall produce £10,000 outright? Counsel: We're saying it's exactly the same. If you were provided with money with a view to it, assisting you with your housing difficulties that would plainly be caught. And in our submission, the fact that we're looking at a benefit in kind rather than a cash benefit doesn't make a difference. And indeed, what we say it comes to is that if the right conferred by Section 193 is a right to a welfare benefit, then the right plainly does fall within Article 6 unless there is sufficient reason to exclude it and that the issue therefore effectively resolves itself into the question, does the fact that Section 193 provides for a benefit in kind a right to accommodation rather than a benefit in cash take it outside the general rule?
2	p1,00:08:40.680,00:12:09.660,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord, certainly, I'm going to come to the question of a practical considerations, which weighed heavily with the Court of Appeal and indeed with the judges in the county court. And my Lord, in our submission, it is a perfectly workable arrangement, if that is what is needed, that one has certain aspects decided in one way and others in another. My Lord, my sixth preliminary point was the well, It's the point that I've made that about-- Court: We've had all that. Counsel: Yes, the seventh is that although, and this is indeed the point that Lady Hale has already raised that, although both the Ali and Ibrahim cases involved the issue of whether a particular letter has been received. Of course, cases that turn only on the resolution of fact can arise in other ways in the homelessness context, of which Tomlinson is an example, and my Lords and my Lady, this leaves 2 areas of major controversy. There is a third area of controversy in relation to remedy, whether it must be a declaration of incompatibility or not. But on the substance of the matter. Two major issues first were the council's adverse credibility findings against both appellants and consequent abandonment of the councils housing duties towards the appellant determinations of civil rights of the appellant's for Article six purposes. That is therefore, the determination not only at rights which plainly they are but of civil rights. We submit that they were civil rights that matters, what the Housing Act conferred, and secondly, if so, does Article six require a full merits review? In our submission, It does, in a case which turns on a simple question of primary fact with no specialist expertise required to determine it and no element of policy or discretion involved in the determination. My Lord, this latter submission, well, the former submission, involves the determination of a case that was not determined as such in Runa Begum, but was the assumption upon which the house proceeded. The latter submission involves either distinguishing or overruling the decision of the House of Lords in the Runa Begum case on suitability of accommodation. My Lord, another way of putting that submission is that it gives effect to the decision of the Strasbourg court in Tsfayo in the UK. And now also, we would say, to the very recent and important decision of the Strasbourg court in Crompton in the UK a decision more recent even than our printed case, my Lord before coming in a moment to the first issue that is determination of civil rights, I should perhaps say a word about the composite expression in Article 6, on the independent and impartial tribunal. 
2	p1,01:17:52.940,01:20:01.620,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord, thus far, I support what the decision says, the reasons that are there given. But then, on the question of civil rights from paragraph five onwards where reference is made to Alconbury, Lord Bingham states at paragraph 6, the European courts approach to rights deriving from social welfare schemes has been complicated by differences of legal tradition in various Member States. As Lord Hoffman explained in Alconbury comparison Feldbrugge in the Netherlands and Deumeland in Germany, and in the 1986 with Salesi and Italy, and Mennitto and Italy, shows movement from a narrower towards a broader interpretation of civil rights. Further cases may no doubt continue that trend, to hold that the right enjoyed by Runa Begum, is a civil right for purposes of Article 6 would, however, to be to go further than the Strasbourg court has yet gone. And I'm satisfied that in the light of a compelling argument on this point by Mr Salesi, the Secretary of State, that the decision of that court would not necessarily be favourable to Runa Begum. So, I prefer to assume without deciding that Runa Begum's domestic law right is also a civil right and to consider whether on that assumption. But having regard to the nature of the right. The statutory provisions of an appeal to the county court on a point of law satisfies the requirements. Article 6, although the county court jurisdictions appellate's substance the same as that of the high Court in judicial review. Thus the court may not only quashed the authority's decision under 243, it's held to be officiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith, but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable, or if the decision maker is shown to have misunderstood or been ignorant of an established, in relevant fact. 
3	p4,00:55:44.170,00:56:02.720,spk_3,	False	Counsel: The technique, of course, that has been employed is accept when it would be incompatible with X's rights under Article six so to confine the appeal. Yes, we've done that on a couple of occasions. But that would simply lead to arguments about what was and was not required by Article six.
3	p1,00:54:04.210,00:55:29.580,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Because the similarity private insurance schemes, sufficiently personal and economic, constitute the subject matter of dispute for the determination of civil rights, see Feldbrugge and Deumeland. However, in the Salesi v Italy judgement Article 6(1) was held by a dispute over entitled to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising the the applicant had an assertive all right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison private insurance schemes and the requirement reform of contract between the individual and the State. In Schuler-Zgraggen, the court held development in the law and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance insurance, including even welfare assistance, then this important passage in paragraph 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the conventions that, the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one of protocol, one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights under Article 6(1). And we would submit, like quite the converse. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation about one of protocol, one which avoids inequalities, treatment based on distinctions, which at the present day, imperial logical or unsustainable.
3	p3,00:44:52.090,00:51:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yeah, my lord. My lady. As your lordship’s know I am going to deal in its entirety with the first issue. Whether it's a civil right, I'm only going to deal with the second issue to the degree to make some supplementary comments, supplementary submissions to my friend Mr Arden's submissions. And then I will deal briefly with the matter of remedy. Where Mr Arden and I disagree, so far as the issue of Is this a civil right is concerned. Just so your lordships know where I'm going. I'm going to deal first fairly quickly with the Strasbourg case law before Begum quickly because it's summarised in considerable depth in Begum. Then I will touch on Begum in relation to the civil rights issue. Then I will deal with the post Begum Strasbourg cases, then the Croydon case and lastly apply the tests to Part 7 of the Housing Act. Um, now in terms of the case law, up to Begum in respect of civil rights. First of all, it's important just to make clear there is no issue here that the claimants had some form of right, um, that's not disputed, and therefore the only question is whether it is a civil right within the meaning of Article 6. And it is, as your lordships will know very well clearly established that a civil right for the purposes of Article 6 is an autonomous concept. In other words, the way that it's described in domestic law is not determinative of whether it's a civil right or not, and again, to state what is certainly well known to my Lady Hale and my Lord I Hope from the Croydon case, Article 6 has extended into what English lawyers would consider two areas extended into what we would call public law in two ways. First of all, there are a series of cases about public law determinations which impact on private law rights, of which the classic examples are licencing. Decisions such as Kingsley planning decisions such as Brian and decisions relating to employment rights such as Albert and Lake Cont and into that category also now falls the case of Crompton, which relates to private law employment rights, albeit with a slight complication that it was a territorial army case. That line of cases in terms of is it a civil right is not what is an issue today. It's the second line of cases where there is a determination of a claim for a Social Security benefit, which is being suggested by my learned friends, has extended into Part 7 of the Housing Act and at that line of cases, really starts with the decision of the European court in a case called Felder Broker, which is in Volume 6 at tab 40. Uh huh and, yeah, Felda Brugger was a case concerning Dutch Social Security benefits, which were contributory benefits. In other words, the claimant had made payments under the equivalent of our national insurance scheme and whether her claim for the benefits fell within the term civil rights for Article 6 and I'll take your lordships in a moment to the key paragraphs. But the point of Felda Burger was that the European Court found that when it was a contributory benefits, it was directly analogous with a private insurance scheme benefit and therefore, in the same way that a private insurance scheme would give you the right to a would give a civil right and therefore Article 6 rights. If it was a contributory scheme, the same analysis must apply, and that's where one gets to Infeld a burger at paragraphs. Key part starts at page 8, paragraph 32. The European Court looks at the features of public law and says in 32 the first such factors as the character of the legislation. The legal rules governing Social Security benefits in the context of health insurance differ in many respects from the rules which apply to insurance in general, which are part of civil war civil law. The Netherlands state has assumed the responsibility of regulating the framework of the health health insurance scheme and overseeing the operation of that scheme. To this end, it specifies the categories of beneficiaries, defines the limits of the protection afforded, lays down the rates of the contributions and the allowances, et cetera, and that last sentence is important because it's picked up later in terms of the need for precise and clear rules. If one is to have an Article 6 civil right, then Paragraph 33 a second factor of relevance is the obligation to be insured against illness or, more precisely, the fact of being covered by insurance in the event of fulfilling the conditions laid down by the legislation. In other words, those concerned can either opt out of the benefits nor avoid having to pay the relevant contributions. And then, in 37 onwards, the court points to the private law features of the right and first of all, the personal and economic nature of the asserted right, a phrase which comes up again and again in the case law to begin with Paragraph 37. Mrs Feldberg was not affected in her relation with the public authorities as such acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, but in her personal capacity as a private individual, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming a right flowing from the specific rules laid down by the legislation in force. For the individual averting it such a right is often a crucial importance. This is especially so in the case of health insurance benefits, when the employee who is unable to work by reason of illness enjoys no other source of income. In short, the right in question was a personal, economic and individual right factor that brought it close to the civil sphere. And they go on in 38 to talk about the relationship with the employment contract, thus tying it in at that stage into private law rights. 
3	p1,01:23:56.180,01:25:48.150,spk_1,	True	Court: Yeah, just refer briefly, if I may, to 27 but that's really on the point of Independent tribunal. So it is paragraph 28. I returned to the other two issue in dispute, and then refers to how they may relate to each other, referring to a dissenting opinion in Feldbrugge. Then in paragraph 29, the Strasbourg court has been left to develop the law. It's done so in two ways. First, it's been concerned to ensure that State parties do not exploit the gap left in Article 6 by changing their laws so as to convert a question which would ordinarily be regarded as appropriate. The civil adjudication into an administrative decision outside the reach of the article has done this by treating civil rights and obligations as an autonomous concept not dependent upon the domestic law, classification, right or obligation, which the citizens should have access to a court to determine, referring to Goudie in paragraph 30. The second development has been the doctrine, starting with Ringeisen in Austria in 1971 by which the Strasbourg court has extended Article 6 to cover a wide range of administrative decision making on the ground that the decision determines or decisively affects rights or obligations in private law. In a reference to Alconbury and then more recently, the scope of Article 6 has also been extended to public law rights, such as entitlement to Social Security or Welfare Benefit, and the publicly funded statutory schemes on the ground that they closely resemble writes in private law, referring to Salesi v Italy.

Certainly, I'm going to come to the question of a practical considerations, which weighed heavily with the Court of Appeal and indeed with the judges in the county court and my Lord the, but in our submission put shortly there is. It is a perfectly workable arrangement, if that is what is needed, that one has certain aspects decided in one way and others in another. My Lord, my sixth. That preliminary point was the well, it's the point that I've made that the about yes, the seventh is that although, and this indeed is the point. Lady Hale has already raised that, although both the Ali and Ibrahim cases involved the issue of whether a particular letter has been received. Of course, cases that turn only on the resolution of fact can arise in other ways. In the homelessness context of which Tomlinson is an example, and my Lords and my Lady, this leaves 2 areas of major controversy. There is a third area of controversy in relation to remedy, whether it must be a declaration of incompatibility or not. But on the substance of the matter. Two major issues first were the council's adverse credibility findings against both appellants and consequent abandonment of the councils housing duties towards the appellant determinations of civil rights of the appellant's for Article six purposes. That is therefore, the determination not only at rights which plainly they are but of civil rights.

Well, this latter submission well, the former submission involves the determination of a case that was not determined as such in Runa Begum, but was the assumption upon which the house proceeded. The latter submission involves either distinguishing or overruling the decision of the House of Lords in the Runa Begum case on suitability of accommodation. My Lord, another way of putting that submission is that it gives effect to the decision of the Strasbourg court in Tsfayo, in the UK and now also, we would say to the very recent and important decision of the Strasbourg court in Crompton and the UK a decision more recent even than our printed case, my Lord before coming in a moment to the first issue that is determination of civil rights. I should perhaps say a word about the composite expression in Article 6, an independent and impartial tribunal.
3	p3,00:11:39.490,00:13:14.560,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And the opinion of affected just refers to the proposition that the distinction between the civil rights, private, and public law has long been abandoned. The concept extended. But with that extension has gone some modification of what article 6 requires and at 44 to 45. Reluctant to accept, Article 6 requires the judicialization of claims to welfare services of this kind. Unlike the arguments based on statutory construction and jurisdictional fact, Mr Howell's argument cannot sensibly distinguish between determination of age and other criteria. Every decision about the provision of welfare services has resource implications for public authority. Public authorities exist to serve the public by reducing, raising and spending public money the officers make. The decisions cannot be regarded as impartial, and the problem cannot be cured by the ordinary processes of judicial review. Based upon the usual criteria of legality, fairness, reasonableness or rationality, tribunals will have to be set up to determine the merits of claims to children’s services and so on. Many more resources we might have spent on the services will be diverted. Conclusion, if not difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with Rina Begum.

Equality is this quality rather review sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 61 on the assumption that a civil right is an issue playing that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently credible conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authorities. The question is whether this limitation on the county court judges role deprives him of the jurisdiction necessary. Satisfy the requirements of Article 61 in the present context. In approaching this question, I regard three matters as particularly pertinent. First of all, part 7 is only part of a far reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing administration that scheme very largely entrusted to local housing authorities. While the homelessness provisions are intended to assist those individuals who are or may become homeless, there is a wider public dimension to the problem of homelessness. Secondly, although, as in the present case an authority may have to resolve disputes, factual issues, it's factual findings will only be staging posts on the way too much the much broader judgments which the authority has made in deciding whether it owes the full housing duty to an applicant under Section 1931, the authority has to be satisfied of 3 matters and not satisfied of another. Under 1937(b), the authority ceases to be subject full housing duty if it is satisfied that the accommodation offered to the applicant was suitable for the applicant and that it was reasonable for him to accept it. Thus, it is the authorities judgement which matters, and it is unlikely to be a simple factual decision. Yes, and then Thirdly, there's reference to the review regulations, and over the page of Paragraph 10 was referenced the question of contracting out, whether that be desirable or not, and in paragraph 11 in relation to the requirements of Article 6(1) are supplied to the review by a court that administrative decision made by a body not closed with the independence and impartiality required of Judicial Tribunal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence, as in relation to civil rights, has shown a degree of flexibility in its search for just and workman like submission solutions and then certain recent authorities of particular importance, including Byran and the UK and Kingsley in the UK amongst others. None of these cases is indistinguishable from the present, but taken together, they provide compelling support the conclusion that in a context such as this, the absence of a full fact finding jurisdiction in the tribunal, which appeal lies for an administrative decision making body does not disqualify that tribunal for the purpose of Article 6(1). This is a conclusion which I accept more readily because it gives effect to a procedure laid down by Parliament, which should properly operated, ensure fair treatment that such as Runa Begum Then there is the speech of Lord Hoffmann, and I can perhaps pick that up at paragraph 27 on page 445.

3	p1,01:14:17.210,01:17:46.550,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord fundamental for present purposes is the materiality of the distinction between on the one hand an administrative decision, which require the exercise by experts as a policy, banks discretion, not the present cases and on the other hand, decisions which as here turn on issues of simple primary fact and no more in the former category. Of course, judicial review or appeal on law only as that concept is conventionally understood will suffice. But not in the latter category. And my Lord we submit that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum comes within the former category, concerned as it was with suitability of accommodation. My Lord, Runa Begum is in volume 4 of the authorities a tab 20. The decision and early 2003. Okay. Yes, my Lord's first at page 438 of the appeal cases report for Runa Begum, paragraph to the parties were agreed that the appeal raised 3 questions which they express in this way was the review officer's decision on protection to to a determination of civil rights within the meaning of Article 61. If so, did she constitute an independent, impartial tribunal for the purposes of that article? If not, the county court on appeal under section 204 possess full jurisdiction so as to guarantee compliance with Article 6(1). And the second of these questions is answered in paragraph three, not independent. That's an integral feature of the scheme. Paragraph 4, one other question inherent in the first question also lends itself to a summary answer. Whether for the purposes of domestic law, Runa Begum enjoyed anything properly recognised as a right, the authorities suggested. No I cannot accept this. Section 1932 imposed a duty on the authority to secure that accommodation was available for her occupation. This was a duty owed to an enforceable by her, related to a matter of acute concern to her, although Section 26 permitted the authority to performance duty in one of several ways. And although performance calls for the exercise of judgement by the authorities, I think it plain that the authorities duty gave rise to a pluralative in Runa Begum , even though this was not a private law rights enforceable by injunction and damages. The first question differently expressed is whether Runa Begum's right recognised in domestic law, also a civil rights in the autonomous meaning given to that expression for purposes of one of the convention.
3	p3,00:55:39.340,00:57:09.460,spk_2,	True	Counsel: As in the two cases previously referred to, other considerations argue in favour of the applicability of Article 61. In the instant case, the most important of these lies in the fact that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, Mrs Salahi was not affected and her relations with the administrative authorities as such. Acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute giving effect to the Constitution. Um, so that's where the law has got to on Social Security benefits, My lords, your lordships, no minuto Is that volume 7 tab 48 but I don't think it's necessary to go to that effectively repeats the Celozzi tasks. And in my submission, what comes out of those tests? Those case law up to that stage is that in order to fall within Article 61, it needs to be an economic and individual right. It needs to be a right flowing from specific rules, and it needs to be a right arising from a scheme where there is no discretion in the method of meeting the right. So just to counter submission, that was certainly made strongly in Croydon. The issue is not whether the right is something that is important to somebody. It might be very important, but that doesn't make it a civil right.
3	p3,01:25:23.210,01:25:51.310,spk_2,	True	Counsel: But, my Lord, I agree with your lordships overarching point. It reads like a decision about the enforcement of judgments against the state and where the state chooses not to enforce a judgement. The European Court will do something about it, and Article 6 is the way to do it. It does not, in my submission, read like a case which is seeking to extend a very precise area of your under article 6, which is subject to a series of well known and often referred to authorities.
3	p1,00:39:22.620,00:43:18.130,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord, that's not an issue. Secondly, Section 193 subsection 2 of the Housing Act confers such a right again, not an issue. Yeah, thirdly, and again, not an issue that right continues until it ceases by virtue of any of the following provisions of Section 193. And fourthly, we submit this is where one does enter into controversy. We submit that the decision ultimately by the review officer, that the right has since with the determination of a civil right for article 6 purposes and that's the nub of the matter. For the purposes of the first issue my Lord's and my Lady, it is well established and not in dispute that is generally sufficient in order to constitute a civil right for article 6 purposes for there to be an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. So the 6 necessary and we say sufficient components of the civil right. First of all, that there is a right. Secondly, that the right is an economic right. Thirdly, that the economic right is an individual, right? Fourthly, that the right flows from rules. Fifthly, that those are specific rules, and sixthly that there are rules laid down in the statute in our case, shortly stated as we submit that each of those components is manifestly fully satisfied, that, looking at the question whether there is an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute was established as being the appropriate test by the Strasbourg court in cases such as Salesi and Italy and Mennitto and Italy. Cases involving non contributory social welfare benefits as do the present cases and that principle, we say, applies here that the right to accommodation is an individual right as much as any cash benefit. It's an economic right as much as any cash benefit. It flows from specific rules in part 7 of the Housing Act. And we submit the fact that part 7 of the Housing Act may be regarded as part of a scheme of social welfare provision does not affect the salacious classification. Again, it's clearly established by a series of Strasbourg decisions and is not in dispute that the right to a social Security or welfare benefit is not withstanding its public nature well capable of being a civil right.
3	p1,01:01:45.110,01:06:50.990,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And indeed, of course, commonly authorities will not actually be providing the accommodation themselves, but will be securing it through nominations to registered social landlords or in a variety of means. There are therefore various forms of tenure, which will which will suffice. Um, but it is a tenancy that will be forthcoming. We respectfully submit that the position is as stated by Baroness Hale, then Lady Justice Hale in the Adan v Newham case, not the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal. But in our submission the correct view. Um, well, that's in Volume 3 of the authorities at the first case in that volume at 10. And Lady Justice Hale. Judgement begins paragraph 52 that page 2136 of the law report. And at the bottom of that page, article 61 is set out and then over the top of the next page miss Booth has accepted for the purpose of this hearing that the determination of an application for accommodation for for assistance in obtaining accommodation under Part seven is the determination of his civil rights and obligations and then continuing. The European Court of Human Rights has held that the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance, including even welfare assistance see Schuler-Zgraggen, see also Feldbrugge and Deumeland . Those cases were concerned what we would call social security benefits. But the court pointed out that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, the applicant was not only affected in her relations with the administrative authorities as such, but also suffered an interference with her means of subsistence. She was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in case of Germany in a federal statute and then continuing with the judgement to claim for accommodation under part 7 is also it is accepted for present purposes, such a right once the locals and then this is the key passage. Once the local authority are satisfied that the statutory criteria for providing accommodation exists, they have no discretion. They have to provide its irrespective of local conditions of demand and supply, hence this is more akin to a claim for Social Security benefits than it is a claim for social or other services where the authorities have a greater degree of discretion and resource considerations may also be relevant. Nevertheless, as Miss Booth points out the nature of the decision making process required by Article 61 differs according to the nature of the right being claimed, referring to Albert v Belgium adopting the concept of full jurisdiction. As Lord Hoffmann explained in Alconbury, subsequent European authorities shows the full jurisdiction does not mean full decision making power. It means full jurisdiction to deal with the case, as the nature of the decision requires. In assessing the sufficiency of the decision making process, under part seven must be relevant that authorities, with all the internal external controls to which they are subject to involved. On the other hand, decisions to house the homeless are quite different. The Secretary of State's decisions and planning and compulsory purchase with which the House of Lords was concerned, and Alconbury in that case, Will Hoffman drew a distinction between policy decisions what interest requires, which one would expect. One would expect to be taken by democratically accountable bodies and the determination of rights and then a short quotation followed by this. Decisions are under part seven of the 1996 Act's and not in any sense policy decisions as to what the public interest requires. And the policy decisions were taken by Parliament when it enacted the 1996 Act. Individual eligibility decisions are taken in the first instance by local housing authorities. But policy questions to the availability of resources or equity between the homeless and those on the waiting list for social housing are irrelevant to individual eligibility. Or we respectfully adopt all of that. My Lord, while we have the case to hand later on in the judgement of Lady Justice Hale observations which in our submission are relevant on the question of whether this can be achieved by section 3 of the act.
4	p4,00:09:41.740,00:12:40.640,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The local authority Housing Authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him, and the authority notify him, that they regard themselves after having discharged their duty under this section. Now, the first point to make is an obvious one. Unlike Section 20 of the Children Act, the section, subsection 1935 doesn't distinguish between different limbs that might be said, we're not talking about domestic precedent fact here, but that might be said within Article 6 terms, somehow to be discreet questions of fact. You can see that even within section 1935, there are certain things that might be argued by lawyers to be discreet. Have you been informed? Did you get the letter? Have you been informed of the possible consequence of refusal? Now, is that a discreet fact? Or is that a judgement? In other words, that becomes: was the letter good enough? So you got the letter that's not in dispute. But you say that this letter didn't tell me about the possible consequence of refusal. This letter missed the point. So is that a discreet question of fact? And then, very similarly of his right to request a review of the suitability, was that sufficiently clear? And then the next bit is if the applicant refuses an offer of accommodation, well, you can see that that could be analysed as a question of fact. Did your letter back refuse the offer, or was it more equivocal? One can see, in particular cases that might arise, and then which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him. Well, I think everybody would agree that was a judgement call and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged their duty. Well again. That could be: Did you get the letter? But it could also be questions within the letter as to whether it was clear or not. So, my Lord, in my submission, attempts to try to divide off one particular factual, inverted commas, issue only is going to give rise to a domino effect of other potential factual issues that could be argued to be discreet or in a non domestic sense conditions precedent. So in my submission, the statutory scheme, statutory words do not at all support an analysis that there are discrete questions of fact which can be wholly divorced from the rest of the part seven decision.
4	p1,01:23:56.180,01:25:48.150,spk_1,	False	Court: Yeah, just refer briefly, if I may, to 27 but that's really on the point of Independent tribunal. So it is paragraph 28. I returned to the other two issue in dispute, and then refers to how they may relate to each other, referring to a dissenting opinion in Feldbrugge. Then in paragraph 29, the Strasbourg court has been left to develop the law. It's done so in two ways. First, it's been concerned to ensure that State parties do not exploit the gap left in Article 6 by changing their laws so as to convert a question which would ordinarily be regarded as appropriate. The civil adjudication into an administrative decision outside the reach of the article has done this by treating civil rights and obligations as an autonomous concept not dependent upon the domestic law, classification, right or obligation, which the citizens should have access to a court to determine, referring to Goudie in paragraph 30. The second development has been the doctrine, starting with Ringeisen in Austria in 1971 by which the Strasbourg court has extended Article 6 to cover a wide range of administrative decision making on the ground that the decision determines or decisively affects rights or obligations in private law. In a reference to Alconbury and then more recently, the scope of Article 6 has also been extended to public law rights, such as entitlement to Social Security or Welfare Benefit, and the publicly funded statutory schemes on the ground that they closely resemble rights in private law, referring to Salesi v Italy.
4	p1,01:36:53.130,01:38:23.730,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Um, well, then one sees that the board didn't have the necessary structural independence. Paragraph 41 therefore there needs to be controlled by a judicial body that provides full jurisdiction. And then there's reference to Bryan and indeed, a quotation from Bryan at the top of the following page planning case pointed out that there are other cases since that followed Bryan in paragraph 44 and then paragraph 45. The domestic courts have also applied the principles in Bryan, notably the House of Lords in planning case or cranberry, and run a big um. In the latter case, the House of Lords found that judicial review of a Housing Officers decision that the claimant had been unreasonable in rejecting the accommodation offered her provided sufficiency of review of Article 6 purposes. House of Lords stressed that although the housing officer had been called upon to resolve some disputed factory issued, those findings of facts were to use the words of Lord Bingham in that case only staging post on the way to much broader judgments concerning local conditions and the availability of alternative accommodation, which the housing officer had the specialist knowledge and experience to make. Although the housing officer could not be regarded as independent, there were safeguards and so forth departure from the procedural rules would have afforded a ground of appeal.
4	p4,00:04:46.440,00:07:49.790,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And then my Lord dealing, going on to deal with breach. What I'm going to do is make a few general points but trying not to cover ground covered by Mr Arden. Then I'm going to deal with the Tsfayo and Crompton, Crompton briefly but Tsfayo in a little more detail because Mr Arden didn't do so. And then I'm going to conclude by just making submissions about those Bryan factors and how they apply to this case. So in terms of the general points, as I said, I'll take it quickly. First of all, in my submission, the issues in the present case were decided in Begum. Although Begum concerned a challenge to a finding on suitability of the accommodation offered, the decision was at the House of Lords was quite explicitly not limited to where cases where the issue was one of judgement alone. And the argument being advanced today by my learned friend Mr Goudie was rejected in terms in my submission in Begum and the references are Lord Bingham at paragraph 10 and Lord Hoffman at paragraph 58. So, in my submission, where that leaves us is either can one draw a distinction on the facts of this case and or do Tsfayo and Crompton force this court to depart from the House of Lords decision in Begum. Dealing with the first of those can one somehow draw a distinction on the facts? In my submission, the answers that plainly has to be no. Part seven of the Housing Act decisions are based on a complicated nexus of facts and judgments, and some of what might be called simple facts then lead into difficult judgments. So there might be facts about whether the lifts work regularly in a block. And that's a classically simple question of fact. How often in the last six months of these lifts broken? It may be critical then to the question as to whether the accommodation is suitable for somebody with two small children who has to carry them up the stairs. Those are exactly the kind of issues that do arise in suitability cases, and in my submission, it is completely unrealistic to try to divide up these issues into fact issues and judgement issues. And to go that way in my submission is to invite absolute chaos and I say that with care in my submission that is not too high absolute chaos in the county court, where some poor judge has to try to make these distinctions.
4	p1,01:17:52.940,01:20:01.620,spk_1,	True	Counsel: thus far, I support what the decision says, the reasons that are there given. But then, on the question of civil rights from paragraph five onwards where reference is made to Alconbury, Lord Bingham states at paragraph 6, the European courts approach to rights deriving from social welfare schemes has been complicated by differences of legal tradition in various Member States. As Lord Hoffman explained in Alconbury comparison Feldbrugge in the Netherlands and Deumeland in Germany in the 1986 with Salesi and Italy, and Mennitto and Italy shows movement from a narrower towards a broader interpretation of civil rights. Further cases made no doubt continue that trend to hold that the right enjoyed by Runa Begum, is a civil right for purposes of Article 6 would, however, to be go further than the Strasbourg court has yet gone. And I'm satisfied that in the light of a compelling argument on this point by Mr Salesi, the Secretary of State, that the decision of this court would not many means necessarily be favourable to Runa Begum so I prefer to assume without deciding that Runa Begum's domestic law right is also a civil right and to consider whether on that assumption. But having regard to the nature of the right. The statutory provisions of an appeal to the county court on a point of law satisfies the requirements. Article 6 although the county court jurisdictions appellate's substance the same as that of the high Court in judicial review. Thus the court may not only quashed the authority's decision under 243, it's held to be officiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith, but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable, or if the decision maker is shown to have misunderstood or been ignorant of an established and relevant fact. Court: This is all fairly familiar stuff, it's describing the nature of the review.
4	p3,02:09:39.430,02:12:24.970,spk_2,	True	Counsel: No. The point is, all that has to be done is to secure accommodation. It doesn't say the form of the accommodation. It doesn't say the tenure of the accommodation. It doesn't say the location of the 10th of the accommodation. All those are matters of judgement for the local authority and in my submission that is in very stark contrast to housing benefit in Sofia or to the disability benefit in Veneto, which are simply arithmetical calculations on the financial benefit that accrues once you've got your entitlement, Then the decision makers simply talks up the elements. And that's in total contrast in my submission to the nature of the duty and how it's discharged in section 1932 and then The third contrast, which again, in my submission, is very great to any social security scheme is the way the duty can be discharged in 1935 and 75. The local housing authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequences of refusal and of his right to review to request a review, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged under that having discharged their duty under this section and then seven. The local housing authority should also cease to be subject to a duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses a final offer of accommodation under part six. So, my lords, under this scheme, the right is lost. Yeah, if the view is taken that there has been an offer of accommodation which was suitable for him, and that necessarily involves a huge element of judgement discretion. However, you want to put it as to whether a suitable offer was made. There is no equivalent to that in housing benefit. For example, you can only lose your housing benefit if you cease to be entitled because you no longer meet the hard edged criteria. Part seven is completely different.
4	p1,00:08:40.680,00:12:09.660,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord. Certainly, I'm going to come to the question of a practical considerations, which weighed heavily with the Court of Appeal and indeed with the judges in the county court and my Lord the, but in our submission put shortly there is. It is a perfectly workable arrangement, if that is what is needed, that one has certain aspects decided in one way and others in another. My Lord, my sixth. That preliminary point was the well, it's the point that I've made that the about yes, the seventh is that although, and this indeed is the point. Lady Hale has already raised that, although both the Ali and Ibrahim cases involved the issue of whether a particular letter has been received. Of course, cases that turn only on the resolution of fact can arise in other ways. In the homelessness context of which Tomlinson is an example, and my Lords and my Lady, this leaves 2 areas of major controversy. There is a third area of controversy in relation to remedy, whether it must be a declaration of incompatibility or not. But on the substance of the matter. Two major issues first were the council's adverse credibility findings against both appellants and consequent abandonment of the councils housing duties towards the appellant determinations of civil rights of the appellant's for Article six purposes. That is therefore, the determination not only at rights which plainly they are but of civil rights. We submit that they were civil rights that matters, what the Housing Act conferred, and secondly, if so, does Article six require a full merits review. In our submission, It does, in a case which turns on a simple question of primary fact with no specialist expertise required to determine it and no element of policy or discretion involved in the determination. Well, this latter submission well, the former submission involves the determination of a case that was not determined as such in Runa Begum, but was the assumption upon which the house proceeded. The latter submission involves either distinguishing or overruling the decision of the House of Lords in the Runa Begum case on suitability of accommodation. My Lord, another way of putting that submission is that it gives effect to the decision of the Strasbourg court in Tsfayo, in the UK and now also, we would say to the very recent and important decision of the Strasbourg court in Crompton and the UK a decision more recent even than our printed case, my Lord before coming in a moment to the first issue that is determination of civil rights. I should perhaps say a word about the composite expression in Article 6, an independent and impartial tribunal.

4	p1,01:07:21.180,01:09:13.480,spk_1,	True	Counsel: indeed. And then on paragraph 75 on page 2143. okay, deals with the timing of the Ringeisen case and the Human Rights Act. And then just between F and G, this case would involve interpreting the words point of law arising from the decision. Or, as the case may be, the original decision. That is the words in Section 204 of the Housing Act to include the question whether the decision making process as a whole, complies with article six in the particular circumstances of the case, this seems to me to be plainly a point of law. The court reaches the conclusion. The process will only comply with Article 6 if the court reaches its own conclusion on disputed questions of fact, and it can indeed must give effect to its disposal powers. Under Section 204(3). It's procedural powers under the civil procedure rules so as to make good the deficiency. And then this is taken further paragraph 80. I therefore see the two possibilities as cumulative rather than alternative. I'm prepared to accept that the local authority may choose to contract out some or all of its reviews to a body whose constitution and procedures enabled the decision to comply with Article 6. But if they do not do so and the particular issues in the case require an independent decision, then the court should fill the gap again. We respectfully adopt that. In fact, on the issue of whether the review procedure can be contracted out, which the House of Lords in Runa Begum was rather inclined to think might not be possible. The Court of Appeal has since held it can be done.

It will be arguments about that. Black wasn't suitable for various reasons. And doubtless that's why the review officer focused on that issue. So, yeah, in my submission, Begum, although I freely except it was over to deal with the issue in a great deal of detail and point to a whole series of reasons why to extend civil right to apart seven claim would be to go beyond Strasbourg. I turned them to the post strapped to the post Begum cases. Um, and Reliance is placed by my learned friend Mr Gowdy as it was by Mr Howell in Croydon on that series of Russian and Ukrainian cases, all of which substantially concerned state housing in various forms.
4	p4,00:22:57.360,00:24:42.540,spk_1,	True	Counsel: When Your Ladyship applied for an extension. Yes. Yes. But I think in a judicial capacity, it's not something that the administrative Court would thank this court for. The point I make is that this argument goes, well, well beyond Part 7 of the Housing Act and could be replicated across the field of public law where the law has been settled since Alconbury that those are not decisions that need a full fact-finding jurisdiction. Then the final point I'd like to make before I come to Tsfayo is just to stress the point that Mr Arden made, which is that it is necessary for this court to look at the scheme as a whole and not to focus down holy on the individual dispute. And the authority for that is, of course, Wright in the House of Lords and the speech of Lady Hale. And I do rely on that because effectively, the government lost in right because rather than looking at the individual facts and whether there was a breach of Article 6 or a breach of Article 8 on the individual facts, the approach of the House of Lords was to say no, you've got to look at the scheme and if you look at the scheme, it's not compatible. Well, if that applied in right against the government, it must apply here in our favour, in terms of looking not at one factual dispute buried within 1935 but at the nature of the scheme as a whole. So I come then to whether or not Tsfayo and Crompton force this court to depart from Begum and the settled position. And I am, I'm afraid, going to ask you to go back to Tsfayor.
4	p1,01:20:07.110,01:23:43.830,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And so, the question in paragraph 8 is this. Equality is this quality rather review sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 61 on the assumption that a civil right is an issue playing that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently credible conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authorities. The question is whether this limitation on the county court judges role deprives him of the jurisdiction necessary. Satisfy the requirements of Article 61 in the present context. In approaching this question, I regard three matters as particularly pertinent. First of all, part 7 is only part of a far reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing administration that scheme very largely entrusted to local housing authorities. While the homelessness provisions are intended to assist those individuals who are or may become homeless, there is a wider public dimension to the problem of homelessness. Secondly, although, as in the present case an authority may have to resolve disputes, factual issues, it's factual findings will only be staging posts on the way too much the much broader judgments which the authority has made in deciding whether it owes the full housing duty to an applicant under Section 1931, the authority has to be satisfied of 3 matters and not satisfied of another. Under 1937(b), the authority ceases to be subject full housing duty if it is satisfied that the accommodation offered to the applicant was suitable for the applicant and that it was reasonable for him to accept it. Thus, it is the authorities judgement which matters, and it is unlikely to be a simple factual decision. Yes, and then Thirdly, there's reference to the review regulations, and over the page of Paragraph 10 was referenced the question of contracting out, whether that be desirable or not, and in paragraph 11 in relation to the requirements of Article 6(1) are supplied to the review by a court that administrative decision made by a body not closed with the independence and impartiality required of Judicial Tribunal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence, as in relation to civil rights, has shown a degree of flexibility in its search for just and workman like submission solutions and then certain recent authorities of particular importance, including Byran and the UK and Kingsley in the UK amongst others. None of these cases is indistinguishable from the present, but taken together, they provide compelling support the conclusion that in a context such as this, the absence of a full fact finding jurisdiction in the tribunal, which appeal lies for an administrative decision making body does not disqualify that tribunal for the purpose of Article 6(1). This is a conclusion which I accept more readily because it gives effect to a procedure laid down by Parliament, which should properly operated, ensure fair treatment that such as Runa Begum Then there is the speech of Lord Hoffmann, and I can perhaps pick that up at paragraph 27 on page 445.
4	p1,01:58:57.580,02:00:41.530,spk_1,	True	Counsel: So, yes, there's a financial interest. But equally, of course, the authority has a financial interest in not being under the the duty to provide the accommodation to secure the provision of the accommodation, which is necessarily an expensive matter, uh, for the authority. And so the interest exists either way around, my Lord. The issue in Runa Begum on the other hand, was whether the accommodation offered was suitable in our submission. That contrast not only with the situation in Tsfayo, whether it was good cause for delay in making the claim, um, but contrast with the present situation and the Lady Hale raised earlier the question of the various factual issues that might arise under the Housing Act. One of those, of course, is whether there's good cause for making an application out of time for the review procedure. In our submission that's very close to the Tsfayo situation would be extraordinary, say the least, if Tsfayo was not to apply to that sort of issue when it arose in the homelessness context as well as the housing benefit context, our submission that simply reinforces true distinction is between the nature of the decision, a decision under consideration and what was an issue, not the separate scheme, and that in our case, the point is even stronger than would delay. Namely, were letters received the appeals, therefore not merely on the Tsfayo side of the line. Runa Begum side of the line.
4	p1,01:10:09.430,01:13:18.070,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And my Lord, It is, of course, an important feature of the statutory scheme. Yeah, that someone who is in priority need and not homeless intentionally and who is entitled to accommodation doesn't lose that accommodation because they decline a particular offer of accommodation which they don't regard as being suitable unless it has, in terms been drawn to their attention that they will lose the right. So it is important whether or not a letter of this kind is received. And more generally, part seven of the act relating to duties the homeless and their entitlements is very different from part six relating to the regulation of schemes for the allocation of housing and not giving anyone a right to accommodation. My Lord is it, um, said in this respect, part 7 of the Housing Act is similar to section 20 subsection 1 of the 1989 Children Act. Then I respond. Yes, in many ways it is. And that that assists me in that if who is a child is a question of precedent or jurisdictional fact on the construction of the Children's Act. That one has, of course, to look at the construction in our case of the Housing Act. And what as this court has seen, is in terms of Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. The first gateway question of fact is what the applicant informed of the possible consequences of refusal and the right to review. If so, the second gateway question of fact is, Did the applicant refused the accommodation? And then it's both those facts are established so that one is through the two gateways. Then one has the further question, not a question of fact arising. The Runa Begum question whether the authority are satisfied that the accommodation was suitable. So if and insofar as the authority is relying on Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. And then the suitability issue. If they're relying on Section 193, subsection seven, then that is exclusively a question of fact. And my Lord, What we say is that these gateway questions of fact or exclusive questions of fact are eminently questions for a court, either as precedent questions or subsequent questions upon review for appeal.

4	p3,02:19:51.610,02:20:46.720,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In my submission, if Article six is engaged here, in other words, if it is a civil right, then it is absolutely on the borderline or on the periphery of what is a civil right, and that gives clear indications of the approach that should be taken to whether or not there's a breach of Article six, in other words, to whether or not there is a requirement for a full fact finding appeal mechanism and your lordships have already seen the references in Begum. If I just refer to the paragraphs Lord Bingham made this point of paragraph five and Lord Hoffman at paragraph 34. And, um, as we've seen a moment ago, my Lord Hope Lady Hale made the same point in Croydon.
4	p4,00:25:08.540,00:31:11.530,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Following on from the submissions I've already made about how one has to look at those Bryan Criteria or those Bryan considerations holistically and together, not separately. In my submission, one has to read the passage in Tsfayo together. What the European court is saying is that if you put these factors together, you get a breach of Article 61. It's not saying each of these factors on their own would necessarily lead to a breach of Article 6. And when, if one just goes to the end of 45, there's consideration of Runa Begum there and in the last sentence, any significant depart from the procedural rules would have afforded a ground of appeal and then the first sentence of 46, the court considers the decision making process in the present case was significantly different and then there are two aspects in which the decision-making process was significantly different. First of all, the aspect in Paragraph 46 which is that the issues raised in Begum and Bryan required professional knowledge of an or expertise, whereas the issues decided by a Housing Benefit review board was a simple question of fact. That was one difference, and then the other difference was in 47. Now my just dealing with 46 first, my learned friend Mr Goudie says, oh, but if there was a breach, Housing Benefit Review boards had all feelings and rights to representation, so if there was a breach there, then that would suggest that the position must be worse under Part 7. But in my submission that does slightly involve taking the perspective of an English lawyer. Strasbourg does not place the same reliance oral hearings as do most of us, probably normally. And what they're saying in 46 and 47 is that Begum had the greater procedural protection precisely because of the impartiality problems that arise on the Housing Benefit Review board. So it's just not like to read 46 47 to suggest that the housing that the European court were thinking well, even though there's all these procedural protections in the Housing Benefit Review board, there's still a problem, ergo under Part seven there would be less of a problem. That isn't the approach the European court have taken at all. And when they talk in 46 about the facts and the good cause being a housing benefit review board deciding a simple question of fact. The contrast there is with the kind of policy decisions which are inherent in the schemes in Bryan and Runa Begum as opposed to the kind of decisions being made under the Housing Benefit Review Board in this particular case, good cause. So Bryan and Begum schemes, replete with policy and judgmental questions and, of course, self evidently, this case is exactly the same as Runa Begum, whereas a Housing Benefit Review board was not a board, not a decision-maker that required any specialist expertise. See the top of page 471. No specialist expertise required to determine this issue, which is under the new system, determined by a non-specialist tribunal. And that's a a factually quite important point about Tsfayo. That, of course, by the time Tsfayo got to the European court effectively paths had been. I was about to say paths has been sold, but the position has been accepted by the UK government because the new housing benefit has been pulled in under the old Social Security Appeal tribunal system. So the anomaly which had existed for years of counsellors deciding housing benefit issues which were exactly the same in many cases as the income support issues, had been swept away. So that's paragraph 46. But it is then important to focus also on paragraph 47. Because 47 is all about impartiality. It's not about independence. The problem was that the European court felt that these counsellors were not impartial. Last sentence of 47. The safeguards built into the housing benefit review procedure were not adequate to overcome this fundamental lack of objective impartiality. Now, whether they were right or wrong in that approach to counsellors isn't really the issue. What matters is that that's what Strasbourg was thinking about and self, evidently by their support for Runa Begum, they did not think that officers of local authorities suffered from the same difficulty. And to some degree, your lordships relationship don't need to grapple with all this today. But in my submission that the approach of the Strasbourg court is not unreasonable on this because contrary to what Mr Goudie said, local authority members and local authority officers are not in the same position. Members are politically accountable, democratically accountable and are associated very closely with the local authority. They are the political limb of the local authority. Whereas employees, we went through this at great length in Croyden, subject to employment contracts. They are neither legally nor in terms of public perception associated with the local authority in the same way that counsellors would be. And they also have their professional expertise to give them the training and the impartiality which might not to be so true
4	p1,01:14:17.210,01:17:46.550,spk_1,	True	Counsel: manner in which the decision was arrived at and the content of the dispute, as the Strasbourg court has made clear. In Bryan and other cases, my Lord fundamental for present purposes is the materiality of the distinction between on the one hand an administrative decision, which require the exercise by experts as a policy, banks discretion, not the present cases and on the other hand, decisions which as here turn on issues of simple primary fact and no more in the former category. Of course, judicial review or appeal on law only as that concept is conventionally understood will suffice. But not in the latter category. And my Lord we submit that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum comes within the former category, concerned as it was with suitability of accommodation. My Lord, Runa Begum is in volume 4 of the authorities a tab 20. The decision and early 2003. Okay. Yes, my Lord's first at page 438 of the appeal cases report for Runa Begum, paragraph to the parties were agreed that the appeal raised 3 questions which they express in this way was the review officer's decision on protection to to a determination of civil rights within the meaning of Article 61. If so, did she constitute an independent, impartial tribunal for the purposes of that article? If not, the county court on appeal under section 204 possess full jurisdiction so as to guarantee compliance with Article 6(1). And the second of these questions is answered in paragraph three, not independent. That's an integral feature of the scheme. Paragraph 4, one other question inherent in the first question also lends itself to a summary answer. Whether for the purposes of domestic law, Runa Begum enjoyed anything properly recognised as a right, the authorities suggested. No I cannot accept this. Section 1932 imposed a duty on the authority to secure that accommodation was available for her occupation. This was a duty owed to an enforceable by her, related to a matter of acute concern to her, although Section 26 permitted the authority to performance duty in one of several ways. And although performance calls for the exercise of judgement by the authorities, I think it plain that the authorities duty gave rise to a pluralative in Runa Begum , even though this was not a private law rights enforceable by injunction and damages. The first question differently expressed is whether Runa Begum's right recognised in domestic law, also a civil rights in the autonomous meaning given to that expression for purposes of one of the convention.
4	p4,00:57:53.030,01:02:02.840,spk_2,	True	Counsel: My Lords, My Lady. The fundamental point we submit on these appeals is that the law has moved on since Runa Begum. The Strasbourg decisions in Tsfayo and now Cromptom strike a rather, if not very different note. My learned friend Mr. Arden relied heavily yesterday afternoon on the speech by Lord Hoffmann in Runa Begum. If, however, one takes Lord Hoffman's approach in Runa Begum in its entirety and applies it to the facts in Tsfayo, then Mrs. Tsfayo loses. But of course, Mrs. Tsfayo, in fact, won. Mr. Arden emphasised in particular, paragraph 56 in Lord Hoffman's speech, and especially the statement that a limited review of the facts is sufficient in those areas of the law. such as regulatory and welfare schemes in which decision making is customarily entrusted to administrators. That approach, applied to housing benefit, would yield the answer that Mrs Tsfayo should have failed. What Lord Hoffman said in that respect is capable of applying every bit as much to housing benefit as to homelessness. But although in Runa Begum, homelessness lost. In Tsfayo, housing benefit won. So assuming Runa Begum, as well as Tsfayo, to be correctly decided, the distinction must be something other than the homelessness scheme on the one hand and the housing benefit scheme on the other hand. The distinction must be the distinction we suggest, made in Tsfayo itself, the distinction between expertise/ discretion issues such as suitability on the one hand and fact issues, on the other hand, such as in both Tsfayo and the present appeals. And indeed, we respectfully suggest that the approach should not be to ask oneself what is the least extent to which one has to chip away from Runa Begum, the approach should be to ask oneself, are the principles in Tsfayo applicable to the present case, or is the present case distinguishable from Tsfayo? If the music had stopped with Tsfayo, we submit that the answer is clearly that the present appeals of Tsfayo cases not Runa Begum cases. And if there were any doubt about that, it's entirely dispelled by the way in which Tsfayo has now been dealt with in Crompton. Lord Kingsley in the United Kingdom, the Gaming Board case, is a clear instance of the case on the other side of the line from Tsfayo and these appeals, that is, it is a case on the Runa Begum side of the line. Kingsley, of course, having been concerned with who is a fit and proper person and that, of course, being akin to what is or is not suitable accommodation. These, on the other hand, the present appeals are cases where, unlike in Runa Begum and Kingsley in cases of that sort, the factual issues are not incidental but are discrete. In Runa Begum, Lord Hoffmann at paragraph 51 52 and 56 described the decision as to suitability as the subject matter of the decision and as a classic exercise of administrative discretion. Here, the subject matter is entirely different. It is not suitability. And it is not something else, which is a classic exercise of administrative discretion.

5	p1,00:01:48.860,00:02:57.890,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lords and my Lady. The starting point in this appeal is 7 short uncontroversial propositions. First, the appellants had an entitlement to accommodation. Their circumstances were such that the Housing Act required the authority to secure accommodation for them. Uh, secondly, that entitlement under the Housing Act existed until either accommodation was secured or an event occurred upon which the duty would cease. Thirdly, an officer of the councillors ruled that the duty and the entitlement have come to an end. Fourthly, that withdrawal of entitlement was upheld, a fraction slower. I'm sorry. The officers ruled the entitlement-- the duty and the entitlement had come to an end. Fourthly, that withdrawal of entitlement was upheld on review by another officer of the same authority.
5	p1,01:10:09.430,01:13:18.070,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And my Lord, It is, of course, an important feature of the statutory scheme. Yeah, that someone who is in priority need and not homeless intentionally and who is entitled to accommodation doesn't lose that accommodation because they decline a particular offer of accommodation which they don't regard as being suitable unless it has, in terms been drawn to their attention that they will lose the right. So it is important whether or not a letter of this kind is received. And more generally, part seven of the act relating to duties the homeless and their entitlements is very different from part six relating to the regulation of schemes for the allocation of housing and not giving anyone a right to accommodation. My Lord is it, um, said in this respect, part 7 of the Housing Act is similar to section 20 subsection 1 of the 1989 Children Act. Then I respond. Yes, in many ways it is. And that that assists me in that if who is a child is a question of precedent or jurisdictional fact on the construction of the Children's Act. That one has, of course, to look at the construction in our case of the Housing Act.

If they're relying on Section 193, subsection seven, then that is exclusively a question of fact. And my Lord, What we say is that these gateway questions of fact or exclusive questions of fact are eminently questions for a court, either as precedent questions or subsequent questions upon review for appeal.
5	p1,00:29:00.740,00:30:04.660,spk_1,	True	Counsel: I think the practise of the authority and no doubt of housing authorities generally is to make a composite decision rather than to have give her a ruling on the question of whether or not the letter has been received, and then to deal separately with any further questions that may arise.  Court: But is it only on review that the whole question is whether this letter has been received can arise? Counsel: Oh, no. The because the initial decision is based on the premise that the letter was sent and received,  Court: Um, the letter simply says, surely the you know, we've we've often do suitable accommodation and our duties discharged. It doesn't actually-- Counsel: No, the crucial letter is the earlier letter that says, You're offered this accommodation and if you don't take it, that's it.
5	p2,01:13:41.110,01:14:36.960,spk_2,	True	as it were, if you have the critical issues, homelessness and so on, all determined by an officer subject to any judicial review. Yet to have the question of whether a letter had been received gave the course of judicial inquiry, seems to us, not merely impracticable but disproportionate. Nor, of course, is that the end of it, because then you get a new offer and so on. And the want of proportionality is exacerbated in the present cases on their own facts bearing in mind that we're dealing with discharge of a single application as homeless in each case assistant, several serial homelessness. So Ms Ali didn't know there was a one offer policy.
5	p2,01:25:02.960,01:25:27.420,spk_2,	True	Counsel:  It's a point of law if it was omitted but if it has not been omitted, it's in there. Yes. We ring up, we discussed with her her reasons for refusal. She's been through this process before, she's been told about the one offer only policy, and indeed, she even --we discussed the offer letter with her.
5	p1,00:26:01.500,00:27:03.020,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Then the authority may notify him that they regard themselves as having discharge their duty. Under this section, the local authority subsection 6 will cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant ceases to be eligible, comes homeless, intentionally accepts an offer of accommodation under part 6, or accepts an offer of an assured tenancy or otherwise voluntarily ceases to occupy as his only or principle home. The accommodation made available for his occupation. The authorities should also cease to be subject to the duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequences, refusal and it is right to request the review of the suitability of the accommodation refuses a final offer of accommodation under part 6. An offer of accommodation under part 6 is a final offer for the purposes of sub seven if it's made in writing and states that it is a final offer for the purposes of subsection at 7.

I'm looking at the letter she got -- sorry the letter that was suggested she got, which is in dispute. But let's assume that somebody reads this letter and it says we have to offer you accommodation only once. It's a quarter the way down, this is your one and final offer and yet in this conversation, the reviewing officer gets into a discussion of suitability?

5	p3,02:09:39.430,02:12:24.970,spk_2,	True	Counsel: No. The point is, all that has to be done is to secure accommodation. It doesn't say the form of the accommodation. It doesn't say the tenure of the accommodation. It doesn't say the location of the 10th of the accommodation. All those are matters of judgement for the local authority and in my submission that is in very stark contrast to housing benefit in Sofia or to the disability benefit in Veneto, which are simply arithmetical calculations on the financial benefit that accrues once you've got your entitlement, Then the decision makers simply talks up the elements. And that's in total contrast in my submission to the nature of the duty and how it's discharged in section 193(2) and then The third contrast, which again, in my submission, is very great to any social security scheme is the way the duty can be discharged in 193(5) and 75. The local housing authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequences of refusal and of his right to review to request a review, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged under that having discharged their duty under this section and then seven. The local housing authority should also cease to be subject to a duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses a final offer of accommodation under part six. So, my lords, under this scheme, the right is lost. Yeah, if the view is taken that there has been an offer of accommodation which was suitable for him, and that necessarily involves a huge element of judgement discretion. However, you want to put it as to whether a suitable offer was made. There is no equivalent to that in housing benefit. For example, you can only lose your housing benefit if you cease to be entitled because you no longer meet the hard edged criteria. Part seven is completely different.

I also meant to explain to the caller that what I had -- that when I had said I received the offer letter. I was referring to a letter I had receive in respect of Teviot Tower. So she did, in fact, have the opportunity, your Lordships interview, saying she never had the opportunity.  Court: Well-- Counsel: she had the opportunity. She was -- I've just said your Lordship, that under Mohamed v Hammersmith Lord Slynn's case which I think your Lordship was therefore familiar with, it is an inquiry that's made by the reviewing officer, if he doesn't make sufficient enquiries, he can be challenged on that basis as always.
5	p3,01:10:57.320,01:11:53.560,spk_2,	True	Counsel: With the council involved, one would assume that in the vast majority of housing cases it will be arguments about suitability which will come to the fall at this stage won't be an argument about Did I get the letter or not? It will be arguments about that. Black wasn't suitable for various reasons. And doubtless that's why the review officer focused on that issue. So, yeah, in my submission, Begum, although I freely except it was over to deal with the issue in a great deal of detail and point to a whole series of reasons why to extend civil right to apart seven claim would be to go beyond Strasbourg. I turned them to the post strapped to the post Begum cases. Um, and Reliance is placed by my learned friend Mr Gowdy as it was by Mr Howell in Croydon on that series of Russian and Ukrainian cases, all of which substantively concern state housing in various forms
5	p4,00:09:41.740,00:12:40.640,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The local authority Housing Authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him, and the authority notify him, that they regard themselves after having discharged their duty under this section. Now, the first point to make is an obvious one. Unlike Section 20 of the Children Act, the section, subsection 1935 doesn't distinguish between different limbs that might be said, we're not talking about domestic precedent fact here, but that might be said within Article 6 terms, somehow to be discreet questions of fact. You can see that even within section 1935, there are certain things that might be argued by lawyers to be discreet. Have you been informed? Did you get the letter? Have you been informed of the possible consequence of refusal? Now, is that a discreet fact? Or is that a judgement? In other words, that becomes: was the letter good enough? So you got the letter that's not in dispute. But you say that this letter didn't tell me about the possible consequence of refusal. This letter missed the point. So is that a discreet question of fact? And then, very similarly of his right to request a review of the suitability, was that sufficiently clear? And then the next bit is if the applicant refuses an offer of accommodation, well, you can see that that could be analysed as a question of fact. Did your letter back refuse the offer, or was it more equivocal? One can see, in particular cases that might arise, and then which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him. Well, I think everybody would agree that was a judgement call and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged their duty. Well again. That could be: Did you get the letter? But it could also be questions within the letter as to whether it was clear or not. So, my Lord, in my submission, attempts to try to divide off one particular factual, inverted commas, issue only is going to give rise to a domino effect of other potential factual issues that could be argued to be discreet or in a non domestic sense conditions precedent. So in my submission, the statutory scheme, statutory words do not at all support an analysis that there are discrete questions of fact which can be wholly divorced from the rest of the part seven decision.

So there's a certain amount of common sense and practical solutions brought to their initially, which may take various forms. But the critical point is when the the final letter set out, I think, on the 21st of March declaring that because the offer has been refused, the duty ceases to exist. And that takes us into the regulations, does it?

Our learned friend Natalie Lieven Queen's counsel appears for the Secretary of State as intervener. Lords and my Lady, I should inform the court at the outset by way of update that Mrs Ibrahim has left her temporary accommodation and has not recently been in touch with either my instructing solicitor or the Legal Services Commission. We therefore do not have instructions and we do not know her current whereabouts. She and her 6 children may very well still be homeless. The one can put it now higher than that.

Under this section, the local authority subsection 6 will cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant ceases to be eligible, comes homeless, intentionally accepts an offer of accommodation under part 6, or accepts an offer of an assured tenancy or otherwise voluntarily ceases to occupy as his only or principle home. The accommodation made available for his occupation. The authorities should also cease to be subject to the duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequences, refusal and it is right to request the review of the suitability of the accommodation refuses a final offer of accommodation under part 6. An offer of accommodation under part 6 is a final offer for the purposes of sub seven if it's made in writing and states that it is a final offer for the purposes of subsection at 7.

It will be arguments about that. Black wasn't suitable for various reasons. And doubtless that's why the review officer focused on that issue. So, yeah, in my submission, Begum, although I freely except it was over to deal with the issue in a great deal of detail and point to a whole series of reasons why to extend civil right to apart seven claim would be to go beyond Strasbourg. I turned them to the post strapped to the post Begum cases. Um, and Reliance is placed by my learned friend Mr Gowdy as it was by Mr Howell in Croydon on that series of Russian and Ukrainian cases, all of which substantively concerned state housing.

First, the appellants had an entitlement to accommodation. Their circumstances were such that the Housing Act required the authority to secure accommodation for them. Uh, secondly, that entitlement under the Housing Act existed until either accommodation was secured or an event occurred upon which the duty would cease. Thirdly, an officer of the councillors ruled that the duty and the entitlement have come to an end. Fourthly, that withdrawal of entitlement was upheld, a fraction slower. I'm sorry. The officers ruled the entitlement-- the duty and the entitlement had come to an end. Fourthly, that withdrawal of entitlement was upheld on review by another officer of the same authority.

Yet to have the question of whether a letter had been received gave the course of judicial inquiry, seems to us, not merely impracticable but disproportionate. Nor, of course, is that the end of it, because then you get a new offer and so on. And the want of proportionality is exacerbated in the present cases on their own facts bearing in mind that we're dealing with discharge of a single application as homeless in each case assistant, several serial homelessness. So Ms Ali didn't know there was a one offer policy.

6	p4,00:13:58.590,00:15:15.550,spk_1,	True	Precisely, my Lord. Precisely. [laughing] Mrs, This submission was completely contrary to what was being argued in Tomlinson and I went back and checked the skeleton arguments and the judgement from the Court of Appeal, and there was no suggestion that it was being said that there were quite different issues around Ali and Ibrahim from these around Tomlinson. It is also relevant in my submission, and goes to the statutory scheme that for Mr. Goudie to win on this point would be what I would describe as a very pyrrhic victory because it's a very narrow point where in most cases I would suggest that's not going to be the issue that is arising between the individual and the housing authority. It's not going to be, I did get the letter or I didn't get the letter. It's going to be about suitability and issues around that. And then, of course, even if in many cases that very narrow issue about whether you got the letter or not is found in the claimant's favour, it still often won't answer the dispute because then they may well go on to be arguments about suitability.
6	p1,00:00:37.340,00:01:43.400,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Ultimately, this is the appeal in the field for all of entitlements. Which I appear with my learned friend Mr Zia Nabi two unintentionally homeless families in priority need and are learning friends, Mr Andrew Arden, Queen's counsel, and Mr Christopher Baker now appear for the local housing authority the city of Birmingham. Our learned friend Natalie Lieven Queen's counsel appears for the Secretary of State as intervener. Lords and my Lady, I should inform the court at the outset by way of update that Mrs Ibrahim has left her temporary accommodation and has not recently been in touch with either my instructing solicitor or the Legal Services Commission. We therefore do not have instructions and we do not know her current whereabouts. She and her 6 children may very well still be homeless. The one can put it now higher than that.

6	p1,01:10:09.430,01:13:18.070,spk_1,	True	Yes. And okay. And my Lord, It is, of course, an important feature of the statutory scheme. Yeah, that someone who is in priority need and not homeless intentionally and who is entitled to accommodation doesn't lose that accommodation because they decline a particular offer of accommodation which they don't regard as being suitable unless it has, in terms been drawn to their attention that they will lose the right. So it is important whether or not a letter of this kind is received. And more generally, part seven of the act relating to duties the homeless and their entitlements is very different from part six relating to the regulation of schemes for the allocation of housing and not giving anyone a right to accommodation. My Lord is it, um, said in this respect, part 7 of the Housing Act is similar to section 20 subsection 1 of the 1989 Children Act. Then I respond. Yes, in many ways it is. And that that assists me in that if who is a child is a question of precedent or jurisdictional fact on the construction of the Children's Act. That one has, of course, to look at the construction in our case of the Housing Act. And what as this court has seen, is in terms of Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. The first gateway question of fact is what the applicant informed of the possible consequences of refusal and the right to review. If so, the second gateway question of fact is, Did the applicant refused the accommodation? And then it's both those facts are established so that one is through the two gateways. Then one has the further question, not a question of fact arising. The Runa Begum question whether the authority are satisfied that the accommodation was suitable. So if and insofar as the authority is relying on Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. And then the suitability issue. If they're relying on Section 193, subsection seven, then that is exclusively a question of fact. And my Lord, What we say is that these gateway questions of fact or exclusive questions of fact are eminently questions for a court, either as precedent questions or subsequent questions upon review for appeal.
6	p3,01:59:43.820,02:06:10.770,spk_2,	True	Counsel: My Lord, I'll come well, the boundary point in my submission all flows back to Brian and taking into account those different criteria on breach. And I'll come to that when I come to breach. But yes, in my submission, what Lord Bingham and Hoffman said in Begum about being on the edge and engagement reflecting on Bridge goes back to Brian. And that, in turn, goes back to Mr Bratt's opinion. Brian, uh, just staying on Croydon for a moment. Uh, paragraph 45 of Lady Hale's opinion. Uh, if this is a civil right at all, therefore I'd be inclined to hold that it rests at the periphery of such rights the same point again. And then, my Lord Lord, hold. Yeah. Who, if I may say so with respect was slightly more definite on the point paragraphs 61 62 mhm 61. I read this passage as an endorsement of the points that passage in Rutabagas We've looked at on a number of occasions that Lord Lord Bingham made in Rana Begum that if an elastic interpretation is given to the Article 61 concept of civil rights, flexibility must also be given to the procedural requirements of that article. If over judicial isation of the administrative welfare scheme is to be avoided. But it is important to to recognise that in Sofia is in room to begin the question. If so, at what point administrative welfare schemes fall outside. The scope of Article 61 was not tested. Sofia, as I've said, fell within the mainstream of cases about social security and welfare benefits in room to begin the House preferred not to take a decision on this issue. 62. There are, however, a number of straws in the wind that has been generated by the decisions from Strasbourg since Reena Begum. That suggests that a distinction can now be made between the class of Social Security and welfare benefits that is of a kind exemplified by so lazy and those benefits which are, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgement by the relevant authority. The phrase civil rights is, of course, an autonomous concepts, the wound room. But it does convey the idea of what in stack the Strasbourg court referred to as an assessor to bill right in that paragraph, having declared that the convention must be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its provisions and in Paragraph 49 that it's in the interest of the convention as a whole, that the autonomous concept of possession in a one P one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights, the court said. And I've already read your lordships. That passage then 63 reference to luas. Oh, to a private right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law and to an individual right of which the applicant may consider him the holder himself. The holder are consistent with this approach. So, too, are the references in Manito to a right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law. Where the court added, the dispute must be genuine and serious. It may relate not only to the actual existence of the right to also do its scope and manner of exercise. The outcome. The proceedings must be directly decisive with the writing question cases where the award of benefit is dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and, if so, how the need for it has assessed ought to be met. Do not answer that description. The exact limits of the autonomous concept remain elusive. One can be confident that cases where the relationship between the beneficiary, the public authority, is a public law character, as in one room where the role of the applicant associations in regard to the construction and maintenance of public housing was over. Typically, general interest character fall outside the scope Mr Howell submitted. There's no distinction to be drawn between the forms in which welfare benefits may be provided. But none of the Strasbourg authorities goes that far. And the carefully worded passages from Suazo and Stack, to which I have referred, seemed to me to contradict his proposition. The series of cases about the enforcement of judgments made by the courts about social housing in Russia, to which he referred of which the latest is Nogovitsyn, offer no assistance as the question whether a duty to provide social housing gives rise to a civil right was not argued for these reasons. I think it can now be asserted with reasonable confidence that the duty of the local authority under Section 21 of the 1989 to provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of the factors mentioned in that subsection does not give rise to a civil right within the meaning of Article 61 of the convention. So my lords, in my submission that comes as close as this house caught in its previous guys was has been prepared to come to what is a civil right? Can I then turn to pull those submissions together in respect of the scheme under Part seven, and just point to what, in my submission, are the three critical elements as to why this isn't a civil right? Firstly, the series of highly evaluative judgments along the way to getting the right and I'll go to those in a second. Secondly, the way the right is met or discharged itself involves discretionary judgments. And thirdly, the circumstances in which the right can be lost or the duty can be discharged involves again highly evaluative judgments. Yeah, so I'm going to take this speedily because your Lordships have already looked at the scheme twice. But in terms of that first heading the series of highly judgmental decisions along the way to getting the right section of the act, of course, is that Volume one tabloid?

7	p2,00:03:58.710,00:07:53.970,spk_0,	True	The case concerned the Army board, which was held not to constitute an independent, impartial tribunal for Article 6 (1) purposes when dealing with assessing compensation payable to a member of the territorial Army who brought a redundancy complaint. And this is a case in which the court concluded that an application for judicial review by the individual concerned did have sufficiency of review to remedy the lack of independence this is the reasoning by which the court came to that conclusion, in that particular case, that is instructive. And there's certainly that there are no suggestion in Crompton, that a key feature about Tsfayo is the council having been a judge in its own cause or the position of the decision having been made by members rather than officers. What one sees is that Tsfayo is again and again treated as being of wider importance in its particular factual context. Paragraph 50 on page seven of the decision, under the heading D towards the bottom of the page, the scope of judicial review of administrative decision making. The court observes that the scope of judicial review in administrative decision making in the United Kingdom is set out in the court judgement in Tsfayo. Then, turning to the law and halfway down page 8, the applicability of Article six of the proceedings, the government accepted that the African civil rights were determined in the domestic proceedings and Article six was applicable. So this is an authority on the sufficiency of review element, and the court's assessment is from towards the bottom of page 11, that will be the court's assessment and then roman one general principles. Beginning with paragraph 40 The court recalls that even where an adjudicatory body, determining disputes over civil rights and obligations does not comply with Article 6(1) in some respect, no violation of the convention can be found if the proceedings before that body are subject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and does provide the guarantees of Article 6(1). So the question is always whether there is or is not full jurisdiction. Paragraph 71, the court has previously held that in order to determine whether the Article six compliant second tier tribunal had full jurisdiction or provided sufficiency of review to remedy a lack of independence, of first instance, it was necessary to have regard to such factors as the subject matter of the decision appealed against, the manner in which that decision was arrived at and the contents of the dispute, including the desired and actual ground of appeal. See Bryan and Tsfayo. In Bryan, the court found it reasonable that the jurisdiction of the High Court to review findings of fact made at first instance, be limited to considering whether the findings of facts or the inferences based on them were perverse or unreasonable. It reached that conclusion in light of the specialised area of law, an issue in the dispute and the expertise of the inspector in establishing the facts and exercising discretion on a wide range of policy matters accordingly, judicial review in that case offered sufficiency of review and the proceedings, complied with Article 6(1). The convention organs followed the approach set out in Bryan to find sufficiency of review in a number of cases against the United Kingdom.

7	p1,00:03:14.240,00:04:03.760,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And, fifthly, that second officer was not an independent and impartial tribunal not being independent at all. Sixthly, And in our submission of particular importance on these appeals, the decisions that both council officers made was one exclusively of primary fact whether a particular letter had or had not been received. So a decision not involving either specialist expertise or policy considerations and in those respects, wholly unlike a question that also arises under the same part of the same Housing Act, such as whether particular accommodation is suitable.
7	p4,00:09:41.740,00:12:40.640,spk_1,	True	Counsel: the local authority Housing Authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him, and the authority notify him, that they regard themselves after having discharged their duty under this section. Now, the first point to make is an obvious one. Unlike Section 20 of the Children Act, the section, subsection 1935 doesn't distinguish between different limbs that might be said, we're not talking about domestic precedent fact here, but that might be said within Article 6 terms, somehow to be discreet questions of fact. You can see that even within section 1935, there are certain things that might be argued by lawyers to be discreet. Have you been informed? Did you get the letter? Have you been informed of the possible consequence of refusal? Now, is that a discreet fact? Or is that a judgement? In other words, that becomes: was the letter good enough? So you got the letter that's not in dispute. But you say that this letter didn't tell me about the possible consequence of refusal. This letter missed the point. So is that a discreet question of fact? And then, very similarly of his right to request a review of the suitability, was that sufficiently clear? And then the next bit is if the applicant refuses an offer of accommodation, well, you can see that that could be analysed as a question of fact. Did your letter back refuse the offer, or was it more equivocal? One can see, in particular cases that might arise, and then which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him. Well, I think everybody would agree that was a judgement call and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged their duty. Well again. That could be: Did you get the letter? But it could also be questions within the letter as to whether it was clear or not. So, my Lord, in my submission, attempts to try to divide off one particular factual, inverted commas, issue only is going to give rise to a domino effect of other potential factual issues that could be argued to be discreet or in a non domestic sense conditions precedent. So in my submission, the statutory scheme, statutory words do not at all support an analysis that there are discrete questions of fact which can be wholly divorced from the rest of the part seven decision.
7	p1,00:08:40.680,00:12:09.660,spk_1,	True	Counsel: y Lord. Certainly, I'm going to come to the question of a practical considerations, which weighed heavily with the Court of Appeal and indeed with the judges in the county court and my Lord the, but in our submission put shortly there is. It is a perfectly workable arrangement, if that is what is needed, that one has certain aspects decided in one way and others in another. My Lord, my sixth. That preliminary point was the well, it's the point that I've made that the about yes, the seventh is that although, and this indeed is the point. Lady Hale has already raised that, although both the Ali and Ibrahim cases involved the issue of whether a particular letter has been received. Of course, cases that turn only on the resolution of fact can arise in other ways. In the homelessness context of which Tomlinson is an example, and my Lords and my Lady, this leaves 2 areas of major controversy. There is a third area of controversy in relation to remedy, whether it must be a declaration of incompatibility or not. But on the substance of the matter. Two major issues first were the council's adverse credibility findings against both appellants and consequent abandonment of the councils housing duties towards the appellant determinations of civil rights of the appellant's for Article six purposes. That is therefore, the determination not only at rights which plainly they are but of civil rights. We submit that they were civil rights that matters, what the Housing Act conferred, and secondly, if so, does Article six require a full merits review. In our submission, It does, in a case which turns on a simple question of primary fact with no specialist expertise required to determine it and no element of policy or discretion involved in the determination. Well, this latter submission well, the former submission involves the determination of a case that was not determined as such in Runa Begum, but was the assumption upon which the house proceeded. The latter submission involves either distinguishing or overruling the decision of the House of Lords in the Runa Begum case on suitability of accommodation. My Lord, another way of putting that submission is that it gives effect to the decision of the Strasbourg court in Tsfayo, in the UK and now also, we would say to the very recent and important decision of the Strasbourg court in Crompton and the UK a decision more recent even than our printed case, my Lord before coming in a moment to the first issue that is determination of civil rights. I should perhaps say a word about the composite expression in Article 6, an independent and impartial tribunal. Yes,
7	p3,02:09:39.430,02:12:24.970,spk_2,	True	Counsel: No. The point is, all that has to be done is to secure accommodation. It doesn't say the form of the accommodation. It doesn't say the tenure of the accommodation. It doesn't say the location of the 10th of the accommodation. All those are matters of judgement for the local authority and in my submission that is in very stark contrast to housing benefit in Sofia or to the disability benefit in Veneto, which are simply arithmetical calculations on the financial benefit that accrues once you've got your entitlement, Then the decision makers simply talks up the elements. And that's in total contrast in my submission to the nature of the duty and how it's discharged in section 1932 and then The third contrast, which again, in my submission, is very great to any social security scheme is the way the duty can be discharged in 1935 and 75. The local housing authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequences of refusal and of his right to review to request a review, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged under that having discharged their duty under this section and then seven. The local housing authority should also cease to be subject to a duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses a final offer of accommodation under part six. So, my lords, under this scheme, the right is lost. Yeah, if the view is taken that there has been an offer of accommodation which was suitable for him, and that necessarily involves a huge element of judgement discretion. However, you want to put it as to whether a suitable offer was made. There is no equivalent to that in housing benefit. For example, you can only lose your housing benefit if you cease to be entitled because you no longer meet the hard edged criteria. Part seven is completely different.
7	p3,01:10:11.540,01:10:48.530,spk_3,	True	Court: You can see this in the letters that were written. Actually, it's quite interesting that, of course, certainly in this case, the issue of whether or not she actually received the letter is there. Although she infected, it doesn't press the point as we know. But then a great deal of effort has gone into assessing suitability, and we see the same in Ibrahim that the concentration, perhaps naturally, the office is interested to see whether actually this was suitable accommodation in the first place, where it was a proper offer to make it all. I can see these issues or merging rather as the subsection suggests they do.
7	p4,00:47:24.380,00:48:23.080,spk_1,	False	
7	p1,01:10:09.430,01:13:18.070,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And my Lord, It is, of course, an important feature of the statutory scheme. Yeah, that someone who is in priority need and not homeless intentionally and who is entitled to accommodation doesn't lose that accommodation because they decline a particular offer of accommodation which they don't regard as being suitable unless it has, in terms been drawn to their attention that they will lose the right. So it is important whether or not a letter of this kind is received. And more generally, part seven of the act relating to duties the homeless and their entitlements is very different from part six relating to the regulation of schemes for the allocation of housing and not giving anyone a right to accommodation. My Lord is it, um, said in this respect, part 7 of the Housing Act is similar to section 20 subsection 1 of the 1989 Children Act. Then I respond. Yes, in many ways it is. And that that assists me in that if who is a child is a question of precedent or jurisdictional fact on the construction of the Children's Act. That one has, of course, to look at the construction in our case of the Housing Act. And what as this court has seen, is in terms of Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. The first gateway question of fact is what the applicant informed of the possible consequences of refusal and the right to review. If so, the second gateway question of fact is, Did the applicant refused the accommodation? And then it's both those facts are established so that one is through the two gateways. Then one has the further question, not a question of fact arising. The Runa Begum question whether the authority are satisfied that the accommodation was suitable. So if and insofar as the authority is relying on Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. And then the suitability issue. If they're relying on Section 193, subsection seven, then that is exclusively a question of fact. And my Lord, What we say is that these gateway questions of fact or exclusive questions of fact are eminently questions for a court, either as precedent questions or subsequent questions upon review for appeal.

If you do get that letter of Mrs Ali, and Mrs Ibrahim got that letter then, of course, they know, then proceeded on the basis that they had received an earlier letter that they have not received, and there's no reason why they shouldn't put in their their application for review in the normal way within the 21 days.
7	p1,00:29:00.740,00:30:04.660,spk_1,	True	Court: I mean, is there an initial decision taken in regards to that? Or is that-- Counsel: I think the practise of the authority and no doubt of housing authorities generally is to make a composite decision rather than to have give her a ruling on the question of whether or not the letter has been received, and then to deal separately with any further questions that may arise. Court: But is it only on review that the whole question is whether this letter has been received can arise? Counsel: Oh, no. The because the initial decision is based on the premise that the letter was sent and received,  Court: Um, surely the letter simply says, surely the you know, we've we've often do suitable accommodation and our duties discharged. It doesn't actually.  Counsel: The crucial letter is the earlier letter that says, You're offered this accommodation and if you don't take it, that's it.

It will be arguments about that. Black wasn't suitable for various reasons. And doubtless that's why the review officer focused on that issue. So, yeah, in my submission, Begum, although I freely except it was over to deal with the issue in a great deal of detail and point to a whole series of reasons why to extend civil right to apart seven claim would be to go beyond Strasbourg. I turned them to the post strapped to the post Begum cases. Um, and Reliance is placed by my learned friend Mr Gowdy as it was by Mr Howell in Croydon on that series of Russian and Ukrainian cases, all of which substantively concern state housing.

7	p1,00:01:48.860,00:02:57.890,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Indeed. Thank you. Yes, My Lords and my Lady. The starting point in this appeal is 7 short uncontroversial propositions. First, the appellants had an entitlement to accommodation. Their circumstances were such that the Housing Act required the authority to secure accommodation for them. Uh, secondly, that entitlement under the Housing Act existed until either accommodation was secured or an event occurred upon which the duty would cease. Thirdly, an officer of the councillors ruled that the duty and the entitlement have come to an end. Fourthly, that withdrawal of entitlement was upheld, a fraction slower. I'm sorry. The officers ruled the entitlement-- the duty and the entitlement had come to an end. Fourthly, that withdrawal of entitlement was upheld on review by another officer of the same authority.

8	p1,01:17:52.940,01:20:01.620,spk_1,	True	Counsel: thus far, I support what the decision says, the reasons that are there given. But then, on the question of civil rights from paragraph five onwards where reference is made to Alconbury, Lord Bingham states at paragraph 6, the European courts approach to rights deriving from social welfare schemes has been complicated by differences of legal tradition in various Member States. As Lord Hoffman explained in Alconbury comparison Feldbrugge in the Netherlands and Deumeland in Germany in the 1986 with Salesi and Italy, and Mennitto and Italy shows movement from a narrower towards a broader interpretation of civil rights. Further cases made no doubt continue that trend to hold that the right enjoyed by Runa Begum, is a civil right for purposes of Article 6 would, however, to be go further than the Strasbourg court has yet gone. And I'm satisfied that in the light of a compelling argument on this point by Mr Salesi, the Secretary of State, that the decision of this court would not many means necessarily be favourable to Runa Begum so I prefer to assume without deciding that Runa Begum's domestic law right is also a civil right and to consider whether on that assumption. But having regard to the nature of the right. The statutory provisions of an appeal to the county court on a point of law satisfies the requirements. Article 6 although the county court jurisdictions appellate's substance the same as that of the high Court in judicial review. Thus the court may not only quashed the authority's decision under 243, it's held to be officiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith, but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable, or if the decision maker is shown to have misunderstood or been ignorant of an established, in relevant fact.
8	p3,01:56:15.510,01:59:23.660,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Specifically for housing costs. And in Sofia, the UK government didn't contest that Article 61 was engaged and in my submission, very strongly. Contrary to what my learning from Mr Gowdy has said, there is a complete dick contrast for these purposes between the Housing benefit Scheme and rights under Part seven of the Housing Act to housing housing benefit is a cash benefit. It is subject to a precise set of legally hard edged criteria, and once one is entitled, there is an arithmetical calculation as to what one is entitled to in terms of amount. It therefore stands on all falls with Benito, and in my submission, it is utterly different. For the purposes of Article 61 from mhm the part seven rights before I make submissions on part seven. Specifically, Can I just ask your Lordships briefly to look at em in Croydon? In respect of civil rights? Of course, the comments in the opinions are over to there because, uh, your Lordships, tomorrow day after tomorrow, we're going to find against the secretary of state on and against the respondents on domestic point. But both my Lady Hale and Lord Hope did deal with civil rights, albeit briefly. First of all, Lady Hale at paragraph 39 refers to Bagan refers to, uh, the Russian cases and refers to so lazy and then in paragraph 40 um, first to the Russian cases not being based on any argument and then at the bottom of page 24 any entitlement under Section 21 that's the Children Act, which was an issue in that case, does not depend upon discretion. But it does depend upon an evaluation of some very soft criteria rather than specific rules. And it is difficult to say at what point the applicant may consider himself to be the holder of such a right. Hence, as my Lord Walker observed in Rana Begum, if they write, such as this is a civil right at all. It must lie close to the boundary of the concept and not at the core of what it entails. If so, this may have consequences for the second question, which is what Article six requires. And in my submission, the same points would be made here. If you get a right under Part seven, it is subject to some very soft criteria, and I'll come back to that in a moment.

8	p4,00:04:46.440,00:07:49.790,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And then my Lord dealing, going on to deal with breach. What I'm going to do is make a few general points but trying not to cover ground covered by Mr Arden. Then I'm going to deal with the Tsfayo and Crompton, Crompton briefly but Tsfayo in a little more detail because Mr Arden didn't do so. And then I'm going to conclude by just making submissions about those Bryan factors and how they apply to this case. So in terms of the general points, as I said, I'll take it quickly. First of all, in my submission, the issues in the present case were decided in Begum. Although Begum concerned a challenge to a finding on suitability of the accommodation offered, the decision was at the House of Lords was quite explicitly not limited to where cases where the issue was one of judgement alone. And the argument being advanced today by my learned friend Mr Goudie was rejected in terms in my submission in Begum and the references are Lord Bingham at paragraph 10 and Lord Hoffman at paragraph 58. So, in my submission, where that leaves us is either can one draw a distinction on the facts of this case and or do Tsfayo and Crompton force this court to depart from the House of Lords decision in Begum. Dealing with the first of those can one somehow draw a distinction on the facts? In my submission, the answers that plainly has to be no. Part seven of the Housing Act decisions are based on a complicated nexus of facts and judgments, and some of what might be called simple facts then lead into difficult judgments. So there might be facts about whether the lifts work regularly in a block. And that's a classically simple question of fact. How often in the last six months of these lifts broken? It may be critical then to the question as to whether the accommodation is suitable for somebody with two small children who has to carry them up the stairs. Those are exactly the kind of issues that do arise in suitability cases, and in my submission, it is completely unrealistic to try to divide up these issues into fact issues and judgement issues. And to go that way in my submission is to invite absolute chaos and I say that with care in my submission that is not too high absolute chaos in the county court, where some poor judge has to try to make these distinctions.
8	p4,01:11:00.870,01:13:50.430,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The fact that the duty may be discharged in different ways, provided always that it is discharged, that does not detract from the right and you do not need a judgement in your favour in order to have achieved the right. A right pursuant to statute is as much a civil right as a right pursuant to a judgement. If statutory rights exist, they do so whether or not a court has declared that they exist or if they've been denied, a mandatory order has been made with respect to them. A court order is not necessary in order for civil rights to crystallise and, were the position otherwise, it would be somewhat fortuitous and arbitrary. And the identification of a particular property is not an ingredient of the existence of the right. The right to have accommodation provided or secure, for one is itself a discreet right. It's not emasculated as such on account of separate questions that may arise in relation either to the performance of the duty or to the cessation of the duty and the Part 7, Section 193, Subsection 2 right indeed contrasts in that respect with the non-rights under Part 6 of the same act and the Part 7 Housing Act scheme, homelessness scheme is, moreover, similar to, rather than different from, cash benefits in having evaluative elements. Of course, if contrary to our submissions, one is looking at the scheme as a whole, then one can indeed point to evaluative elements in the homelessness scheme. But so, too, the housing benefit and other cash benefit schemes contain evaluative elements. By way of example only, housing benefit evaluation includes, considering whether there is a sham arrangement, whether there has been a deliberate deprivation of capital, and evaluation which compares rather with intentionality in the homeless scheme. And I think the one bundle the court hasn't looked at so far is Volume 2, which is devoted entirely to the housing benefit regulations.

8	p3,02:27:44.550,02:28:33.930,spk_2,	True	Counsel: However, as the commission top of the page correctly notes, this is a matter of semis only. The reason for withdrawing the ground might equally have been a recognition on the part of the applicant that the primary facts found and the conclusions reached by the inspector on the basis of those facts were so clearly correct is to be unassailable, however wide the review powers of the high court. However, I also find that there has been no violation of Article six in the present case on the broader ground that the powers of review in the High Court, under Section 289 of the act, are sufficiently wide to satisfy the requirement held by the court to be inherent in Article six that the judicial body determining the applicant civil rights and obligations should have full jurisdiction and just to stop there. The Section 289 power is effectively the same as judicial review.
8	p3,00:39:15.630,00:40:59.390,spk_4,	True	Court: In a sense, what what everybody saw was that if Article six applied and if Article 6 required fact finding powers in the, uh in a an independent and impartial tribunal according to law, Uh, well, then the issue is can one apply section 204 In that way? That's what everybody foresaw. And that is, in a sense, the difference between this situation and the Croydon situation. In the Croydon situation, there was no statutory right of appeal, no process at all. So the only one would have to be by judicial review, which, if required, can be adapted to whatever procedure is appropriate for to determine what it has to determine. In this, we've got a statutory provision that says Question of law, which is why you're saying the only answer is to declare Section 24 incompatible, and then the government can go away and think out whether it wants to set up a specialist tribunal to deal with these things. Some sensible system, rather than clogging up the court or whatever. Um, whereas everybody else is saying, Oh, no, we can in somewhere rather read Section 24 to enable the county court to do what the county court has to do, just as, one did in certain other other contexts. We don't have to get into whether this is a president fact or not. We don't have to get into all of that. We can just look at Section four. That is the difference between Croydon and this situation. 
8	p1,01:10:09.430,01:13:18.070,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Yes. And okay. And my Lord, It is, of course, an important feature of the statutory scheme. Yeah, that someone who is in priority need and not homeless intentionally and who is entitled to accommodation doesn't lose that accommodation because they decline a particular offer of accommodation which they don't regard as being suitable unless it has, in terms been drawn to their attention that they will lose the right. So it is important whether or not a letter of this kind is received. And more generally, part seven of the act relating to duties the homeless and their entitlements is very different from part six relating to the regulation of schemes for the allocation of housing and not giving anyone a right to accommodation. My Lord is it, um, said in this respect, part 7 of the Housing Act is similar to section 20 subsection 1 of the 1989 Children Act. Then I respond. Yes, in many ways it is. And that that assists me in that if who is a child is a question of precedent or jurisdictional fact on the construction of the Children's Act. That one has, of course, to look at the construction in our case of the Housing Act. And what as this court has seen, is in terms of Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. The first gateway question of fact is what the applicant informed of the possible consequences of refusal and the right to review. If so, the second gateway question of fact is, Did the applicant refused the accommodation? And then it's both those facts are established so that one is through the two gateways. Then one has the further question, not a question of fact arising. The Runa Begum question whether the authority are satisfied that the accommodation was suitable. So if and insofar as the authority is relying on Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. And then the suitability issue. If they're relying on Section 193, subsection seven, then that is exclusively a question of fact. And my Lord, What we say is that these gateway questions of fact or exclusive questions of fact are eminently questions for a court, either as precedent questions or subsequent questions upon review for appeal.
8	p1,01:14:17.210,01:17:46.550,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The manner in which the decision was arrived at and the content of the dispute, as the Strasbourg court has made clear. In Bryan and other cases, my Lord fundamental for present purposes is the materiality of the distinction between on the one hand an administrative decision, which require the exercise by experts as a policy, banks discretion, not the present cases and on the other hand, decisions which as here turn on issues of simple primary fact and no more in the former category. Of course, judicial review or appeal on law only as that concept is conventionally understood will suffice. But not in the latter category. And my Lord we submit that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum comes within the former category, concerned as it was with suitability of accommodation. My Lord, Runa Begum is in volume 4 of the authorities a tab 20. The decision and early 2003. Okay. Yes, my Lord's first at page 438 of the appeal cases report for Runa Begum, paragraph to the parties were agreed that the appeal raised 3 questions which they express in this way was the review officer's decision on protection to to a determination of civil rights within the meaning of Article 61. If so, did she constitute an independent, impartial tribunal for the purposes of that article? If not, the county court on appeal under section 204 possess full jurisdiction so as to guarantee compliance with Article 6(1). And the second of these questions is answered in paragraph three, not independent. That's an integral feature of the scheme. Paragraph 4, one other question inherent in the first question also lends itself to a summary answer. Whether for the purposes of domestic law, Runa Begum enjoyed anything properly recognised as a right, the authorities suggested. No I cannot accept this. Section 1932 imposed a duty on the authority to secure that accommodation was available for her occupation. This was a duty owed to an enforceable by her, related to a matter of acute concern to her, although Section 26 permitted the authority to performance duty in one of several ways. And although performance calls for the exercise of judgement by the authorities, I think it plain that the authorities duty gave rise to a pluralative in Runa Begum , even though this was not a private law rights enforceable by injunction and damages. The first question differently expressed is whether Runa Begum's right recognised in domestic law, also a civil rights in the autonomous meaning given to that expression for purposes of one of the convention.

8	p1,01:01:45.110,01:06:50.990,spk_1,	True	And indeed, of course, commonly authorities will not actually be providing the accommodation themselves, but will be securing it through nominations to registered social landlords or in a variety of means. There are therefore various forms of tenure, which will which will suffice. Um, but it is a tenancy that will be forthcoming. We respectfully submit that the position is as stated by Baroness Hale, then Lady Justice Hale in the Adan v Newham case, not the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal. But in our submission the correct view. Um, well, that's in Volume 3 of the authorities at the first case in that volume at 10. And Lady Justice Hale. Judgement begins paragraph 52 that page 2136 of the law report. And at the bottom of that page, article 61 is set out and then over the top of the next page miss Booth has accepted for the purpose of this hearing that the determination of an application for accommodation for for assistance in obtaining accommodation under Part seven is the determination of his civil rights and obligations and then continuing. The European Court of Human Rights has held that the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance, including even welfare assistance see Schuler-Zgraggen, see also Feldbrugge and Deumeland . Those cases were concerned what we would call social security benefits. But the court pointed out that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, the applicant was not only affected in her relations with the administrative authorities as such, but also suffered an interference with her means of subsistence. She was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in case of Germany in a federal statute and then continuing with the judgement to claim for accommodation under part 7 is also it is accepted for present purposes, such a right once the locals and then this is the key passage. Once the local authority are satisfied that the statutory criteria for providing accommodation exists, they have no discretion. They have to provide its irrespective of local conditions of demand and supply, hence this is more akin to a claim for Social Security benefits than it is a claim for social or other services where the authorities have a greater degree of discretion and resource considerations may also be relevant. Nevertheless, as Miss Booth points out the nature of the decision making process required by Article 61 differs according to the nature of the right being claimed, referring to Albert v Belgium adopting the concept of full jurisdiction. As Lord Hoffmann explained in Alconbury, subsequent European authorities shows the full jurisdiction does not mean full decision making power. It means full jurisdiction to deal with the case, as the nature of the decision requires. In assessing the sufficiency of the decision making process, under part seven must be relevant that authorities, with all the internal external controls to which they are subject to involved. On the other hand, decisions to house the homeless are quite different. The Secretary of State's decisions and planning and compulsory purchase with which the House of Lords was concerned, and Alconbury in that case, Will Hoffman drew a distinction between policy decisions what interest requires, which one would expect. One would expect to be taken by democratically accountable bodies and the determination of rights and then a short quotation followed by this. Decisions are under part seven of the 1996 Act's and not in any sense policy decisions as to what the public interest requires. And the policy decisions were taken by Parliament when it enacted the 1996 Act. Individual eligibility decisions are taken in the first instance by local housing authorities. But policy questions to the availability of resources or equity between the homeless and those on the waiting list for social housing are irrelevant to individual eligibility. Or we respectfully adopt all of that. My Lord, while we have the case to hand later on in the judgement of Lady Justice Hale observations which in our submission are relevant on the question on whether the result which we contend can be contended by section 3 of the act rather than requiring a declaration of incompatibility.

8	p4,00:09:41.740,00:12:40.640,spk_1,	True	lCounsel: the local authority Housing Authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him, and the authority notify him, that they regard themselves after having discharged their duty under this section. Now, the first point to make is an obvious one. Unlike Section 20 of the Children Act, the section, subsection 1935 doesn't distinguish between different limbs that might be said, we're not talking about domestic precedent fact here, but that might be said within Article 6 terms, somehow to be discreet questions of fact. You can see that even within section 1935, there are certain things that might be argued by lawyers to be discreet. Have you been informed? Did you get the letter? Have you been informed of the possible consequence of refusal? Now, is that a discreet fact? Or is that a judgement? In other words, that becomes: was the letter good enough? So you got the letter that's not in dispute. But you say that this letter didn't tell me about the possible consequence of refusal. This letter missed the point. So is that a discreet question of fact? And then, very similarly of his right to request a review of the suitability, was that sufficiently clear? And then the next bit is if the applicant refuses an offer of accommodation, well, you can see that that could be analysed as a question of fact. Did your letter back refuse the offer, or was it more equivocal? One can see, in particular cases that might arise, and then which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him. Well, I think everybody would agree that was a judgement call and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged their duty. Well again. That could be: Did you get the letter? But it could also be questions within the letter as to whether it was clear or not. So, my Lord, in my submission, attempts to try to divide off one particular factual, inverted commas, issue only is going to give rise to a domino effect of other potential factual issues that could be argued to be discreet or in a non domestic sense conditions precedent. So in my submission, the statutory scheme, statutory words do not at all support an analysis that there are discrete questions of fact which can be wholly divorced from the rest of the part seven decision.

8	p3,02:19:51.610,02:20:46.720,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In my submission, if Article six is engaged here, in other words, if it is a civil right, then it is absolutely on the borderline or on the periphery of what is a civil right, and that gives clear indications of the approach that should be taken to whether or not there's a breach of Article six, in other words, to whether or not there is a requirement for a full fact finding appeal mechanism and your lordships have already seen the references in Begum. If I just refer to the paragraphs Lord Bingham made this point of paragraph five and Lord Hoffman at paragraph 34. And, um, as we've seen a moment ago, my Lord Hope Lady Hale made the same point in Croydon.
8	p1,00:08:40.680,00:12:09.660,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord. Certainly, I'm going to come to the question of a practical considerations, which weighed heavily with the Court of Appeal and indeed with the judges in the county court and my Lord the, but in our submission put shortly there is. It is a perfectly workable arrangement, if that is what is needed, that one has certain aspects decided in one way and others in another. My Lord, my sixth. That preliminary point was the well, it's the point that I've made that the about yes, the seventh is that although, and this indeed is the point. Lady Hale has already raised that, although both the Ali and Ibrahim cases involved the issue of whether a particular letter has been received. Of course, cases that turn only on the resolution of fact can arise in other ways. In the homelessness context of which Tomlinson is an example, and my Lords and my Lady, this leaves 2 areas of major controversy. There is a third area of controversy in relation to remedy, whether it must be a declaration of incompatibility or not. But on the substance of the matter. Two major issues first were the council's adverse credibility findings against both appellants and consequent abandonment of the councils housing duties towards the appellant determinations of civil rights of the appellant's for Article six purposes. That is therefore, the determination not only at rights which plainly they are but of civil rights. We submit that they were civil rights that matters, what the Housing Act conferred, and secondly, if so, does Article six require a full merits review. In our submission, It does, in a case which turns on a simple question of primary fact with no specialist expertise required to determine it and no element of policy or discretion involved in the determination. Well, this latter submission well, the former submission involves the determination of a case that was not determined as such in Runa Begum, but was the assumption upon which the house proceeded. The latter submission involves either distinguishing or overruling the decision of the House of Lords in the Runa Begum case on suitability of accommodation. My Lord, another way of putting that submission is that it gives effect to the decision of the Strasbourg court in Tsfayo, in the UK and now also, we would say to the very recent and important decision of the Strasbourg court in Crompton and the UK a decision more recent even than our printed case, my Lord before coming in a moment to the first issue that is determination of civil rights. I should perhaps say a word about the composite expression in Article 6, an independent and impartial tribunal. Yes,
8	p3,00:08:52.240,00:10:10.350,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Uh, and it was the passage that I think I referred to already. While the Transport, just above b in 22 has the luxury of looking back at particular circumstances decided whether there's been a breach our national law has to devise the scheme, which we generally applicable for the impact of the decision is name. As Lord Justice Dyson puts it in the Court of Appeal. The question whether Article 8 is engaged should not be decided by a case by case basis, but the actual effect. And then it's 23. The difficult question is how the requirements of Article 6 applies it is a well named principal. Decisions which determine civil rights and obligations may be made by administrative authorities provided the Zen access to the independent, impartial tribunal full jurisdiction. What amounts to full jurisdiction there is, according to the nature of the decision, does not always require access to the court. Even for the determination of disputed issues of fact much depends on the subject matter of the decision. The quality of the initial decision making process, the classic exercise of administrative discussion, even though determinative of civil rights complication a number of safeguards to ensure the procedure is in fact a fair and impartial judicial review maybe adequate, even though there's no jurisdiction to examine the facts of merits.
9	p1,00:16:49.040,00:21:08.340,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The Housing Act is in Volume 1 of the authorities at tab 1. My Lord, what has been extracted into the extract is both part 6 allocation of housing, accommodation and part seven homelessness, my Lord so far as part 6 is concerned allocation. We're not on this appeal directly, if indeed at all. Concerned with part 6 but Your Lordship's and my Lady we have seen from the printed cases, the respondents do seek to derive something from part 6, so one should perhaps look briefly at its general structure. Um, the introductory section, Section 159 requires a local housing authority to comply with the provisions of part 6 in allocating housing accommodation and for the purposes of part 6. They allocate housing accommodation in any of the circumstances set out in subsection two and then one seized by subsection 7. That broadly, a local housing authority may allocate housing accommodation in such manner as they consider appropriate that subject to the provisions of the party, we need to look at Section 160 cases where provisions about allocations do not apply, then paid four of the extract the section 160A allocation only to eligible persons, and I can go on. I think the page 8 and 2 sections 166 relating to applications for housing accommodation. Subsection 1 requires a local housing authority to secure that advice and information is available and assistance in making such an application. Then, subsection 2, they shall secure the applicant is informed of their rights. Um, every application must be considered subsection 3 and then the scheme in the allocation scheme is Section 167. Allocation is to be in accordance with the allocation scheme. Every local authority should have an allocation scheme for determining priorities, and as for the procedure to be followed in allocating housing accommodation for this purpose, the procedure includes all aspects of the allocation process, and the scheme is to include a statement of the authorities policy on offering people who are to be allocated housing accommodations, choice of accommodation for the opportunity to express preferences, mhm and then subsection 2. As regards priorities, the scheme should be framed so as to secure that reasonable preference is given to 5 categories of people, the first of whom is persons who are homeless within the meaning of part seven and then one sees after little A, the scheme may also be framed so far give additional preference to particular descriptions of people within the subsections. People with urgent housing needs and to a the scheme mate may contain provisions for determining priorities and allocating accommodation people within subsection 2 and the factors which the scheme may allow to be taken into account and over the page one seasons halfway down, the page in subsection for the Secretary of State may make regulations subsection 5 procedure actually framed in accordance with principles prescribed by the Secretary of State. But subject to that, the authority may decide on the principles to be framed and then subsection aid that the authorities shall not allocate housing accommodation except in accordance with their allocation scheme.

The board was much nearer to being a court. If I may put it that way, um, than the review officer could be said to be, um, turn from paragraph 27. The Human Rights Court considers administrative decision making under our Human Rights Act, referring to Alconbury and then at paragraph 32 and 31 to Runa and onwards to Runa Begum. And then the refers at paragraph 34, uh, to the board being replaced by tribunals because of concerns about lack of independence with the potential for injustice. And then one comes to the body of the judgement, the alleged violation of Article 61 and 6 Section B of that, the court's assessment begins to paragraph 40.

Secondly, Section 193 subsection 2 of the Housing Act confers such a right again, not an issue. Yeah, thirdly, and again, not an issue that right continues until it ceases by virtue of any of the following provisions of Section 193. And fourthly, we submit this is where one does enter into controversy. We submit that the decision ultimately by the review officer, that the right has since with the determination of a civil right for article 6 purposes and that's the nub of the matter. For the purposes of the first issue my Lord's and my Lady, it is well established and not in dispute that is generally sufficient in order to constitute a civil right for article 6 purposes for there to be an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. So the 6 necessary and we say sufficient components of the civil right. First of all, that there is a right. Secondly, that the right is an economic right. Thirdly, that the economic right is an individual, right? Fourthly, that the right flows from rules. Fifthly, that those are specific rules, and sixthly that there are rules laid down in the statute in our case, shortly stated as we submit that each of those components is manifestly fully satisfied, that, looking at the question whether there is an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute was established as being the appropriate test by the Strasbourg court in cases such as Salesi and Italy and Mennitto and Italy. Cases involving non contributory social welfare benefits as do the present cases and that principle, we say, applies here that the right to accommodation is an individual right as much as any cash benefit. It's an economic right as much as any cash benefit. It flows from specific rules in part 7 of the Housing Act. And we submit the fact that part 7 of the Housing Act may be regarded as part of a scheme of social welfare provision does not affect the salacious classification. Again, it's clearly established by a series of Strasbourg decisions and is not in dispute that the right to a social Security or welfare benefit is not withstanding its public nature well capable of being a civil right.
9	p1,01:07:21.180,01:09:13.480,spk_1,	False	
9	p1,01:10:09.430,01:13:18.070,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Yes. And okay. And my Lord, It is, of course, an important feature of the statutory scheme. Yeah, that someone who is in priority need and not homeless intentionally and who is entitled to accommodation doesn't lose that accommodation because they decline a particular offer of accommodation which they don't regard as being suitable unless it has, in terms been drawn to their attention that they will lose the right. So it is important whether or not a letter of this kind is received. And more generally, part seven of the act relating to duties the homeless and their entitlements is very different from part six relating to the regulation of schemes for the allocation of housing and not giving anyone a right to accommodation. My Lord is it, um, said in this respect, part 7 of the Housing Act is similar to section 20 subsection 1 of the 1989 Children Act. Then I respond. Yes, in many ways it is. And that that assists me in that if who is a child is a question of precedent or jurisdictional fact on the construction of the Children's Act. That one has, of course, to look at the construction in our case of the Housing Act. And what as this court has seen, is in terms of Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. The first gateway question of fact is what the applicant informed of the possible consequences of refusal and the right to review. If so, the second gateway question of fact is, Did the applicant refused the accommodation? And then it's both those facts are established so that one is through the two gateways. Then one has the further question, not a question of fact arising. The Runa Begum question whether the authority are satisfied that the accommodation was suitable. So if and insofar as the authority is relying on Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. And then the suitability issue. If they're relying on Section 193, subsection seven, then that is exclusively a question of fact. And my Lord, What we say is that these gateway questions of fact or exclusive questions of fact are eminently questions for a court, either as precedent questions or subsequent questions upon review for appeal.
9	p2,01:29:38.890,01:30:43.070,spk_4,	True	Court: This was all done before the Human Rights Act? We had a situation, didn't we? In which we got a standard sort of administrative procedure, go along to your local authority, you say I'm homeless, please put me up, local authority makes various decisions by an officer. It's very common in that sort of agency situation to have a review procedure, benefits had that throughout for the purpose of correcting errors, basically. Nothing to do with independence, because, as you rightly pointed out, they were both equally lacking in independence, as such. That doesn't mean to say they lacked impartiality, but they might have lacked independence. Of course, like any other administrative decision, they're subject to judicial review. There was, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr Arden, but there was a stage at which it was argued that the right to be housed as a homeless person actually gave rise to a right in private law because it was susceptible to an action for breach of statutory duty, if you were not housed. 
9	p1,00:28:04.730,00:28:44.450,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Subsection 3, on appeal the court may make such order confirming, watching or varying the position as it thinks fit. My Lord, it may be and my Lady it may be convenient while we have this volume open to turn to the last tab, which is the review procedure regulations. And just to look at two provisions there.  Court: I'm terribly sorry [inaudible], just before we move on. Yeah. I mean, the review provisions under 193(5) in terms is a review of the suitability.
9	p1,01:20:07.110,01:23:43.830,spk_1,	True	Counsel: um, and therefore of its limitations can deal with all these issues, but no further. And no such question in paragraph 8 is this. Equality is this quality rather review sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 61 on the assumption that a civil right is an issue playing that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently credible conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authorities. The question is whether this limitation on the county court judges role deprives him of the jurisdiction necessary. Satisfy the requirements of Article 61 in the present context. In approaching this question, I regard three matters as particularly pertinent. First of all, part 7 is only part of a far reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing administration that scheme very largely entrusted to local housing authorities. While the homelessness provisions are intended to assist those individuals who are or may become homeless, there is a wider public dimension to the problem of homelessness. Secondly, although, as in the present case an authority may have to resolve disputes, factual issues, it's factual findings will only be staging posts on the way too much the much broader judgments which the authority has made in deciding whether it owes the full housing duty to an applicant under Section 1931, the authority has to be satisfied of 3 matters and not satisfied of another. Under 1937(b), the authority ceases to be subject full housing duty if it is satisfied that the accommodation offered to the applicant was suitable for the applicant and that it was reasonable for him to accept it. Thus, it is the authorities judgement which matters, and it is unlikely to be a simple factual decision. Yes, and then Thirdly, there's reference to the review regulations, and over the page of Paragraph 10 was referenced the question of contracting out, whether that be desirable or not, and in paragraph 11 in relation to the requirements of Article 6(1) are supplied to the review by a court that administrative decision made by a body not closed with the independence and impartiality required of Judicial Tribunal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence, as in relation to civil rights, has shown a degree of flexibility in its search for just and workman like submission solutions and then certain recent authorities of particular importance, including Byran and the UK and Kingsley in the UK amongst others. None of these cases is indistinguishable from the present, but taken together, they provide compelling support the conclusion that in a context such as this, the absence of a full fact finding jurisdiction in the tribunal, which appeal lies for an administrative decision making body does not disqualify that tribunal for the purpose of Article 6(1). This is a conclusion which I accept more readily because it gives effect to a procedure laid down by Parliament, which should properly operated, ensure fair treatment that such as Runa Begum Then there is the speech of Lord Hoffmann, and I can perhaps pick that up at paragraph 27 on page 445.
9	p1,00:27:05.770,00:28:03.850,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord. Before leaving these predictions, I should refer also further on to section 22 at page 44. That's the right to request a review. The applicant has a right to request a review in various circumstances and subsection three, the request for review must be made within 21 days or such longer period as may be allowed. And on a request being duly made, the authority shall review the decision and then on page 47 section 4. There's a right of appeal to the county court on a point of law. The, if an applicant who has requested a review is dissatisfied with the decision on the review, he may appeal to the county court on any point of law arising from the decision.

So the concept full jurisdiction accordingly requires the court take the decision of threshold remitted to some other body, fully independent, manifestly impartial. There is no such body at the moment. What Lord Justice Ward is recognising here in our submission is something that's implicit in the European and domestic discussion of the administrative rather than judicial model of decision making and his spelling that out that it is an administrator's job not to do people out of their rights but to administer their distribution, actually, and at risk of sounding simplistic, trained local authority. Housing officers are, by and large, there to house people. There's no conscious or unconscious intention to approach applicants. Unfavourably to house people is their job, and if anything, one would expect housing officers to lean in favour of applicants. The authorities wider interest is to prevent homelessness, not to generate it. Nor is the spectre of member pressure to be assumed. We're not saying it can never happen. But the reason, if I if I may say this, perhaps a mild tendency in some cases for courts. I dare say this to bring their own experience of local government, to bear, whether drive from practise or otherwise or general knowledge or what have you sometimes without appreciating some of the considerable. Some of us would say seismic changes that have taken place in local government over the last decade or two. In particular. Members are now statutorily required to commit to a code of conduct which has to, and they are disqualified as members if they don't sign up to it after a period of time. The code of conduct has to contain provisions, some of which are mandatory and set by government by statutory instrument, one of which I thought it's worth. And breach of these provisions leads to sanctions not just committee within the authority, but to something called the case tribunal of the Independent adjudication panel for England and can lead again to disqualification as a member. This is all under the Local Government Act 2000, and the reason I mentioned that, if I may is just to finish that point, I confess, I did wonder on the way here whether we should actually have produced this obviously we will produce copies if, well, if its helpful.

It can't be to a single member or to an officer, and it can equally be one or the other in constitutional terms and then the Lord in the procedure regulations in dealing with who is to make the decision on the review, that's regulation 2.

9	p1,00:35:40.950,00:38:10.150,spk_1,	True	Counsel: because the regulations provide a fairly limited form of review.  Court: Which tab? Counsel: Its part three of the regulations page three of the last had in the same bundle, Um, and on page 3 of the extra print out is part 3 of the regulations that relate to homelessness regulation 6. Request for a review and notification of review procedure, request for a review under Section 202 should be made to the authority. There's no complication here as to which authority and then sub 2 to accept where a case falls within regulation 7, which isn't relevant for our purposes. The authority for whom a request for a review has been made shall notify the applicant that he or someone acting on his behalf may make representations in writing to the authority in connection with the review. So that's the limit of it at the rate at that stage, namely to make representations and to do so in writing. But then Regulation 8 procedure on a review. The reviewer shall, um, uh, consider any representations made under Regulation 6 and any representations made under paragraph 2, paragraph 2 deals with the situation of the reviewer considers the deficiency or irregularity in the original decision or in the manner in which it was may, but is minded nonetheless to make a decision, which is against the interests of the applicant on one or more issues. If that is so, then the reviewers shall notify the applicant that the reviewer is so minded. And the reasons why and that the applicant or someone acting on his behalf may make representations to the reviewer orally or in writing or both orally and in writing. So it is still a matter of representations only, but in and only in the subsection two situation at least the representations maybe oral as well as or in stead of and in writing. That's the extent of the review.
9	p1,01:17:52.940,01:20:01.620,spk_1,	True	Counsel: thus far, I support what the decision says, the reasons that are there given. But then, on the question of civil rights from paragraph five onwards where reference is made to Alconbury, Lord Bingham states at paragraph 6, the European courts approach to rights deriving from social welfare schemes has been complicated by differences of legal tradition in various Member States. As Lord Hoffman explained in Alconbury comparison Feldbrugge in the Netherlands and Deumeland in Germany in the 1986 with Salesi and Italy, and Mennitto and Italy shows movement from a narrower towards a broader interpretation of civil rights. Further cases made no doubt continue that trend to hold that the right enjoyed by Runa Begum, is a civil right for purposes of Article 6 would, however, to be go further than the Strasbourg court has yet gone. And I'm satisfied that in the light of a compelling argument on this point by Mr Salesi, the Secretary of State, that the decision of this court would not many means necessarily be favourable to Runa Begum so I prefer to assume without deciding that Runa Begum's domestic law right is also a civil right and to consider whether on that assumption. But having regard to the nature of the right. The statutory provisions of an appeal to the county court on a point of law satisfies the requirements. Article 6 although the county court jurisdictions appellate's substance the same as that of the high Court in judicial review. Thus the court may not only quashed the authority's decision under 243, it's held to be officiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith, but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable, or if the decision maker is shown to have misunderstood or been ignorant of an established.
9	p4,00:09:41.740,00:12:40.640,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The local authority Housing Authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him, and the authority notify him, that they regard themselves after having discharged their duty under this section. Now, the first point to make is an obvious one. Unlike Section 20 of the Children Act, the section, subsection 1935 doesn't distinguish between different limbs that might be said, we're not talking about domestic precedent fact here, but that might be said within Article 6 terms, somehow to be discreet questions of fact. You can see that even within section 1935, there are certain things that might be argued by lawyers to be discreet. Have you been informed? Did you get the letter? Have you been informed of the possible consequence of refusal? Now, is that a discreet fact? Or is that a judgement? In other words, that becomes: was the letter good enough? So you got the letter that's not in dispute. But you say that this letter didn't tell me about the possible consequence of refusal. This letter missed the point. So is that a discreet question of fact? And then, very similarly of his right to request a review of the suitability, was that sufficiently clear? And then the next bit is if the applicant refuses an offer of accommodation, well, you can see that that could be analysed as a question of fact. Did your letter back refuse the offer, or was it more equivocal? One can see, in particular cases that might arise, and then which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him. Well, I think everybody would agree that was a judgement call and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged their duty. Well again. That could be: Did you get the letter? But it could also be questions within the letter as to whether it was clear or not. So, my Lord, in my submission, attempts to try to divide off one particular factual, inverted commas, issue only is going to give rise to a domino effect of other potential factual issues that could be argued to be discreet or in a non domestic sense conditions precedent. So in my submission, the statutory scheme, statutory words do not at all support an analysis that there are discrete questions of fact which can be wholly divorced from the rest of the part seven decision.
10	p3,02:09:39.430,02:12:24.970,spk_2,	True	Counsel: No. The point is, all that has to be done is to secure accommodation. It doesn't say the form of the accommodation. It doesn't say the tenure of the accommodation. It doesn't say the location of the 10th of the accommodation. All those are matters of judgement for the local authority and in my submission that is in very stark contrast to housing benefit in Sofia or to the disability benefit in Veneto, which are simply arithmetical calculations on the financial benefit that accrues once you've got your entitlement, Then the decision makers simply talks up the elements. And that's in total contrast in my submission to the nature of the duty and how it's discharged in section 1932 and then The third contrast, which again, in my submission, is very great to any social security scheme is the way the duty can be discharged in 1935 and 75. The local housing authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequences of refusal and of his right to review to request a review, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged under that having discharged their duty under this section and then seven. The local housing authority should also cease to be subject to a duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses a final offer of accommodation under part six. So, my lords, under this scheme, the right is lost. Yeah, if the view is taken that there has been an offer of accommodation which was suitable for him, and that necessarily involves a huge element of judgement discretion. However, you want to put it as to whether a suitable offer was made. There is no equivalent to that in housing benefit. For example, you can only lose your housing benefit if you cease to be entitled because you no longer meet the hard edged criteria. Part seven is completely different.

10	p3,01:52:43.610,01:54:01.230,spk_2,	True	Counsel: I think my lady, I could be wrong about this, but I think the answer lies in paragraph 84 may analytically relate back to what we were debating in teetering me, which was the in Voss. If one goes to paragraph 84 of the Italian case, the present case is therefore clearly distinguishable from the case of Voss in which the court held that a compensation scheme under the Polish German Reconciliation Foundation, former forced labourers which is distinct from the system as set out by the foundation law fell within the ambit of Article 60 convention. In that case, the court found that the applicant met the requirements and therefore enjoyed at least unarguable grounds. A right of compensation subsequently confirmed in the court's judgement as the applicants were clearly excluded from benefits under the foundation. Law and compensation for forced labour was only provided recently by the foundation law. The court considers that the applicants could not claim to have had a right of compensation, even unarguable grounds. It follows an article 61 of the convention does not apply to the facts of the present case. So as I understand it, the distinction was that involves they met the conditions of entitlement. They had a right. Therefore, I can't remember the facts of this sufficiently clearly as to whether it has crystallised into a particular amount. 
10	p4,01:16:07.320,01:18:00.380,spk_2,	True	Counsel: But my Lord therefore, one sees that housing benefit involves a mixture of evaluative questions and mere arithmetical mechanics and so forth. And the same is the same is true of homelessness scheme that one has elements of both, and one can take that with other financial benefits as well. For example, in the case of disability living allowance, there's a mobility component which may be at a higher or a lower rate and or there's a care component which may be at a higher or a middle or a lower rate, all depending on evaluative judgments as to the severity of needs and so forth. So that is a feature that is not peculiar to homelessness, as compared with cash benefits of one kind or another, including but not confined to, housing benefit. In our submission Wound, Braun and Gwaza were are entirely different cases, and the admissibility decision instead we submit supports our case in at least two respects. First, it's based on the Strasbourg decision in Schuler-Zgraggen against Switzerland in 1993 and the passage, which is quoted in the Stack Admissibility decision from Schuler-Zgraggen, that the court there held development in the law and the principle of equality

Wish they did help, didn't. But there are words later on about the absence of a legitimate expectation of property rights does not Presuppose the absence of a right recognised on arguable grounds and the meaning of Article 6. This is paragraph 81.

Counsel: Exactly we say it's exactly the same. If you were provided with money with a view to it, assisting you with your housing difficulties that would plainly be caught. And our submission, the fact that we're looking at a benefit in kind rather than a cash benefit doesn't make a difference. And indeed, what we say it comes to is that if the right conferred by Section 193 is a right to a welfare benefit, then the right plainly does fall within Article 6 unless there is sufficient reason to exclude it and that the issue therefore effectively resolves itself into the question. Does the fact that Section 193 provides for a benefit in kind a right to accommodation rather than a benefit in cash? Take it outside the general rule.
10	p1,00:39:22.620,00:43:18.130,spk_1,	True	Counsel: arising where particular qualifying conditions are met constitutes are right. My Lord, that's not an issue.

10	p3,01:36:47.860,01:38:57.850,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Article 6 purposes and at paragraphs 47 48. In the admissibility decision, the court dealt with this matter 47. The convention must also be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions. It is noteworthy in this respect that in its case law on the applicability of Article 61, the court originally held that claims only wealth claims regarding only welfare benefits which form part of a contributory schemes, were because of the similarity to private insurance schemes sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of disputes for the determination of civil rights. Seefeld Burger, However, in so lazy article 61 was held also to apply to a dispute over entitlement to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising that the applicant had an assessor to bill, right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison with private insurance schemes and the requirements for a form of contract between the individual and the state and then his reference to Shoeless Kragen and then 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the convention as a whole that the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one protocol one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of peculiar rights. Under Article 61. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation of Article one protocol, one which avoids inequalities of treatment based on distinctions which in the present day appear illogical or unsustainable. So that's where the courts saying the two articles should go hand in hand. And then my learned friend Mr Gowdy goes from there to suggest well, Article 1 Protocol 1 would support his analysis that benefits in kind, such as those under Part 7 fall within Article 1, Protocol 1, and for that purpose I want I've brought an additional authority, which should be on your Lordships desk called well, it starts associates.

10	p3,01:56:15.510,01:59:23.660,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In Sofia, the UK government didn't contest that Article 6(1) wasn't engaged and in my submission, very strongly. Contrary to what my learning from Mr Gowdy has said, there is a complete contrast for these purposes between the Housing benefit Scheme and rights under Part seven of the Housing Act to housing housing benefit is a cash benefit. It is subject to a precise set of legally hard edged criteria, and once one is entitled, there is an arithmetical calculation as to what one is entitled to in terms of amount. It therefore stands on all falls with Benito, and in my submission, it is utterly different. For the purposes of Article 61 from mhm the part seven rights before I make submissions on part seven. Specifically, Can I just ask your Lordships briefly to look at em in Croydon? In respect of civil rights? Of course, the comments in the opinions are over to there because, uh, your Lordships, tomorrow day after tomorrow, we're going to find against the secretary of state on and against the respondents on domestic point. But both my Lady Hale and Lord Hope did deal with civil rights, albeit briefly. First of all, Lady Hale at paragraph 39 refers to Bagan refers to, uh, the Russian cases and refers to so lazy and then in paragraph 40 um, first to the Russian cases not being based on any argument and then at the bottom of page 24 any entitlement under Section 21 that's the Children Act, which was an issue in that case, does not depend upon discretion. But it does depend upon an evaluation of some very soft criteria rather than specific rules. And it is difficult to say at what point the applicant may consider himself to be the holder of such a right. Hence, as my Lord Walker observed in Rana Begum, if they write, such as this is a civil right at all. It must lie close to the boundary of the concept and not at the core of what it entails. If so, this may have consequences for the second question, which is what Article six requires. And in my submission, the same points would be made here. If you get a right under Part seven, it is subject to some very soft criteria, and I'll come back to that in a moment.

10	p1,00:59:25.350,01:00:28.820,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord, certainly we submit that whether rights to benefits are or are not civil rights Article 6 purposes doesn't turn shouldn't turn on principle on whether the benefits are cash benefits or benefits in kind provided, of course, that the rights flow from not only that there is a right but the right flow from specific rules laid down in statute. And with all that in our submission is the present situation. Once the local authority are satisfied, the statutory criteria for providing accommodation exists, then the authority has no discretion. They have to provide the accommodation and they have to do so. I say they have to provide. They have to secure its provisions. It doesn't have direct. They have to secure its provisions and have to do so irrespective of resource considerations, irrespective of local conditions of demand and supply.
10	p3,00:44:52.090,00:51:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yeah, my lord. My lady. As your lordship’s know I am going to deal in its entirety with the first issue. Whether it's a civil right, I'm only going to deal with the second issue to the degree to make some supplementary comments, supplementary submissions to my friend Mr Arden's submissions. And then I will deal briefly with the matter of remedy. Where Mr Arden and I disagree, so far as the issue of Is this a civil right is concerned. Just so your lordships relationship know where I'm going. I'm going to deal first fairly quickly with the Strasbourg case law before Begum quickly because it's summarised in considerable depth in Begum. Then I will touch on Begum in relation to the civil rights issue. Then I will deal with the post Begum Strasbourg cases, then the Croydon case and lastly apply the tests to Part 7 of the Housing Act. Um, now in terms of the case law, up to Begum in respect of civil rights. First of all, it's important just to make clear there is no issue here that the claimants had some form of right, um, that's not disputed, and therefore the only question is whether it is a civil right within the meaning of Article 6. And it is, as your lordships will know very well clearly established that a civil right for the purposes of Article 6 is an autonomous concept. In other words, the way that it's described in domestic law is not determinative of whether it's a civil right or not, and again, to state what is certainly well known to my Lady Hale and my Lord I Hope from the Croydon case, Article 6 has extended into what English lawyers would consider two areas extended into what we would call public law in two ways. First of all, there are a series of cases about public law determinations which impact on private law rights, of which the classic examples are licencing. Decisions such as Kingsley planning decisions such as Brian and decisions relating to employment rights such as Albert and Lake Cont and into that category also now falls the case of Crompton, which relates to private law employment rights, albeit with a slight complication that it was a territorial army case. That line of cases in terms of is it a civil right is not what is an issue today. It's the second line of cases where there is a determination of a claim for a Social Security benefit, which is being suggested by my learned friends, has extended into Part 7 of the Housing Act and at that line of cases, really starts with the decision of the European court in a case called Felder Broker, which is in Volume 6 at tab 40. Uh huh and, yeah, Felda Brugger was a case concerning Dutch Social Security benefits, which were contributory benefits. In other words, the claimant had made payments under the equivalent of our national insurance scheme and whether her claim for the benefits fell within the term civil rights for Article 6 and I'll take your lordships in a moment to the key paragraphs. But the point of Felda Burger was that the European Court found that when it was a contributory benefits, it was directly analogous with a private insurance scheme benefit and therefore, in the same way that a private insurance scheme would give you the right to a would give a civil right and therefore Article 6 rights. If it was a contributory scheme, the same analysis must apply, and that's where one gets to Infeld a burger at paragraphs. Key part starts at page 8, paragraph 32. The European Court looks at the features of public law and says in 32 the first such factors as the character of the legislation. The legal rules governing Social Security benefits in the context of health insurance differ in many respects from the rules which apply to insurance in general, which are part of civil war civil law. The Netherlands state has assumed the responsibility of regulating the framework of the health health insurance scheme and overseeing the operation of that scheme. To this end, it specifies the categories of beneficiaries, defines the limits of the protection afforded, lays down the rates of the contributions and the allowances, et cetera, and that last sentence is important because it's picked up later in terms of the need for precise and clear rules. If one is to have an Article 6 civil right, then Paragraph 33 a second factor of relevance is the obligation to be insured against illness or, more precisely, the fact of being covered by insurance in the event of fulfilling the conditions laid down by the legislation. In other words, those concerned can either opt out of the benefits nor avoid having to pay the relevant contributions. And then, in 37 onwards, the court points to the private law features of the right and first of all, the personal and economic nature of the asserted right, a phrase which comes up again and again in the case law to begin with Paragraph 37. Mrs Feldberg was not affected in her relation with the public authorities as such acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, but in her personal capacity as a private individual, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming a right flowing from the specific rules laid down by the legislation in force. For the individual averting it such a right is often a crucial importance. This is especially so in the case of health insurance benefits, when the employee who is unable to work by reason of illness enjoys no other source of income. In short, the right in question was a personal, economic and individual right factor that brought it close to the civil sphere. And they go on in 38 to talk about the relationship with the employment contract, thus tying it in at that stage into private law rights. 
10	p3,01:14:02.030,01:15:48.460,spk_2,	True	Counsel: I think, to go off precisely relevant point to the case, my lady. My understanding is that under the old Soviet system that were very precise per metre allocations, depending on various criteria. Paragraph 40 alleged violation of Article 61 of the convention The court reiterates that Article 61 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to the civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way, it embodies the right to report of which the right of access that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters constitutes one aspect. However, that right would be illusory. If a contracting states domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party, it would be inconceivable that Article 61 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions to construe. Article 6 is being concerned exclusively. The access to a court and conduct of proceedings will be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law, which the contracting states undertook to respect when they ratified the convention. Execution of a judgement given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the trial for the purposes of Article 6 of Hornsby. So, my Lord, in my submission, that's the ratio of this case, and that is the pattern of all the subsequent cases. They focus on the non enforceability of the court orders in question. In each case, there is no reference to field of rigour line of cases.

10	p4,01:11:00.870,01:13:50.430,spk_2,	True	Counsel: fact that the duty may be discharged in different ways, provided always that it is discharged, that does not detract from the right and you do not need a judgement in your favour in order to have achieved the right. A right pursuant to statute is as much a civil right as a right pursuant to a judgement. If statutory rights exist, they do so whether or not a court has declared that they exist or if they've been denied, a mandatory order has been made with respect to them. A court order is not necessary in order for civil rights to crystallise and, were the position otherwise, it would be somewhat fortuitous and arbitrary. And the identification of a particular property is not an ingredient of the existence of the right. The right to have accommodation provided or secure, for one is itself a discreet right. It's not emasculated as such on account of separate questions that may arise in relation either to the performance of the duty or to the cessation of the duty and the Part 7, Section 193, Subsection 2 right indeed contrasts in that respect with the non-rights under Part 6 of the same act and the Part 7 Housing Act scheme, homelessness scheme is, moreover, similar to, rather than different from, cash benefits in having evaluative elements. Of course, if contrary to our submissions, one is looking at the scheme as a whole, then one can indeed point to evaluative elements in the homelessness scheme. But so, too, the housing benefit and other cash benefit schemes contain evaluative elements. By way of example only, housing benefit evaluation includes, considering whether there is a sham arrangement, whether there has been a deliberate deprivation of capital, and evaluation which compares rather with intentionality in the homeless scheme. And I think the one bundle the court hasn't looked at so far is Volume 2, which is devoted entirely to the housing benefit regulations.
11	p3,01:59:43.820,02:06:10.770,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes, my Lord, I'll come well, the boundary point in my submission all flows back to Brian and taking into account those different criteria on breach. And I'll come to that when I come to breach. But yes, in my submission, what Lord Bingham and Hoffman said in Begum about being on the edge and engagement reflecting on Bridge goes back to Brian. And that, in turn, goes back to Mr Bratt's opinion. Brian, uh, just staying on Croydon for a moment. Uh, paragraph 45 of Lady Hale's opinion. Uh, if this is a civil right at all, therefore I'd be inclined to hold that it rests at the periphery of such rights the same point again. And then, my Lord Lord, hold. Yeah. Who, if I may say so with respect was slightly more definite on the point paragraphs 61 62 mhm 61. I read this passage as an endorsement of the points that passage in Rutabagas We've looked at on a number of occasions that Lord Lord Bingham made in Rana Begum that if an elastic interpretation is given to the Article 61 concept of civil rights, flexibility must also be given to the procedural requirements of that article. If over judicial isation of the administrative welfare scheme is to be avoided. But it is important to to recognise that in Sofia is in room to begin the question. If so, at what point administrative welfare schemes fall outside. The scope of Article 61 was not tested. Sofia, as I've said, fell within the mainstream of cases about social security and welfare benefits in room to begin the House preferred not to take a decision on this issue. 62. There are, however, a number of straws in the wind that has been generated by the decisions from Strasbourg since Reena Begum. That suggests that a distinction can now be made between the class of Social Security and welfare benefits that is of a kind exemplified by so lazy and those benefits which are, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgement by the relevant authority. The phrase civil rights is, of course, an autonomous concepts, the wound room. But it does convey the idea of what in stack the Strasbourg court referred to as an assessor to bill right in that paragraph, having declared that the convention must be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its provisions and in Paragraph 49 that it's in the interest of the convention as a whole, that the autonomous concept of possession in a one P one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights, the court said. And I've already read your lordships. That passage then 63 reference to luas. Oh, to a private right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law and to an individual right of which the applicant may consider him the holder himself. The holder are consistent with this approach. So, too, are the references in Manito to a right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law. Where the court added, the dispute must be genuine and serious. It may relate not only to the actual existence of the right to also do its scope and manner of exercise. The outcome. The proceedings must be directly decisive with the writing question cases where the award of benefit is dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and, if so, how the need for it has assessed ought to be met. Do not answer that description. The exact limits of the autonomous concept remain elusive. One can be confident that cases where the relationship between the beneficiary, the public authority, is a public law character, as in one room where the role of the applicant associations in regard to the construction and maintenance of public housing was over. Typically, general interest character fall outside the scope Mr Howell submitted. There's no distinction to be drawn between the forms in which welfare benefits may be provided. But none of the Strasbourg authorities goes that far. And the carefully worded passages from Suazo and Stack, to which I have referred, seemed to me to contradict his proposition. The series of cases about the enforcement of judgments made by the courts about social housing in Russia, to which he referred of which the latest is Nogovitsyn, offer no assistance as the question whether a duty to provide social housing gives rise to a civil right was not argued for these reasons. I think it can now be asserted with reasonable confidence that the duty of the local authority under Section 21 of the 1989 to provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of the factors mentioned in that subsection does not give rise to a civil right within the meaning of Article 61 of the convention. So my lords, in my submission that comes as close as this house caught in its previous guys was has been prepared to come to what is a civil right? Can I then turn to pull those submissions together in respect of the scheme under Part seven, and just point to what, in my submission, are the three critical elements as to why this isn't a civil right? Firstly, the series of highly evaluative judgments along the way to getting the right and I'll go to those in a second. Secondly, the way the right is met or discharged itself involves discretionary judgments. And thirdly, the circumstances in which the right can be lost or the duty can be discharged involves again highly evaluative judgments. Yeah, so I'm going to take this speedily because your Lordships have already looked at the scheme twice. But in terms of that first heading the series of highly judgmental decisions along the way to getting the right section of the act, of course, is that Volume one tabloid?
11	p1,01:17:52.940,01:20:01.620,spk_1,	True	Counsel: thus far, I support what the decision says, the reasons that are there given. But then, on the question of civil rights from paragraph five onwards where reference is made to Alconbury, Lord Bingham states at paragraph 6, the European courts approach to rights deriving from social welfare schemes has been complicated by differences of legal tradition in various Member States. As Lord Hoffman explained in Alconbury comparison Feldbrugge in the Netherlands and Deumeland in Germany in the 1986 with Salesi and Italy, and Mennitto and Italy shows movement from a narrower towards a broader interpretation of civil rights. Further cases made no doubt continue that trend to hold that the right enjoyed by Runa Begum, is a civil right for purposes of Article 6 would, however, to be go further than the Strasbourg court has yet gone. And I'm satisfied that in the light of a compelling argument on this point by Mr Salesi, the Secretary of State, that the decision of this court would not many means necessarily be favourable to Runa Begum so I prefer to assume without deciding that Runa Begum's domestic law right is also a civil right and to consider whether on that assumption. But having regard to the nature of the right. The statutory provisions of an appeal to the county court on a point of law satisfies the requirements. Article 6 although the county court jurisdictions appellate's substance the same as that of the high Court in judicial review. Thus the court may not only quashed the authority's decision under 243, it's held to be officiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith, but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable, or if the decision maker is shown to have misunderstood or been ignorant of an established, in relevant fact.

11	p3,01:18:47.230,01:19:08.850,spk_4,	True	Court: That's the problem. That was what enabled Mr Howell to argue very strongly to us in the Croydon case. It's taken for rent because we're talking about the right to a trial. Um, and the right to a trial depends upon its being a civil right. So they've obviously taken it for granted that the trial that they got to get the order depended upon the existence of a civil right.
11	p1,01:01:45.110,01:06:50.990,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And indeed, of course, commonly authorities will not actually be providing the accommodation themselves, but will be securing it through nominations to registered social landlords or in a variety of means. There are therefore various forms of tenure, which will which will suffice. Um, but it is a tenancy that will be forthcoming. We respectfully submit that the position is as stated by Baroness Hale, then Lady Justice Hale in the Adan v Newham case, not the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal. But in our submission the correct view. Um, well, that's in Volume 3 of the authorities at the first case in that volume at 10. And Lady Justice Hale. Judgement begins paragraph 52 that page 2136 of the law report. And at the bottom of that page, article 61 is set out and then over the top of the next page miss Booth has accepted for the purpose of this hearing that the determination of an application for accommodation for for assistance in obtaining accommodation under Part seven is the determination of his civil rights and obligations and then continuing. The European Court of Human Rights has held that the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance, including even welfare assistance see Schuler-Zgraggen, see also Feldbrugge and Deumeland . Those cases were concerned what we would call social security benefits. But the court pointed out that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, the applicant was not only affected in her relations with the administrative authorities as such, but also suffered an interference with her means of subsistence. She was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in case of Germany in a federal statute and then continuing with the judgement to claim for accommodation under part 7 is also it is accepted for present purposes, such a right once the locals and then this is the key passage. Once the local authority are satisfied that the statutory criteria for providing accommodation exists, they have no discretion. They have to provide its irrespective of local conditions of demand and supply, hence this is more akin to a claim for Social Security benefits than it is a claim for social or other services where the authorities have a greater degree of discretion and resource considerations may also be relevant. Nevertheless, as Miss Booth points out the nature of the decision making process required by Article 61 differs according to the nature of the right being claimed, referring to Albert v Belgium adopting the concept of full jurisdiction. As Lord Hoffmann explained in Alconbury, subsequent European authorities shows the full jurisdiction does not mean full decision making power. It means full jurisdiction to deal with the case, as the nature of the decision requires. In assessing the sufficiency of the decision making process, under part seven must be relevant that authorities, with all the internal external controls to which they are subject to involved. On the other hand, decisions to house the homeless are quite different. The Secretary of State's decisions and planning and compulsory purchase with which the House of Lords was concerned, and Alconbury in that case, Will Hoffman drew a distinction between policy decisions what interest requires, which one would expect. One would expect to be taken by democratically accountable bodies and the determination of rights and then a short quotation followed by this. Decisions are under part seven of the 1996 Act's and not in any sense policy decisions as to what the public interest requires. And the policy decisions were taken by Parliament when it enacted the 1996 Act. Individual eligibility decisions are taken in the first instance by local housing authorities. But policy questions to the availability of resources or equity between the homeless and those on the waiting list for social housing are irrelevant to individual eligibility. Or we respectfully adopt all of that. My Lord, while we have the case to hand later on in the judgement of Lady Justice Hale.

11	p1,01:23:56.180,01:25:48.150,spk_1,	True	Court: Yeah, just refer briefly, if I may, to 27 but that's really on the point of Independent tribunal. So it is paragraph 28. I returned to the other two issue in dispute, and then refers to how they may relate to each other, referring to a dissenting opinion in Feldbrugge. Then in paragraph 29, the Strasbourg court has been left to develop the law. It's done so in two ways. First, it's been concerned to ensure that State parties do not exploit the gap left in Article 6 by changing their laws so as to convert a question which would ordinarily be regarded as appropriate. The civil adjudication into an administrative decision outside the reach of the article has done this by treating civil rights and obligations as an autonomous concept not dependent upon the domestic law, classification, right or obligation, which the citizens should have access to a court to determine, referring to Goudie in paragraph 30. The second development has been the doctrine, starting with Ringeisen in Austria in 1971 by which the Strasbourg court has extended Article 6 to cover a wide range of administrative decision making on the ground that the decision determines or decisively affects rights or obligations in private law. In a reference to Alconbury and then more recently, the scope of Article 6 has also been extended to public law rights, such as entitlement to Social Security or Welfare Benefit, and the publicly funded statutory schemes on the ground that they closely resemble writes in private law, referring to Salesi v Italy.
11	p1,00:01:48.860,00:02:57.890,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lords and my Lady. The starting point in this appeal is 7 short uncontroversial propositions. First, the appellants had an entitlement to accommodation. Their circumstances were such that the Housing Act required the authority to secure accommodation for them. Uh, secondly, that entitlement under the Housing Act existed until either accommodation was secured or an event occurred upon which the duty would cease. Thirdly, an officer of the councillors ruled that the duty and the entitlement have come to an end. Fourthly, that withdrawal of entitlement was upheld, a fraction slower. I'm sorry. The officers ruled the entitlement-- the duty and the entitlement had come to an end. Fourthly, that withdrawal of entitlement was upheld on review by another officer of the same authority.
11	p3,02:19:51.610,02:20:46.720,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In my submission, if Article six is engaged here, in other words, if it is a civil right, then it is absolutely on the borderline or on the periphery of what is a civil right, and that gives clear indications of the approach that should be taken to whether or not there's a breach of Article six, in other words, to whether or not there is a requirement for a full fact finding appeal mechanism and your lordships have already seen the references in Begum. If I just refer to the paragraphs Lord Bingham made this point of paragraph five and Lord Hoffman at paragraph 34. And, um, as we've seen a moment ago, my Lord Hope Lady Hale made the same point in Croydon.
11	p1,01:20:07.110,01:23:43.830,spk_1,	True	, and therefore of its limitations can deal with all these issues, but no further. And no such question in paragraph 8 is this. Equality is this quality rather review sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 61 on the assumption that a civil right is an issue playing that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently credible conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authorities. The question is whether this limitation on the county court judges role deprives him of the jurisdiction necessary. Satisfy the requirements of Article 61 in the present context. In approaching this question, I regard three matters as particularly pertinent. First of all, part 7 is only part of a far reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing administration that scheme very largely entrusted to local housing authorities. While the homelessness provisions are intended to assist those individuals who are or may become homeless, there is a wider public dimension to the problem of homelessness. Secondly, although, as in the present case an authority may have to resolve disputes, factual issues, it's factual findings will only be staging posts on the way too much the much broader judgments which the authority has made in deciding whether it owes the full housing duty to an applicant under Section 1931, the authority has to be satisfied of 3 matters and not satisfied of another. Under 1937(b), the authority ceases to be subject full housing duty if it is satisfied that the accommodation offered to the applicant was suitable for the applicant and that it was reasonable for him to accept it. Thus, it is the authorities judgement which matters, and it is unlikely to be a simple factual decision. Yes, and then Thirdly, there's reference to the review regulations, and over the page of Paragraph 10 was referenced the question of contracting out, whether that be desirable or not, and in paragraph 11 in relation to the requirements of Article 6(1) are supplied to the review by a court that administrative decision made by a body not closed with the independence and impartiality required of Judicial Tribunal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence, as in relation to civil rights, has shown a degree of flexibility in its search for just and workman like submission solutions and then certain recent authorities of particular importance, including Byran and the UK and Kingsley in the UK amongst others. None of these cases is indistinguishable from the present, but taken together, they provide compelling support the conclusion that in a context such as this, the absence of a full fact finding jurisdiction in the tribunal, which appeal lies for an administrative decision making body does not disqualify that tribunal for the purpose of Article 6(1). This is a conclusion which I accept more readily because it gives effect to a procedure laid down by Parliament, which should properly operated, ensure fair treatment that such as Runa Begum Then there is the speech of Lord Hoffmann, and I can perhaps pick that up at paragraph 27 on page 445.
11	p3,00:44:52.090,00:51:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yeah, my lord. My lady. As your lordship’s know I am going to deal in its entirety with the first issue.

Uh huh and, yeah, Felda Brugger was a case concerning Dutch Social Security benefits, which were contributory benefits. In other words, the claimant had made payments under the equivalent of our national insurance scheme and whether her claim for the benefits fell within the term civil rights for Article 6 and I'll take your lordships in a moment to the key paragraphs. But the point of Felda Burger was that the European Court found that when it was a contributory benefits, it was directly analogous with a private insurance scheme benefit and therefore, in the same way that a private insurance scheme would give you the right to a would give a civil right and therefore Article 6 rights. If it was a contributory scheme, the same analysis must apply, and that's where one gets to Infeld a burger at paragraphs. Key part starts at page 8, paragraph 32. The European Court looks at the features of public law and says in 32 the first such factors as the character of the legislation. The legal rules governing Social Security benefits in the context of health insurance differ in many respects from the rules which apply to insurance in general, which are part of civil war civil law. The Netherlands state has assumed the responsibility of regulating the framework of the health health insurance scheme and overseeing the operation of that scheme. To this end, it specifies the categories of beneficiaries, defines the limits of the protection afforded, lays down the rates of the contributions and the allowances, et cetera, and that last sentence is important because it's picked up later in terms of the need for precise and clear rules. If one is to have an Article 6 civil right, then Paragraph 33 a second factor of relevance is the obligation to be insured against illness or, more precisely, the fact of being covered by insurance in the event of fulfilling the conditions laid down by the legislation. In other words, those concerned can either opt out of the benefits nor avoid having to pay the relevant contributions. And then, in 37 onwards, the court points to the private law features of the right and first of all, the personal and economic nature of the asserted right, a phrase which comes up again and again in the case law to begin with Paragraph 37. Mrs Feldberg was not affected in her relation with the public authorities as such acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, but in her personal capacity as a private individual, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming a right flowing from the specific rules laid down by the legislation in force. For the individual averting it such a right is often a crucial importance. This is especially so in the case of health insurance benefits, when the employee who is unable to work by reason of illness enjoys no other source of income. In short, the right in question was a personal, economic and individual right factor that brought it close to the civil sphere. And they go on in 38 to talk about the relationship with the employment contract, thus tying it in at that stage into private law rights.
11	p4,01:11:00.870,01:13:50.430,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The fact that the duty may be discharged in different ways, provided always that it is discharged, that does not detract from the right and you do not need a judgement in your favour in order to have achieved the right. A right pursuant to statute is as much a civil right as a right pursuant to a judgement. If statutory rights exist, they do so whether or not a court has declared that they exist or if they've been denied, a mandatory order has been made with respect to them. A court order is not necessary in order for civil rights to crystallise and, were the position otherwise, it would be somewhat fortuitous and arbitrary. And the identification of a particular property is not an ingredient of the existence of the right. The right to have accommodation provided or secure, for one is itself a discreet right. It's not emasculated as such on account of separate questions that may arise in relation either to the performance of the duty or to the cessation of the duty and the Part 7, Section 193, Subsection 2 right indeed contrasts in that respect with the non-rights under Part 6 of the same act and the Part 7 Housing Act scheme, homelessness scheme is, moreover, similar to, rather than different from, cash benefits in having evaluative elements. Of course, if contrary to our submissions, one is looking at the scheme as a whole, then one can indeed point to evaluative elements in the homelessness scheme. But so, too, the housing benefit and other cash benefit schemes contain evaluative elements. By way of example only, housing benefit evaluation includes, considering whether there is a sham arrangement, whether there has been a deliberate deprivation of capital, and evaluation which compares rather with intentionality in the homeless scheme. And I think the one bundle the court hasn't looked at so far is Volume 2, which is devoted entirely to the housing benefit regulations.

If I can then turn to Bagan, which is in volume four, Tab 20. Now, it's right to say that the House of Lords in Begum were prepared to assume that civil rights Article 6 was engaged in order to go on to consider whether there was a bridge. But they did consider the matter of engagement in some detail, particularly Lord Hoffmann, and in my submission, it does give a very powerful steer to the approach to be taken now. I appreciate your Lordships have now looked at big twice at some length in this court, so I am going to really do no more than just 0.2 paragraphs. Lord Bingham, Paragraph 6 between letters E and F refers to fill the brother and so lazy and then says to hold that the right enjoyed by Rana Begum is a civil right, for the purposes of Article 6 would go further than Strasburg has yet gone satisfied. Bye, Mr Sales argument that the decision of the court by no means necessarily be favourable to him. And in my submission, nothing has changed from there.

11	p1,01:14:17.210,01:17:46.550,spk_1,	True	Counsel: manner in which the decision was arrived at and the content of the dispute, as the Strasbourg court has made clear. In Bryan and other cases, my Lord fundamental for present purposes is the materiality of the distinction between on the one hand an administrative decision, which require the exercise by experts as a policy, banks discretion, not the present cases and on the other hand, decisions which as here turn on issues of simple primary fact and no more in the former category. Of course, judicial review or appeal on law only as that concept is conventionally understood will suffice. But not in the latter category. And my Lord we submit that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum comes within the former category, concerned as it was with suitability of accommodation. My Lord, Runa Begum is in volume 4 of the authorities a tab 20. The decision and early 2003. Okay. Yes, my Lord's first at page 438 of the appeal cases report for Runa Begum, paragraph to the parties were agreed that the appeal raised 3 questions which they express in this way was the review officer's decision on protection to to a determination of civil rights within the meaning of Article 61. If so, did she constitute an independent, impartial tribunal for the purposes of that article? If not, the county court on appeal under section 204 possess full jurisdiction so as to guarantee compliance with Article 6(1). And the second of these questions is answered in paragraph three, not independent. That's an integral feature of the scheme. Paragraph 4, one other question inherent in the first question also lends itself to a summary answer. Whether for the purposes of domestic law, Runa Begum enjoyed anything properly recognised as a right, the authorities suggested. No I cannot accept this. Section 1932 imposed a duty on the authority to secure that accommodation was available for her occupation. This was a duty owed to an enforceable by her, related to a matter of acute concern to her, although Section 26 permitted the authority to performance duty in one of several ways. And although performance calls for the exercise of judgement by the authorities, I think it plain that the authorities duty gave rise to a pluralative in Runa Begum , even though this was not a private law rights enforceable by injunction and damages. The first question differently expressed is whether Runa Begum's right recognised in domestic law, also a civil rights in the autonomous meaning given to that expression for purposes of one of the convention.
11	p3,01:56:15.510,01:59:23.660,spk_2,	True	specifically for housing costs. And in Sofia, the UK government didn't contest that Article 61 was engaged and in my submission, very strongly. Contrary to what my learning from Mr Gowdy has said, there is a complete dick contrast for these purposes between the Housing benefit Scheme and rights under Part seven of the Housing Act to housing housing benefit is a cash benefit. It is subject to a precise set of legally hard edged criteria, and once one is entitled, there is an arithmetical calculation as to what one is entitled to in terms of amount. It therefore stands on all falls with Benito, and in my submission, it is utterly different. For the purposes of Article 61 from mhm the part seven rights before I make submissions on part seven. Specifically, Can I just ask your Lordships briefly to look at em in Croydon? In respect of civil rights? Of course, the comments in the opinions are over to there because, uh, your Lordships, tomorrow day after tomorrow, we're going to find against the secretary of state on and against the respondents on domestic point. But both my Lady Hale and Lord Hope did deal with civil rights, albeit briefly. First of all, Lady Hale at paragraph 39 refers to Bagan refers to, uh, the Russian cases and refers to so lazy and then in paragraph 40 um, first to the Russian cases not being based on any argument and then at the bottom of page 24 any entitlement under Section 21 that's the Children Act, which was an issue in that case, does not depend upon discretion. But it does depend upon an evaluation of some very soft criteria rather than specific rules. And it is difficult to say at what point the applicant may consider himself to be the holder of such a right. Hence, as my Lord Walker observed in Rana Begum, if they write, such as this is a civil right at all. It must lie close to the boundary of the concept and not at the core of what it entails. If so, this may have consequences for the second question, which is what Article six requires. And in my submission, the same points would be made here. If you get a right under Part seven, it is subject to some very soft criteria, and I'll come back to that in a moment.

11	p1,00:46:02.750,00:47:11.610,spk_1,	True	Court: I mean, is yours business go to the position here is really no different from what it would be instead of 193, saying they've got shall provide suitable accommodation, it said, On these preconditions, being satisfied, they shall produce £10,000 outright? Counsel: Exactly we say it's exactly the same. If you were provided with money with a view to it, assisting you with your housing difficulties that would plainly be caught. And our submission, the fact that we're looking at a benefit in kind rather than a cash benefit doesn't make a difference. And indeed, what we say it comes to is that if the right conferred by Section 193 is a right to a welfare benefit, then the right plainly does fall within Article 6 unless there is sufficient reason to exclude it and that the issue therefore effectively resolves itself into the question. Does the fact that Section 193 provides for a benefit in kind a right to accommodation rather than a benefit in cash? Take it outside the general rule.
11	p1,00:39:22.620,00:43:18.130,spk_1,	True	Counsel: arising where particular qualifying conditions are met constitutes a right. My Lord, that's not an issue. Secondly, Section 193 subsection 2 of the Housing Act confers such a right again, not an issue. Yeah, thirdly, and again, not an issue that right continues until it ceases by virtue of any of the following provisions of Section 193. And fourthly, we submit this is where one does enter into controversy. We submit that the decision ultimately by the review officer, that the right has since with the determination of a civil right for article 6 purposes and that's the nub of the matter. For the purposes of the first issue my Lord's and my Lady, it is well established and not in dispute that is generally sufficient in order to constitute a civil right for article 6 purposes for there to be an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. So the 6 necessary and we say sufficient components of the civil right. First of all, that there is a right. Secondly, that the right is an economic right. Thirdly, that the economic right is an individual, right? Fourthly, that the right flows from rules. Fifthly, that those are specific rules, and sixthly that there are rules laid down in the statute in our case, shortly stated as we submit that each of those components is manifestly fully satisfied, that, looking at the question whether there is an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute was established as being the appropriate test by the Strasbourg court in cases such as Salesi and Italy and Mennitto and Italy. Cases involving non contributory social welfare benefits as do the present cases and that principle, we say, applies here that the right to accommodation is an individual right as much as any cash benefit. It's an economic right as much as any cash benefit. It flows from specific rules in part 7 of the Housing Act. And we submit the fact that part 7 of the Housing Act may be regarded as part of a scheme of social welfare provision does not affect the salacious classification. Again, it's clearly established by a series of Strasbourg decisions and is not in dispute.

13	p1,01:17:52.940,01:20:01.620,spk_1,	True	Counsel: thus far, I support what the decision says, the reasons that are there given. But then, on the question of civil rights from paragraph five onwards where reference is made to Alconbury, Lord Bingham states at paragraph 6, the European courts approach to rights deriving from social welfare schemes has been complicated by differences of legal tradition in various Member States. As Lord Hoffman explained in Alconbury comparison Feldbrugge in the Netherlands and Deumeland in Germany in the 1986 with Salesi and Italy, and Mennitto and Italy shows movement from a narrower towards a broader interpretation of civil rights. Further cases made no doubt continue that trend to hold that the right enjoyed by Runa Begum, is a civil right for purposes of Article 6 would, however, to be go further than the Strasbourg court has yet gone. And I'm satisfied that in the light of a compelling argument on this point by Mr Salesi, the Secretary of State, that the decision of this court would not many means necessarily be favourable to Runa Begum so I prefer to assume without deciding that Runa Begum's domestic law right is also a civil right and to consider whether on that assumption. But having regard to the nature of the right. The statutory provisions of an appeal to the county court on a point of law satisfies the requirements. Article 6 although the county court jurisdictions appellate's substance the same as that of the high Court in judicial review. Thus the court may not only quashed the authority's decision under 243, it's held to be officiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith, but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable, or if the decision maker is shown to have misunderstood or been ignorant of an established in relevant fact.

13	p3,00:44:52.090,00:51:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yeah, my lord. My lady. As your lordship’s know I am going to deal in its entirety with the first issue. Whether it's a civil right, I'm only going to deal with the second issue to the degree to make some supplementary comments, supplementary submissions to my friend Mr Arden's submissions. And then I will deal briefly with the matter of remedy. Where Mr Arden and I disagree, so far as the issue of Is this a civil right is concerned. Just so your lordships relationship know where I'm going. I'm going to deal first fairly quickly with the Strasbourg case law before Begum quickly because it's summarised in considerable depth in Begum. Then I will touch on Begum in relation to the civil rights issue. Then I will deal with the post Begum Strasbourg cases, then the Croydon case and lastly apply the tests to Part 7 of the Housing Act. Um, now in terms of the case law, up to Begum in respect of civil rights. First of all, it's important just to make clear there is no issue here that the claimants had some form of right, um, that's not disputed, and therefore the only question is whether it is a civil right within the meaning of Article 6. And it is, as your lordships will know very well clearly established that a civil right for the purposes of Article 6 is an autonomous concept. In other words, the way that it's described in domestic law is not determinative of whether it's a civil right or not, and again, to state what is certainly well known to my Lady Hale and my Lord I Hope from the Croydon case, Article 6 has extended into what English lawyers would consider two areas extended into what we would call public law in two ways. First of all, there are a series of cases about public law determinations which impact on private law rights, of which the classic examples are licencing. Decisions such as Kingsley planning decisions such as Brian and decisions relating to employment rights such as Albert and Lake Cont and into that category also now falls the case of Crompton, which relates to private law employment rights, albeit with a slight complication that it was a territorial army case. That line of cases in terms of is it a civil right is not what is an issue today. It's the second line of cases where there is a determination of a claim for a Social Security benefit, which is being suggested by my learned friends, has extended into Part 7 of the Housing Act and at that line of cases, really starts with the decision of the European court in a case called Felder Broker, which is in Volume 6 at tab 40. Uh huh and, yeah, Felda Brugger was a case concerning Dutch Social Security benefits, which were contributory benefits. In other words, the claimant had made payments under the equivalent of our national insurance scheme and whether her claim for the benefits fell within the term civil rights for Article 6 and I'll take your lordships in a moment to the key paragraphs. But the point of Felda Burger was that the European Court found that when it was a contributory benefits, it was directly analogous with a private insurance scheme benefit and therefore, in the same way that a private insurance scheme would give you the right to a would give a civil right and therefore Article 6 rights. If it was a contributory scheme, the same analysis must apply, and that's where one gets to Infeld a burger at paragraphs. Key part starts at page 8, paragraph 32. The European Court looks at the features of public law and says in 32 the first such factors as the character of the legislation. The legal rules governing Social Security benefits in the context of health insurance differ in many respects from the rules which apply to insurance in general, which are part of civil war civil law. The Netherlands state has assumed the responsibility of regulating the framework of the health health insurance scheme and overseeing the operation of that scheme. To this end, it specifies the categories of beneficiaries, defines the limits of the protection afforded, lays down the rates of the contributions and the allowances, et cetera, and that last sentence is important because it's picked up later in terms of the need for precise and clear rules.

In other words, those concerned can either opt out of the benefits nor avoid having to pay the relevant contributions. And then, in 37 onwards, the court points to the private law features of the right and first of all, the personal and economic nature of the asserted right, a phrase which comes up again and again in the case law to begin with Paragraph 37. Mrs Feldberg was not affected in her relation with the public authorities as such acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, but in her personal capacity as a private individual, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming a right flowing from the specific rules laid down by the legislation in force. For the individual averting it such a right is often a crucial importance. This is especially so in the case of health insurance benefits, when the employee who is unable to work by reason of illness enjoys no other source of income. In short, the right in question was a personal, economic and individual right factor that brought it close to the civil sphere. And they go on in 38 to talk about the relationship with the employment contract, thus tying it in at that stage into private law rights.

13	p3,00:52:40.140,00:55:23.470,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Absolutely, My lord. And again similar in some European schemes to a private insurance scheme. One then goes from there to the extension of that principle for contributory benefits to non contributory benefits. And that is the case law, Salesi against Italy and minuto against Italy. And if I just ask your Lordships and Lady to look at volume 7 tab 52. Just to summarise where one gets to in Selelaze is a non contributory welfare benefit scheme for the disabled. And what comes out of so lazy is that the distinction between contributory and non contributory benefits by 1993 when this judgement is given, was no longer one that could be sustained. And just to put that into a British context, if one thinks of the distinction between contributory benefits that one pays for through national insurance and non contributory benefits, that distinction has effectively been eaten away since the Second World War and is now very difficult to find in the legislation any principal distinction. So in so lazy, if one goes understand, take the key passages. If one goes to paragraph 19, where the court is dealing with the applicability of Article 19, it starts by the court, referring back to Felder Bruggere and in the third line of 19. At that time, the court noted, there was great diversity in the legislation and practise of the member states of the Council of Europe, has regarded the nature of entitlement to insurance benefits under social security schemes. Nevertheless, the development in the law that was initiated by those judgments and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 61 does apply in the field of social insurance. In the present case, however, the question arises in connection with welfare assistance and not, as previously cited social insurance. Certainly there are differences between the two, but they cannot be regarded as fundamental in the present stage of development of social security law. This justifies following in relation to the entitlement to welfare allowances. The opinion, which emerges from the aforementioned judgments as regard the classifications of the right to social insurance benefits, namely that state intervention is not sufficient to establish the Article 61 as inapplicable.
13	p1,01:23:56.180,01:25:48.150,spk_1,	True	Court: Yeah, just refer briefly, if I may, to 27 but that's really on the point of Independent tribunal. So it is paragraph 28. I returned to the other two issue in dispute, and then refers to how they may relate to each other, referring to a dissenting opinion in Feldbrugge. Then in paragraph 29, the Strasbourg court has been left to develop the law. It's done so in two ways. First, it's been concerned to ensure that State parties do not exploit the gap left in Article 6 by changing their laws so as to convert a question which would ordinarily be regarded as appropriate. The civil adjudication into an administrative decision outside the reach of the article has done this by treating civil rights and obligations as an autonomous concept not dependent upon the domestic law, classification, right or obligation, which the citizens should have access to a court to determine, referring to Goudie in paragraph 30. The second development has been the doctrine, starting with Ringeisen in Austria in 1971 by which the Strasbourg court has extended Article 6 to cover a wide range of administrative decision making on the ground that the decision determines or decisively affects rights or obligations in private law. In a reference to Alconbury and then more recently, the scope of Article 6 has also been extended to public law rights, such as entitlement to Social Security or Welfare Benefit, and the publicly funded statutory schemes on the ground that they closely resemble writes in private law, referring to Salesi v Italy.
13	p1,01:20:07.110,01:23:43.830,spk_1,	True	Counsel: um, and therefore of its limitations can deal with all these issues, but no further. And no such question in paragraph 8 is this. Equality is this quality rather review sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 61 on the assumption that a civil right is an issue playing that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently credible conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authorities. The question is whether this limitation on the county court judges role deprives him of the jurisdiction necessary. Satisfy the requirements of Article 61 in the present context. In approaching this question, I regard three matters as particularly pertinent. First of all, part 7 is only part of a far reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing administration that scheme very largely entrusted to local housing authorities. While the homelessness provisions are intended to assist those individuals who are or may become homeless, there is a wider public dimension to the problem of homelessness. Secondly, although, as in the present case an authority may have to resolve disputes, factual issues, it's factual findings will only be staging posts on the way too much the much broader judgments which the authority has made in deciding whether it owes the full housing duty to an applicant under Section 1931, the authority has to be satisfied of 3 matters and not satisfied of another. Under 1937(b), the authority ceases to be subject full housing duty if it is satisfied that the accommodation offered to the applicant was suitable for the applicant and that it was reasonable for him to accept it. Thus, it is the authorities judgement which matters, and it is unlikely to be a simple factual decision. Yes, and then Thirdly, there's reference to the review regulations, and over the page of Paragraph 10 was referenced the question of contracting out, whether that be desirable or not, and in paragraph 11 in relation to the requirements of Article 6(1) are supplied to the review by a court that administrative decision made by a body not closed with the independence and impartiality required of Judicial Tribunal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence, as in relation to civil rights, has shown a degree of flexibility in its search for just and workman like submission solutions and then certain recent authorities of particular importance, including Byran and the UK and Kingsley in the UK amongst others. None of these cases is indistinguishable from the present, but taken together, they provide compelling support the conclusion that in a context such as this, the absence of a full fact finding jurisdiction in the tribunal, which appeal lies for an administrative decision making body does not disqualify that tribunal for the purpose of Article 6(1). This is a conclusion which I accept more readily because it gives effect to a procedure laid down by Parliament, which should properly operated, ensure fair treatment that such as Runa Begum Then there is the speech of Lord Hoffmann, and I can perhaps pick that up at paragraph 27 on page 445.

It's an economic right as much as any cash benefit. It flows from specific rules in part 7 of the Housing Act. And we submit the fact that part 7 of the Housing Act may be regarded as part of a scheme of social welfare provision does not affect the salacious classification. Again, it's clearly established by a series of Strasbourg decisions and is not in dispute that the right to a social Security or welfare benefit is not withstanding its public nature well capable of being a civil right,

Clearly, Part 7 raises different factual issues, but the European court has said yes, we did this in Stack, but we didn't mean it to go any further than that. And my learned friend Mr Gowdy yesterday suggested to you that the case law on Article 1 protocol 1 assisted him in saying that, Part 7 rights for civil rights for Article 6.

The convention must also be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions. It is noteworthy in this respect that in its case law on the applicability of Article 61, the court originally held that claims only wealth claims regarding only welfare benefits which form part of a contributory schemes, were because of the similarity to private insurance schemes sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of disputes for the determination of civil rights. Seefeld Burger, However, in so lazy article 61 was held also to apply to a dispute over entitlement to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising that the applicant had an assessor to bill, right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison with private insurance schemes and the requirements for a form of contract between the individual and the state and then his reference to Shoeless Kragen and then 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the convention as a whole that the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one protocol one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of peculiar rights. Under Article 61. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation of Article one protocol, one which avoids inequalities of treatment based on distinctions which in the present day appear illogical or unsustainable. So that's where the courts saying the two articles should go hand in hand. And then my learned friend Mr Gowdy goes from there to suggest well, Article 1 Protocol 1 would support his analysis that benefits in kind, such as those under Part 7 fall within Article 1, Protocol 1, and for that purpose I want I've brought an additional authority, which should be on your Lordships desk.
13	p1,01:14:17.210,01:17:46.550,spk_1,	True	Counsel: In Bryan and other cases, my Lord fundamental for present purposes is the materiality of the distinction between on the one hand an administrative decision, which require the exercise by experts as a policy, banks discretion, not the present cases and on the other hand, decisions which as here turn on issues of simple primary fact and no more in the former category. Of course, judicial review or appeal on law only as that concept is conventionally understood will suffice. But not in the latter category. And my Lord we submit that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum comes within the former category, concerned as it was with suitability of accommodation. My Lord, Runa Begum is in volume 4 of the authorities a tab 20. The decision and early 2003. Okay. Yes, my Lord's first at page 438 of the appeal cases report for Runa Begum, paragraph to the parties were agreed that the appeal raised 3 questions which they express in this way was the review officer's decision on protection to to a determination of civil rights within the meaning of Article 61. If so, did she constitute an independent, impartial tribunal for the purposes of that article? If not, the county court on appeal under section 204 possess full jurisdiction so as to guarantee compliance with Article 6(1). And the second of these questions is answered in paragraph three, not independent. That's an integral feature of the scheme. Paragraph 4, one other question inherent in the first question also lends itself to a summary answer. Whether for the purposes of domestic law, Runa Begum enjoyed anything properly recognised as a right, the authorities suggested. No I cannot accept this. Section 1932 imposed a duty on the authority to secure that accommodation was available for her occupation. This was a duty owed to an enforceable by her, related to a matter of acute concern to her, although Section 26 permitted the authority to performance duty in one of several ways. And although performance calls for the exercise of judgement by the authorities, I think it plain that the authorities duty gave rise to a pluralative in Runa Begum , even though this was not a private law rights enforceable by injunction and damages. The first question differently expressed is whether Runa Begum's right recognised in domestic law, also a civil rights in the autonomous meaning given to that expression for purposes of one of the convention.

However, in the Salesi v Italy judgement Article 61 was held by a dispute over entitled to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising the the applicant had an assertive all right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison private insurance schemes and the requirement reform of contract between the individual and the State. In Schuler-Zgraggen, the court held development in the law and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance insurance, including even welfare assistance, then this important passage in paragraph 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the conventions that, the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one of protocol, one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights under Article 6(1). And we would submit, like quite the converse. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation about one of protocol, one which avoids inequalities, treatment based on distinctions, which at the present day, imperial logical or unsustainable.
14	p1,01:17:52.940,01:20:01.620,spk_1,	True	Counsel: thus far, I support what the decision says, the reasons that are there given. But then, on the question of civil rights from paragraph five onwards where reference is made to Alconbury, Lord Bingham states at paragraph 6, the European courts approach to rights deriving from social welfare schemes has been complicated by differences of legal tradition in various Member States. As Lord Hoffman explained in Alconbury comparison Feldbrugge in the Netherlands and Deumeland in Germany in the 1986 with Salesi and Italy, and Mennitto and Italy shows movement from a narrower towards a broader interpretation of civil rights. Further cases made no doubt continue that trend to hold that the right enjoyed by Runa Begum, is a civil right for purposes of Article 6 would, however, to be go further than the Strasbourg court has yet gone. And I'm satisfied that in the light of a compelling argument on this point by Mr Salesi, the Secretary of State, that the decision of this court would not many means necessarily be favourable to Runa Begum so I prefer to assume without deciding that Runa Begum's domestic law right is also a civil right and to consider whether on that assumption. But having regard to the nature of the right. The statutory provisions of an appeal to the county court on a point of law satisfies the requirements. Article 6 although the county court jurisdictions appellate's substance the same as that of the high Court in judicial review. Thus the court may not only quashed the authority's decision under 243, it's held to be officiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith, but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable, or if the decision maker is shown to have misunderstood.
14	p3,00:44:52.090,00:51:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel: My lords. My lady. As your lordship’s know I am going to deal in its entirety with the first issue. Whether it's a civil right, I'm only going to deal with the second issue to the degree to make some supplementary comments, supplementary submissions to my friend Mr Arden's submissions. And then I will deal briefly with the matter of remedy. Where Mr Arden and I disagree, so far as the issue of Is this a civil right is concerned. Just so your lordships relationship know where I'm going. I'm going to deal first fairly quickly with the Strasbourg case law before Begum quickly because it's summarised in considerable depth in Begum. Then I will touch on Begum in relation to the civil rights issue. Then I will deal with the post Begum Strasbourg cases, then the Croydon case and lastly apply the tests to Part 7 of the Housing Act. Um, now in terms of the case law, up to Begum in respect of civil rights. First of all, it's important just to make clear there is no issue here that the claimants had some form of right, um, that's not disputed, and therefore the only question is whether it is a civil right within the meaning of Article 6. And it is, as your lordships will know very well clearly established that a civil right for the purposes of Article 6 is an autonomous concept. In other words, the way that it's described in domestic law is not determinative of whether it's a civil right or not, and again, to state what is certainly well known to my Lady Hale and my Lord I Hope from the Croydon case, Article 6 has extended into what English lawyers would consider two areas extended into what we would call public law in two ways. First of all, there are a series of cases about public law determinations which impact on private law rights, of which the classic examples are licencing. Decisions such as Kingsley planning decisions such as Brian and decisions relating to employment rights such as Albert and Lake Cont and into that category also now falls the case of Crompton, which relates to private law employment rights, albeit with a slight complication that it was a territorial army case. That line of cases in terms of is it a civil right is not what is an issue today. It's the second line of cases where there is a determination of a claim for a Social Security benefit, which is being suggested by my learned friends, has extended into Part 7 of the Housing Act and at that line of cases, really starts with the decision of the European court in a case called Felder Broker, which is in Volume 6 at tab 40. Uh huh and, yeah, Felda Brugger was a case concerning Dutch Social Security benefits, which were contributory benefits. In other words, the claimant had made payments under the equivalent of our national insurance scheme and whether her claim for the benefits fell within the term civil rights for Article 6 and I'll take your lordships in a moment to the key paragraphs. But the point of Felda Burger was that the European Court found that when it was a contributory benefits, it was directly analogous with a private insurance scheme benefit and therefore, in the same way that a private insurance scheme would give you the right to a would give a civil right and therefore Article 6 rights. If it was a contributory scheme, the same analysis must apply, and that's where one gets to Infeld a burger at paragraphs. Key part starts at page 8, paragraph 32. The European Court looks at the features of public law and says in 32 the first such factors as the character of the legislation. The legal rules governing Social Security benefits in the context of health insurance differ in many respects from the rules which apply to insurance in general, which are part of civil war civil law. The Netherlands state has assumed the responsibility of regulating the framework of the health health insurance scheme and overseeing the operation of that scheme. To this end, it specifies the categories of beneficiaries, defines the limits of the protection afforded, lays down the rates of the contributions and the allowances, et cetera, and that last sentence is important because it's picked up later in terms of the need for precise and clear rules. If one is to have an Article 6 civil right, then Paragraph 33 a second factor of relevance is the obligation to be insured against illness or, more precisely, the fact of being covered by insurance in the event of fulfilling the conditions laid down by the legislation. In other words, those concerned can either opt out of the benefits nor avoid having to pay the relevant contributions. And then, in 37 onwards, the court points to the private law features of the right and first of all, the personal and economic nature of the asserted right, a phrase which comes up again and again in the case law to begin with Paragraph 37. Mrs Feldberg was not affected in her relation with the public authorities as such acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, but in her personal capacity as a private individual, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming a right flowing from the specific rules laid down by the legislation in force. For the individual averting it such a right is often a crucial importance. This is especially so in the case of health insurance benefits, when the employee who is unable to work by reason of illness enjoys no other source of income. In short, the right in question was a personal, economic and individual right factor that brought it close to the civil sphere. And they go on in 38 to talk about the relationship with the employment contract, thus tying it in at that stage into private law rights. And then,
14	p3,01:59:43.820,02:06:10.770,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes, my Lord, I'll come well, the boundary point in my submission all flows back to Brian and taking into account those different criteria on breach. And I'll come to that when I come to breach. But yes, in my submission, what Lord Bingham and Hoffman said in Begum about being on the edge and engagement reflecting on Bridge goes back to Brian. And that, in turn, goes back to Mr Bratt's opinion. Brian, uh, just staying on Croydon for a moment. Uh, paragraph 45 of Lady Hale's opinion. Uh, if this is a civil right at all, therefore I'd be inclined to hold that it rests at the periphery of such rights the same point again. And then, my Lord Lord, hold. Yeah. Who, if I may say so with respect was slightly more definite on the point paragraphs 61 62 mhm 61. I read this passage as an endorsement of the points that passage in Rutabagas We've looked at on a number of occasions that Lord Lord Bingham made in Rana Begum that if an elastic interpretation is given to the Article 61 concept of civil rights, flexibility must also be given to the procedural requirements of that article. If over judicial isation of the administrative welfare scheme is to be avoided. But it is important to to recognise that in Sofia is in room to begin the question. If so, at what point administrative welfare schemes fall outside. The scope of Article 61 was not tested. Sofia, as I've said, fell within the mainstream of cases about social security and welfare benefits in room to begin the House preferred not to take a decision on this issue. 62. There are, however, a number of straws in the wind that has been generated by the decisions from Strasbourg since Reena Begum. That suggests that a distinction can now be made between the class of Social Security and welfare benefits that is of a kind exemplified by so lazy and those benefits which are, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgement by the relevant authority. The phrase civil rights is, of course, an autonomous concepts, the wound room. But it does convey the idea of what in stack the Strasbourg court referred to as an assessor to bill right in that paragraph, having declared that the convention must be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its provisions and in Paragraph 49 that it's in the interest of the convention as a whole, that the autonomous concept of possession in a one P one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights, the court said. And I've already read your lordships. That passage then 63 reference to luas. Oh, to a private right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law and to an individual right of which the applicant may consider him the holder himself. The holder are consistent with this approach. So, too, are the references in Manito to a right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law. Where the court added, the dispute must be genuine and serious. It may relate not only to the actual existence of the right to also do its scope and manner of exercise. The outcome. The proceedings must be directly decisive with the writing question cases where the award of benefit is dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and, if so, how the need for it has assessed ought to be met. Do not answer that description. The exact limits of the autonomous concept remain elusive. One can be confident that cases where the relationship between the beneficiary, the public authority, is a public law character, as in one room where the role of the applicant associations in regard to the construction and maintenance of public housing was over. Typically, general interest character fall outside the scope Mr Howell submitted. There's no distinction to be drawn between the forms in which welfare benefits may be provided. But none of the Strasbourg authorities goes that far. And the carefully worded passages from Suazo and Stack, to which I have referred, seemed to me to contradict his proposition. The series of cases about the enforcement of judgments made by the courts about social housing in Russia, to which he referred of which the latest is Nogovitsyn, offer no assistance as the question whether a duty to provide social housing gives rise to a civil right was not argued for these reasons. I think it can now be asserted with reasonable confidence that the duty of the local authority under Section 21 of the 1989 to provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of the factors mentioned in that subsection does not give rise to a civil right within the meaning of Article 61 of the convention. So my lords, in my submission that comes as close as this house caught in its previous guys was has been prepared to come to what is a civil right? Can I then turn to pull those submissions together in respect of the scheme under Part seven, and just point to what, in my submission, are the three critical elements as to why this isn't a civil right? Firstly, the series of highly evaluative judgments along the way to getting the right and I'll go to those in a second. Secondly, the way the right is met or discharged itself involves discretionary judgments. And thirdly, the circumstances in which the right can be lost or the duty can be discharged involves again highly evaluative judgments. Yeah, so I'm going to take this speedily because your Lordships have already looked at the scheme twice. But in terms of that first heading the series of highly judgmental decisions along the way to getting the right section of the act, of course, is that Volume one tabloid?
14	p3,01:56:15.510,01:59:23.660,spk_2,	True	Counsel: And in Sofia, the UK government didn't contest that Article 61 was engaged and in my submission, very strongly. Contrary to what my learning from Mr Gowdy has said, there is a complete dick contrast for these purposes between the Housing benefit Scheme and rights under Part seven of the Housing Act to housing housing benefit is a cash benefit. It is subject to a precise set of legally hard edged criteria, and once one is entitled, there is an arithmetical calculation as to what one is entitled to in terms of amount. It therefore stands on all falls with Benito, and in my submission, it is utterly different. For the purposes of Article 61 from mhm the part seven rights before I make submissions on part seven. Specifically, Can I just ask your Lordships briefly to look at em in Croydon? In respect of civil rights? Of course, the comments in the opinions are over to there because, uh, your Lordships, tomorrow day after tomorrow, we're going to find against the secretary of state on and against the respondents on domestic point. But both my Lady Hale and Lord Hope did deal with civil rights, albeit briefly. First of all, Lady Hale at paragraph 39 refers to Bagan refers to, uh, the Russian cases and refers to so lazy and then in paragraph 40 um, first to the Russian cases not being based on any argument and then at the bottom of page 24 any entitlement under Section 21 that's the Children Act, which was an issue in that case, does not depend upon discretion. But it does depend upon an evaluation of some very soft criteria rather than specific rules. And it is difficult to say at what point the applicant may consider himself to be the holder of such a right. Hence, as my Lord Walker observed in Rana Begum, if they write, such as this is a civil right at all. It must lie close to the boundary of the concept and not at the core of what it entails. If so, this may have consequences for the second question, which is what Article six requires. And in my submission, the same points would be made here. If you get a right under Part seven, it is subject to some very soft criteria, and I'll come back to that in a moment.

There are therefore various forms of tenure, which will which will suffice. Um, but it is a tenancy that will be forthcoming. We respectfully submit that the position is as stated by Baroness Hale, then Lady Justice Hale in the Adan v Newham case, not the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal. But in our submission the correct view. Um, well, that's in Volume 3 of the authorities at the first case in that volume at 10. And Lady Justice Hale. Judgement begins paragraph 52 that page 2136 of the law report. And at the bottom of that page, article 61 is set out and then over the top of the next page miss Booth has accepted for the purpose of this hearing that the determination of an application for accommodation for for assistance in obtaining accommodation under Part seven is the determination of his civil rights and obligations and then continuing. The European Court of Human Rights has held that the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance, including even welfare assistance see Schuler-Zgraggen, see also Feldbrugge and Deumeland . Those cases were concerned what we would call social security benefits. But the court pointed out that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, the applicant was not only affected in her relations with the administrative authorities as such, but also suffered an interference with her means of subsistence. She was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in case of Germany in a federal statute and then continuing with the judgement to claim for accommodation under part 7 is also it is accepted for present purposes, such a right once the locals and then this is the key passage. Once the local authority are satisfied that the statutory criteria for providing accommodation exists, they have no discretion. They have to provide its irrespective of local conditions of demand and supply, hence this is more akin to a claim for Social Security benefits than it is a claim for social or other services where the authorities have a greater degree of discretion and resource considerations may also be relevant. Nevertheless, as Miss Booth points out the nature of the decision making process required by Article 61 differs according to the nature of the right being claimed, referring to Albert v Belgium adopting the concept of full jurisdiction. As Lord Hoffmann explained in Alconbury, subsequent European authorities shows the full jurisdiction does not mean full decision making power. It means full jurisdiction to deal with the case, as the nature of the decision requires. In assessing the sufficiency of the decision making process, under part seven must be relevant that authorities, with all the internal external controls to which they are subject to involved. On the other hand, decisions to house the homeless are quite different. The Secretary of State's decisions and planning and compulsory purchase with which the House of Lords was concerned, and Alconbury in that case, Will Hoffman drew a distinction between policy decisions what interest requires, which one would expect. One would expect to be taken by democratically accountable bodies and the determination of rights and then a short quotation followed by this. Decisions are under part seven of the 1996 Act's and not in any sense policy decisions as to what the public interest requires. And the policy decisions were taken by Parliament when it enacted the 1996 Act. Individual eligibility decisions are taken in the first instance by local housing authorities. But policy questions to the availability of resources or equity between the homeless and those on the waiting list for social housing are irrelevant to individual eligibility. Or we respectfully adopt all of that. My Lord, while we have the case to hand later on in the judgement of Lady Justice Hale observations.
14	p3,02:13:30.150,02:14:54.160,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Well, my lord, I'll check that over lunch and come back because I don't want to speculate and get it wrong. So, my lords, in my submission, for all those reasons we see a scheme under part seven, which is, although the duty itself is not subject to the discretion and as much as once you have the right section 1935 puts a duty on the local authority not a power. But whether you get the right precisely, the forms of the right, and how you lose the right to highly judgmental, starkly contrasted with anything that the European Court has found falls within Article 61 and then finally on engagement. My Lord, My Lords, I do want to stress the point that was made very strongly in Croydon. If Article 61 is engaged by a claim under Part seven, then it is very difficult to see why it would not also be engaged by a series of other local authority decisions in the area of welfare. And the most obvious ones are those under the National Assistance Act.

In the instant case, the most important of these lies in the fact that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, Mrs Salahi was not affected and her relations with the administrative authorities as such. Acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute giving effect to the Constitution. Um, so that's where the law has got to on Social Security benefits, My lords, your lordships, no minuto Is that volume 7 tab 48 but I don't think it's necessary to go to that effectively repeats the Celozzi tasks. And in my submission, what comes out of those tests? Those case law up to that stage is that in order to fall within Article 61, it needs to be an economic and individual right. It needs to be a right flowing from specific rules, and it needs to be a right arising from a scheme where there is no discretion in the method of meeting the right. So just to counter submission, that was certainly made strongly in Croydon. The issue is not whether the right is something that is important to somebody. It might be very important, but that doesn't make it a civil right.

14	p3,01:02:22.500,01:05:16.650,spk_2,	True	Counsel: This is a highly discretionary scheme. If you go to the top of page 456 in paragraph 67 the whole scheme is shot through with discretions, in which either the council's duty is dependent upon being satisfied of some state of affairs or can be discharged in various ways of its own choosing. By contrast, in Manito, the court said that the management committee of the local Public Health Service, after verifying that the applicant satisfied the conditions for entitlement to the allowance, should simply have made an arithmetical calculation of the quantum. So the discretionary elements in Part 7 were, in Lord Hoffman's view, extremely important. And it it's important to recognise the discretionary elements on a whole series of the stages in the Part seven decision making process. And then, in 69 between, uh, in about the sixth Line, he makes the same point as Lord Bingham that to accept this case, a part 7 claim, as being a civil right would be to go further than Strasburg has gone. And then he's in 70. He says he's not going to decide it. Then, looking briefly at the other members of the Judicial Committee, My Lord, Lord Hope Page 73 agreed with Lord Bingham and Lord Lord Hoffmann. Lord Millett also addressed civil rights in some detail, and the key concluding paragraphs are 90 onwards, where he deals with Silesia, Silesian Minuto, Felder Burger and 91. He says the present case undoubtedly goes further. Still, it has four features which take it beyond the existing law. It's benefiting kind. It involves priority between competing claimants for a finite amount of housing stock. Three. The Housing Authority has a discretion as to the manner in which it discharges its duty. And four ultimately, the question for determination calls for an exercise of judgement. And they're 92 he analyses those. And then, at the end, he says, Rana Begum cannot be said to be claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. He then, to be fair, says in 94. But he's persuaded by these considerations are extending the scope of Article 61 is a desirable end, but needs to go hand in hand with moderating the requirements in the interests of administration, where administrative decisions are involved and then says in the unsettled light of the case law, content to assume without deciding civil right.

And then I will deal briefly with the matter of remedy. Where Mr Arden and I disagree, so far as the issue of Is this a civil right is concerned. Just so your lordships relationship know where I'm going. I'm going to deal first fairly quickly with the Strasbourg case law before Begum quickly because it's summarised in considerable depth in Begum. Then I will touch on Begum in relation to the civil rights issue. Then I will deal with the post Begum Strasbourg cases, then the Croydon case and lastly apply the tests to Part 7 of the Housing Act. Um, now in terms of the case law, up to Begum in respect of civil rights. First of all, it's important just to make clear there is no issue here that the claimants had some form of right, um, that's not disputed, and therefore the only question is whether it is a civil right within the meaning of Article 6. And it is, as your lordships will know very well clearly established that a civil right for the purposes of Article 6 is an autonomous concept. In other words, the way that it's described in domestic law is not determinative of whether it's a civil right or not, and again, to state what is certainly well known to my Lady Hale and my Lord I Hope from the Croydon case, Article 6 has extended into what English lawyers would consider two areas extended into what we would call public law in two ways. First of all, there are a series of cases about public law determinations which impact on private law rights, of which the classic examples are licencing. Decisions such as Kingsley planning decisions such as Brian and decisions relating to employment rights such as Albert and Lake Cont and into that category also now falls the case of Crompton, which relates to private law employment rights, albeit with a slight complication that it was a territorial army case. That line of cases in terms of is it a civil right is not what is an issue today. It's the second line of cases where there is a determination of a claim for a Social Security benefit, which is being suggested by my learned friends, has extended into Part 7 of the Housing Act and at that line of cases, really starts with the decision of the European court in a case called Felder Broker, which is in Volume 6 at tab 40. Uh huh and, yeah, Felda Brugger was a case concerning Dutch Social Security benefits, which were contributory benefits. In other words, the claimant had made payments under the equivalent of our national insurance scheme and whether her claim for the benefits fell within the term civil rights for Article 6 and I'll take your lordships in a moment to the key paragraphs. But the point of Felda Burger was that the European Court found that when it was a contributory benefits, it was directly analogous with a private insurance scheme benefit and therefore, in the same way that a private insurance scheme would give you the right to a would give a civil right and therefore Article 6 rights. If it was a contributory scheme, the same analysis must apply, and that's where one gets to Infeld a burger at paragraphs. Key part starts at page 8, paragraph 32. The European Court looks at the features of public law and says in 32 the first such factors as the character of the legislation. The legal rules governing Social Security benefits in the context of health insurance differ in many respects from the rules which apply to insurance in general, which are part of civil war civil law. The Netherlands state has assumed the responsibility of regulating the framework of the health health insurance scheme and overseeing the operation of that scheme. To this end, it specifies the categories of beneficiaries, defines the limits of the protection afforded, lays down the rates of the contributions and the allowances, et cetera, and that last sentence is important because it's picked up later in terms of the need for precise and clear rules. If one is to have an Article 6 civil right, then Paragraph 33 a second factor of relevance is the obligation to be insured against illness or, more precisely, the fact of being covered by insurance in the event of fulfilling the conditions laid down by the legislation. In other words, those concerned can either opt out of the benefits nor avoid having to pay the relevant contributions. And then, in 37 onwards, the court points to the private law features of the right and first of all, the personal and economic nature of the asserted right, a phrase which comes up again and again in the case law to begin with Paragraph 37. Mrs Feldberg was not affected in her relation with the public authorities as such acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, but in her personal capacity as a private individual, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming a right flowing from the specific rules laid down by the legislation in force. For the individual averting it such a right is often a crucial importance. This is especially so in the case of health insurance benefits, when the employee who is unable to work by reason of illness enjoys no other source of income. In short, the right in question was a personal, economic and individual right factor that brought it close to the civil sphere. And they go on in 38 to talk about the relationship with the employment contract, thus tying it in at that stage into private law rights.
15	p3,01:41:47.220,01:44:37.450,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The court has already found that the Italian military internees cannot claim to have a legitimate expectation of compensation for the detention and forced labour and the fact that issue therefore do not fall within the ambit of Article 1 Protocol 1. This finding is not contradicted by the court's judgement. In the case of Stack. In that case, the court held non contributory social benefits funded by General taxation fall within the scope of Article 1 Protocol 1. The court decided that although that provision does not grant the right to receive a Social Security payment of any kind, if a state does decide to establish a benefit scheme, it must do so in a matter of compatible with Article 14, subsequently confirmed by the Grand Chamber. However, the present case is distinguishable from the case of Stack for the following reasons. It's true that both the present case and the case of stack concerned non contributory benefits which are partly funded by general taxation. However, while the case of STEC dealt with a supplementary regular payment and a regular retirement pension in the framework of Social Security, the subject of the instant case is a one off grant, one off payment granted as compensation for events which had occurred even before the convention entered into force and represented in a wider sense a settlement of damages caused by the Second World War. The payments were made outside the framework of social security legislation and cannot be likened to the payments in stack. So, my Lord, so far as I'm aware, this is the only post stack case on Article 1 protocol 1 that takes the matter any further forward. But what it makes clear in terms is that Steck was not intended to open the gates on our ambit of Article 1 protocol 1 to any form of state assistance or benefit in whatever form. And in my submission. If the European Court is drawing a distinction between a cash payment made to force labourers in the Second World War and saying, Well, that's outside the confines of STEC, then in my submission it would necessarily follow that a discretion, a scheme with a series of evaluative judgments where the benefit is a benefit in kind would also fall outside. The terms of step is quite right to say there are other issues that arise in the Italian case that don't arise here, and one can say there were a number of factors. One was the fact that the scheme had come into a related to events well before the convention, and the other was that it was a very particular factual situation. But in my submission, it gives the lie to my learned friend Mr [inaudible]'s submission.
15	p3,01:56:15.510,01:59:23.660,spk_2,	True	Counsel: specifically for housing costs. And in Sofia, the UK government didn't contest that Article 61 was engaged and in my submission, very strongly. Contrary to what my learning from Mr Gowdy has said, there is a complete dick contrast for these purposes between the Housing benefit Scheme and rights under Part seven of the Housing Act to housing housing benefit is a cash benefit. It is subject to a precise set of legally hard edged criteria, and once one is entitled, there is an arithmetical calculation as to what one is entitled to in terms of amount. It therefore stands on all falls with Benito, and in my submission, it is utterly different. For the purposes of Article 61 from mhm the part seven rights before I make submissions on part seven. Specifically, Can I just ask your Lordships briefly to look at em in Croydon? In respect of civil rights? Of course, the comments in the opinions are over to there because, uh, your Lordships, tomorrow day after tomorrow, we're going to find against the secretary of state on and against the respondents on domestic point. But both my Lady Hale and Lord Hope did deal with civil rights, albeit briefly. First of all, Lady Hale at paragraph 39 refers to Bagan refers to, uh, the Russian cases and refers to so lazy and then in paragraph 40 um, first to the Russian cases not being based on any argument and then at the bottom of page 24 any entitlement under Section 21 that's the Children Act, which was an issue in that case, does not depend upon discretion. But it does depend upon an evaluation of some very soft criteria rather than specific rules. And it is difficult to say at what point the applicant may consider himself to be the holder of such a right. Hence, as my Lord Walker observed in Rana Begum, if they write, such as this is a civil right at all. It must lie close to the boundary of the concept and not at the core of what it entails. If so, this may have consequences for the second question, which is what Article six requires. And in my submission, the same points would be made here. If you get a right under Part seven, it is subject to some very soft criteria, and I'll come back to that in a moment.

15	p3,01:10:57.320,01:11:53.560,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Are the council involved, one would assume that in the vast majority of housing cases it will be arguments about suitability which will come to the fall at this stage won't be an argument about Did I get the letter or not? It will be arguments about that. Black wasn't suitable for various reasons. And doubtless that's why the review officer focused on that issue. So, yeah, in my submission, Begum, although I freely except it was over to deal with the issue in a great deal of detail and point to a whole series of reasons why to extend civil right to apart seven claim would be to go beyond Strasbourg. I turned them to the post strapped to the post Begum cases. Um, and Reliance is placed by my learned friend Mr Gowdy as it was by Mr Howell in Croydon on that series of Russian and Ukrainian cases, which substantively concerned state housing in various forms.
15	p3,01:59:43.820,02:06:10.770,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes, my Lord, I'll come well, the boundary point in my submission all flows back to Brian and taking into account those different criteria on breach. And I'll come to that when I come to breach. But yes, in my submission, what Lord Bingham and Hoffman said in Begum about being on the edge and engagement reflecting on Bridge goes back to Brian. And that, in turn, goes back to Mr Bratt's opinion. Brian, uh, just staying on Croydon for a moment. Uh, paragraph 45 of Lady Hale's opinion. Uh, if this is a civil right at all, therefore I'd be inclined to hold that it rests at the periphery of such rights the same point again. And then, my Lord Lord, hold. Yeah. Who, if I may say so with respect was slightly more definite on the point paragraphs 61 62 mhm 61. I read this passage as an endorsement of the points that passage in Rutabagas We've looked at on a number of occasions that Lord Lord Bingham made in Rana Begum that if an elastic interpretation is given to the Article 61 concept of civil rights, flexibility must also be given to the procedural requirements of that article. If over judicial isation of the administrative welfare scheme is to be avoided. But it is important to to recognise that in Sofia is in room to begin the question. If so, at what point administrative welfare schemes fall outside. The scope of Article 61 was not tested. Sofia, as I've said, fell within the mainstream of cases about social security and welfare benefits in room to begin the House preferred not to take a decision on this issue. 62. There are, however, a number of straws in the wind that has been generated by the decisions from Strasbourg since Reena Begum. That suggests that a distinction can now be made between the class of Social Security and welfare benefits that is of a kind exemplified by so lazy and those benefits which are, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgement by the relevant authority. The phrase civil rights is, of course, an autonomous concepts, the wound room. But it does convey the idea of what in stack the Strasbourg court referred to as an assessor to bill right in that paragraph, having declared that the convention must be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its provisions and in Paragraph 49 that it's in the interest of the convention as a whole, that the autonomous concept of possession in a one P one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights, the court said. And I've already read your lordships. That passage then 63 reference to luas. Oh, to a private right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law and to an individual right of which the applicant may consider him the holder himself. The holder are consistent with this approach. So, too, are the references in Manito to a right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law. Where the court added, the dispute must be genuine and serious. It may relate not only to the actual existence of the right to also do its scope and manner of exercise. The outcome. The proceedings must be directly decisive with the writing question cases where the award of benefit is dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and, if so, how the need for it has assessed ought to be met. Do not answer that description. The exact limits of the autonomous concept remain elusive. One can be confident that cases where the relationship between the beneficiary, the public authority, is a public law character, as in one room where the role of the applicant associations in regard to the construction and maintenance of public housing was over. Typically, general interest character fall outside the scope Mr Howell submitted. There's no distinction to be drawn between the forms in which welfare benefits may be provided. But none of the Strasbourg authorities goes that far. And the carefully worded passages from Suazo and Stack, to which I have referred, seemed to me to contradict his proposition. The series of cases about the enforcement of judgments made by the courts about social housing in Russia, to which he referred of which the latest is Nogovitsyn, offer no assistance as the question whether a duty to provide social housing gives rise to a civil right was not argued for these reasons. I think it can now be asserted with reasonable confidence that the duty of the local authority under Section 21 of the 1989 to provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of the factors mentioned in that subsection does not give rise to a civil right within the meaning of Article 61 of the convention. So my lords, in my submission that comes as close as this house caught in its previous guys was has been prepared to come to what is a civil right? Can I then turn to pull those submissions together in respect of the scheme under Part seven, and just point to what, in my submission, are the three critical elements as to why this isn't a civil right? Firstly, the series of highly evaluative judgments along the way to getting the right and I'll go to those in a second. Secondly, the way the right is met or discharged itself involves discretionary judgments. And thirdly, the circumstances in which the right can be lost or the duty can be discharged involves again highly evaluative judgments. Yeah, so I'm going to take this speedily because your Lordships have already looked at the scheme twice. But in terms of that first heading the series of highly judgmental decisions along the way to getting the right section of the act, of course, is that Volume one tabloid?
15	p4,01:09:10.569,01:10:59.870,spk_2,	True	Counsel: My Lords and my Lady, as regards whether the appellant undoubted rights are civil rights, it's now, of course, firmly established that rights are not prevented from being civil rights because they have a public nature. The law has, as Miss Lieven accepts, moved on since in Feldbrugge and the test is as stated in Salesi and Minnetto as regards social security and, uh, in our submission social welfare benefits, that is, is one talking about an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. That is the test upon which we seek to rely. And Strasbourg has not carved out an exclusion for benefits in kind. On the contrary, it has extended property rights by accepting in a series of cases that a property right can be constituted by a legitimate expectation. And that is supported by the Italian POW case in an earlier passage than those to which the court's attention had been drawn so far, Paragraph 62 and 64 referring to Kopecky and as the court has seen by the Teteriny line of authorities to Teteriny itself at paragraphs 45 to 47. But here, the right is more crystallised and stronger than simply a legitimate expectation. If the criteria are satisfied, then the right exists, there is no discretion. There is a duty.
15	p1,00:08:40.680,00:12:09.660,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord. Certainly, I'm going to come to the question of a practical considerations, which weighed heavily with the Court of Appeal and indeed with the judges in the county court and my Lord the, but in our submission put shortly there is. It is a perfectly workable arrangement, if that is what is needed, that one has certain aspects decided in one way and others in another. My Lord, my sixth. That preliminary point was the well, it's the point that I've made that the about yes, the seventh is that although, and this indeed is the point. Lady Hale has already raised that, although both the Ali and Ibrahim cases involved the issue of whether a particular letter has been received. Of course, cases that turn only on the resolution of fact can arise in other ways. In the homelessness context of which Tomlinson is an example, and my Lords and my Lady, this leaves 2 areas of major controversy. There is a third area of controversy in relation to remedy, whether it must be a declaration of incompatibility or not. But on the substance of the matter. Two major issues first were the council's adverse credibility findings against both appellants and consequent abandonment of the councils housing duties towards the appellant determinations of civil rights of the appellant's for Article six purposes. That is therefore, the determination not only at rights which plainly they are but of civil rights. We submit that they were civil rights that matters, what the Housing Act conferred, and secondly, if so, does Article six require a full merits review. In our submission, It does, in a case which turns on a simple question of primary fact with no specialist expertise required to determine it and no element of policy or discretion involved in the determination. Well, this latter submission well, the former submission involves the determination of a case that was not determined as such in Runa Begum, but was the assumption upon which the house proceeded. The latter submission involves either distinguishing or overruling the decision of the House of Lords in the Runa Begum case on suitability of accommodation. My Lord, another way of putting that submission is that it gives effect to the decision of the Strasbourg court in Tsfayo, in the UK and now also, we would say to the very recent and important decision of the Strasbourg court in Crompton and the UK a decision more recent even than our printed case, my Lord before coming in a moment to the first issue that is determination of civil rights. I should perhaps say a word about the composite expression in Article 6, an independent and impartial tribunal. 
15	p2,00:07:54.940,00:10:29.780,spk_0,	True	Counsel: They did provide sufficiency of review in a number of cases against the United Kingdom, and they're then mentioned, including the Stefan and Kingsley cases, so one sees that Bryan is explained by reference to specialised area of law and expertise of the inspector in relevant respect in Paragraph 73. However, in Tsfayo, the court reached a different conclusion, concluding that the decision-making process was significantly different from previous cases. Whereas in Bryan, the issue, to be determined required a measure of professional knowledge or experience and the exercise of administrative discretion pursuant to wider policy aims. In Tsfayo, the board was deciding a simple question of fact, namely, whether there was good cause the applicants delay in making a benefit claim. On this question, the applicant have given evidence to the board, at the first she knew that anything was amiss, that her claim was when she received a notice from her housing association landlord to repossess because the rent was in arrears. The board found her explanation to be unconvincing and rejected her claim for back payment of benefit essentially on the basis of their assessment of her credibility. No specialist expertise was required to determine this issue, nor could the factual findings in Tsfayo be said to be merely incidental to the reaching broader judgments of policy or expediency, which it was for the democratically accountable authority to take. Accordingly, the court concluded that judicial review proceedings did not offer, in the circumstances raised in Tsfayo sufficiency of review in light of the fact that the High court had no jurisdiction to re-hear the evidence or substitute its own views as to the applicant's credibility. As a result, the central issue in the dispute was not determined by an independent and impartial tribunal. So one sees there that Tsfayo is characterised as concerning a simple question of fact, based on an assessment of credibility, not requiring specialist expertise and not incidental to the reaching of broader judgments of policy or expediency. And then the court goes on to the application of the general principles to the facts of the case. And one sees at paragraph 77 that the court considers that there is a legitimate concern that the Army board lacked the necessary structural independence.
15	p3,00:55:39.340,00:57:09.460,spk_2,	True	Counsel: as in the two cases previously referred to, other considerations argue in favour of the applicability of Article 61. In the instant case, the most important of these lies in the fact that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, Mrs Salahi was not affected and her relations with the administrative authorities as such. Acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute giving effect to the Constitution. Um, so that's where the law has got to on Social Security benefits, My lords, your lordships, no minuto Is that volume 7 tab 48 but I don't think it's necessary to go to that effectively repeats the Celozzi tasks. And in my submission, what comes out of those tests? Those case law up to that stage is that in order to fall within Article 61, it needs to be an economic and individual right. It needs to be a right flowing from specific rules, and it needs to be a right arising from a scheme where there is no discretion in the method of meeting the right. So just to counter submission, that was certainly made strongly in Croydon. The issue is not whether the right is something that is important to somebody. It might be very important, but that doesn't make it a civil right?
15	p4,00:57:53.030,01:02:02.840,spk_2,	True	Counsel: My Lords, My Lady. The fundamental point we submit on these appeals is that the law has moved on since Runa Begum. The Strasbourg decisions in Tsfayo and now Cromptom strike a rather, if not very different note. My learned friend Mr. Arden relied heavily yesterday afternoon on the speech by Lord Hoffmann in Runa Begum. If, however, one takes Lord Hoffman's approach in Runa Begum in its entirety and applies it to the facts in Tsfayo, then Mrs. Tsfayo loses. But of course, Mrs. Tsfayo, in fact, won. Mr. Arden emphasised in particular, paragraph 56 in Lord Hoffman's speech, and especially the statement that a limited review of the facts is sufficient in those areas of the law. such as regulatory and welfare schemes in which decision making is customarily entrusted to administrators. That approach, applied to housing benefit, would yield the answer that Mrs Tsfayo should have failed. What Lord Hoffman said in that respect is capable of applying every bit as much to housing benefit as to homelessness. But although in Runa Begum, homelessness lost. In Tsfayo, housing benefit won. So assuming Runa Begum, as well as Tsfayo, to be correctly decided, the distinction must be something other than the homelessness scheme on the one hand and the housing benefit scheme on the other hand. The distinction must be the distinction we suggest, made in Tsfayo itself, the distinction between expertise/ discretion issues such as suitability on the one hand and fact issues, on the other hand, such as in both Tsfayo and the present appeals. And indeed, we respectfully suggest that the approach should not be to ask oneself what is the least extent to which one has to chip away from Runa Begum, the approach should be to ask oneself, are the principles in Tsfayo applicable to the present case, or is the present case distinguishable from Tsfayo? If the music had stopped with Tsfayo, we submit that the answer is clearly that the present appeals of Tsfayo cases not Runa Begum cases. And if there were any doubt about that, it's entirely dispelled by the way in which Tsfayo has now been dealt with in Crompton. Lord Kingsley in the United Kingdom, the Gaming Board case, is a clear instance of the case on the other side of the line from Tsfayo and these appeals, that is, it is a case on the Runa Begum side of the line. Kingsley, of course, having been concerned with who is a fit and proper person and that, of course, being akin to what is or is not suitable accommodation. These, on the other hand, the present appeals are cases where, unlike in Runa Begum and Kingsley in cases of that sort, the factual issues are not incidental but are discrete. In Runa Begum, Lord Hoffmann at paragraph 51 52 and 56 described the decision as to suitability as the subject matter of the decision and as a classic exercise of administrative discretion. Here, the subject matter is entirely different. It is not suitability. And it is not something else, which is a classic exercise of administrative discretion.
15	p1,01:35:56.960,01:36:38.100,spk_1,	True	Counsel: We rely on that, of course, and say there's no reason why the general provisions shouldn't apply in this particular case. And one sees that general proposition is supported in footnote 16 by reference to Salesi and Mennitto v Italy, and Schuler-Zgraggen and Switzerland and paragraph 40 continues. The court agrees with the parties the applicants claim for housing benefit concerned the determination of the civil rights from the Article 6(1) applied. So although that wasn't an issue, the court did express its agreement as that the applicants, therefore, had a right to a fair hearing before an independent part of funeral. 
15	p1,01:23:56.180,01:25:48.150,spk_1,	True	Court: Yeah, just refer briefly, if I may, to 27 but that's really on the point of Independent tribunal. So it is paragraph 28. I returned to the other two issue in dispute, and then refers to how they may relate to each other, referring to a dissenting opinion in Feldbrugge. Then in paragraph 29, the Strasbourg court has been left to develop the law. It's done so in two ways. First, it's been concerned to ensure that State parties do not exploit the gap left in Article 6 by changing their laws so as to convert a question which would ordinarily be regarded as appropriate. The civil adjudication into an administrative decision outside the reach of the article has done this by treating civil rights and obligations as an autonomous concept not dependent upon the domestic law, classification, right or obligation, which the citizens should have access to a court to determine, referring to Goudie in paragraph 30. The second development has been the doctrine, starting with Ringeisen in Austria in 1971 by which the Strasbourg court has extended Article 6 to cover a wide range of administrative decision making on the ground that the decision determines or decisively affects rights or obligations in private law. In a reference to Alconbury and then more recently, the scope of Article 6 has also been extended to public law rights, such as entitlement to Social Security or Welfare Benefit, and the publicly funded statutory schemes on the ground that they closely resemble writes in private law, referring to Salesi v Italy.

15	p1,01:01:45.110,01:06:50.990,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And indeed, of course, commonly authorities will not actually be providing the accommodation themselves, but will be securing it through nominations to registered social landlords or in a variety of means. There are therefore various forms of tenure, which will which will suffice. Um, but it is a tenancy that will be forthcoming. We respectfully submit that the position is as stated by Baroness Hale, then Lady Justice Hale in the Adan v Newham case, not the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal. But in our submission the correct view. Um, well, that's in Volume 3 of the authorities at the first case in that volume at 10. And Lady Justice Hale. Judgement begins paragraph 52 that page 2136 of the law report. And at the bottom of that page, article 61 is set out and then over the top of the next page miss Booth has accepted for the purpose of this hearing that the determination of an application for accommodation for for assistance in obtaining accommodation under Part seven is the determination of his civil rights and obligations and then continuing. The European Court of Human Rights has held that the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance, including even welfare assistance see Schuler-Zgraggen, see also Feldbrugge and Deumeland . Those cases were concerned what we would call social security benefits. But the court pointed out that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, the applicant was not only affected in her relations with the administrative authorities as such, but also suffered an interference with her means of subsistence. She was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in case of Germany in a federal statute and then continuing with the judgement to claim for accommodation under part 7 is also it is accepted for present purposes, such a right once the locals and then this is the key passage. Once the local authority are satisfied that the statutory criteria for providing accommodation exists, they have no discretion. They have to provide its irrespective of local conditions of demand and supply, hence this is more akin to a claim for Social Security benefits than it is a claim for social or other services where the authorities have a greater degree of discretion and resource considerations may also be relevant. Nevertheless, as Miss Booth points out the nature of the decision making process required by Article 61 differs according to the nature of the right being claimed, referring to Albert v Belgium adopting the concept of full jurisdiction. As Lord Hoffmann explained in Alconbury, subsequent European authorities shows the full jurisdiction does not mean full decision making power. It means full jurisdiction to deal with the case, as the nature of the decision requires. In assessing the sufficiency of the decision making process, under part seven must be relevant that authorities, with all the internal external controls to which they are subject to involved. On the other hand, decisions to house the homeless are quite different. The Secretary of State's decisions and planning and compulsory purchase with which the House of Lords was concerned, and Alconbury in that case, Will Hoffman drew a distinction between policy decisions what interest requires, which one would expect. One would expect to be taken by democratically accountable bodies and the determination of rights and then a short quotation followed by this. Decisions are under part seven of the 1996 Act's and not in any sense policy decisions as to what the public interest requires. And the policy decisions were taken by Parliament when it enacted the 1996 Act. Individual eligibility decisions are taken in the first instance by local housing authorities. But policy questions to the availability of resources or equity between the homeless and those on the waiting list for social housing are irrelevant to individual eligibility. Or we respectfully adopt all of that. My Lord, while we have the case to hand later on in the judgement of Lady Justice Hale observations which in our submission are relevant on the question.

16	p3,01:39:50.410,01:41:45.710,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes, I'm sorry. I've never spotted that. Yes, it's all about the Second World War, and it's about the period when the Italians and the Germans fell out and the Germans forced a number of Italians to go to Germany to work as forced labour. But the point of the case is that the scheme excluded prisoners of war and the claimants were prisoners of war, and they argued that the claims fell within the ambit of Article 1 protocol 1. And then they sought to argue under Article 14 that it was discriminatory, without justification in respect of prisoners of war. And one can paragraph 16. Uh huh. On August the 11th, 2001, the applicant association of former Italian military internee, Um and Mr Fiorini has been subject to forced labour as a civilian lodged a constitutional complaint. And one can see that the top of page 149 bottom have paid one full rate the conditions of eligibility. And it was the third limb which was the problematic one. Prisoner of war status does not entitle to benefit. So that was the substance of the complaint.
16	p2,00:17:59.260,00:18:40.860,spk_0,	True	Counsel: There is a discretion as to the level of compensation and so forth. However, unlike the cases of Bryan and X, the exercise of that discretion did not benefit from any specialist knowledge offered by the members of the tribunal in question. Accordingly, there was no compelling reason for the decision on the level of compensation to be made by the Army board rather than by an independent and impartial tribunal. In this respect, therefore, the court considers that the circumstances are similar to those in Tsfayo. There will therefore be a breach of Article six unless in the particular circumstances of the case, the judicial review proceedings offered sufficiency of review. 
16	p3,01:52:43.610,01:54:01.230,spk_2,	True	Counsel: I think the answer, my lady, I could be wrong about this, but I think the answer lies in paragraph 84 may analytically relate back to what we were debating in teetering me, which was the in Voss. If one goes to paragraph 84 of the Italian case, the present case is therefore clearly distinguishable from the case of Voss in which the court held that a compensation scheme under the Polish German Reconciliation Foundation, former forced labourers which is distinct from the system as set out by the foundation law fell within the ambit of Article 60 convention. In that case, the court found that the applicant met the requirements and therefore enjoyed at least unarguable grounds. A right of compensation subsequently confirmed in the court's judgement as the applicants were clearly excluded from benefits under the foundation. Law and compensation for forced labour was only provided recently by the foundation law. The court considers that the applicants could not claim to have had a right of compensation, even unarguable grounds. It follows an article 61 of the convention does not apply to the facts of the present case. So as I understand it, the distinction was that involves they met the conditions of entitlement. They had a right. Therefore, I can't remember the facts of this sufficiently clearly as to whether it has crystallised into a particular amount.

16	p1,00:54:04.210,00:55:29.580,spk_1,	True	Counsel: because of the similarity private insurance schemes sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of dispute for the determination of civil rights, see Feldbrugge and Deumeland. However, in the Salesi v Italy judgement Article 61 was held by a dispute over entitled to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising the the applicant had an assertive all right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison private insurance schemes and the requirement reform of contract between the individual and the State. In Schuler-Zgraggen, the court held development in the law and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance insurance, including even welfare assistance, then this important passage in paragraph 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the conventions that, the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one of protocol, one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights under Article 6(1). And we would submit, like quite the converse. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation about one of protocol, one which avoids inequalities, treatment based on distinctions, which at the present day, imperial logical or unsustainable.

16	p3,01:41:47.220,01:44:37.450,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The court has already found that the Italian military internees cannot claim to have a legitimate expectation of compensation for the detention and forced labour and the fact that issue therefore do not fall within the ambit of Article 1 Protocol 1. This finding is not contradicted by the court's judgement. In the case of Stack. In that case, the court held non contributory social benefits funded by General taxation fall within the scope of Article 1 Protocol 1. The court decided that although that provision does not grant the right to receive a Social Security payment of any kind, if a state does decide to establish a benefit scheme, it must do so in a matter of compatible with Article 14, subsequently confirmed by the Grand Chamber. However, the present case is distinguishable from the case of Stack for the following reasons. It's true that both the present case and the case of stack concerned non contributory benefits which are partly funded by general taxation. However, while the case of STEC dealt with a supplementary regular payment and a regular retirement pension in the framework of Social Security, the subject of the instant case is a one off grant, one off payment granted as compensation for events which had occurred even before the convention entered into force and represented in a wider sense a settlement of damages caused by the Second World War. The payments were made outside the framework of social security legislation and cannot be likened to the payments in stack. So, my Lord, so far as I'm aware, this is the only post stack case on Article 1 protocol 1 that takes the matter any further forward. But what it makes clear in terms is that Steck was not intended to open the gates on our ambit of Article 1 protocol 1 to any form of state assistance or benefit in whatever form. And in my submission. If the European Court is drawing a distinction between a cash payment made to force labourers in the Second World War and saying, Well, that's outside the confines of STEC, then in my submission it would necessarily follow that a discretion, a scheme with a series of evaluative judgments where the benefit is a benefit in kind would also fall outside. The terms of step is quite right to say there are other issues that arise in the Italian case that don't arise here, and one can say there were a number of factors. One was the fact that the scheme had come into a related to events well before the convention, and the other was that it was a very particular factual situation. But in my submission, it gives the lie to my learned friend Mr [inaudible]'s submission.

Not that somebody decided it was property under Article 1 of Protocol 1, and therefore somebody said, Well, of course, Article 6 must apply.

I'm going to do this quickly because it's in our in my written case and to some degree just pulling together what I've already said. First of all, looking at the subject matter of the decision. This is a case which, at its highest, is on the periphery of being a civil right. Secondly, as was said in Runa Begum, it is a highly policy-driven scheme replete with evaluative judgments. And thirdly, it involves what Lord Hoffman described as a classic exercise of administrative discretion. So those are the factors in subject matter of the decision.
17	p1,00:44:00.090,00:44:25.920,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Well, My Lord, there will be situations which will clearly be on the other side of the line, so that if, for example, one takes part 6 of the Housing Act that we looked at briefly on allocation as indeed the House of Lords held in the [Inaudible] case that does not give right to any individual rights dealing with priorities of allocation, it doesn't give any individual any individual right.
17	p3,02:19:51.610,02:20:46.720,spk_2,	True	Counsel: In my submission, if Article six is engaged here, in other words, if it is a civil right, then it is absolutely on the borderline or on the periphery of what is a civil right, and that gives clear indications of the approach that should be taken to whether or not there's a breach of Article six, in other words, to whether or not there is a requirement for a full fact finding appeal mechanism and your lordships have already seen the references in Begum. If I just refer to the paragraphs Lord Bingham made this point of paragraph five and Lord Hoffman at paragraph 34. And, um, as we've seen a moment ago, my Lord Hope Lady Hale made the same point in Croydon.
17	p3,01:56:15.510,01:59:23.660,spk_2,	False	
17	p3,01:59:43.820,02:06:10.770,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes, my Lord, I'll come well, the boundary point in my submission all flows back to Brian and taking into account those different criteria on breach. And I'll come to that when I come to breach. But yes, in my submission, what Lord Bingham and Hoffman said in Begum about being on the edge and engagement reflecting on Bridge goes back to Brian. And that, in turn, goes back to Mr Bratt's opinion. Brian, uh, just staying on Croydon for a moment. Uh, paragraph 45 of Lady Hale's opinion. Uh, if this is a civil right at all, therefore I'd be inclined to hold that it rests at the periphery of such rights the same point again. And then, my Lord Lord, hold. Yeah. Who, if I may say so with respect was slightly more definite on the point paragraphs 61 62 mhm 61. I read this passage as an endorsement of the points that passage in Rutabagas We've looked at on a number of occasions that Lord Lord Bingham made in Rana Begum that if an elastic interpretation is given to the Article 61 concept of civil rights, flexibility must also be given to the procedural requirements of that article. If over judicial isation of the administrative welfare scheme is to be avoided. But it is important to to recognise that in Sofia is in room to begin the question. If so, at what point administrative welfare schemes fall outside. The scope of Article 61 was not tested. Sofia, as I've said, fell within the mainstream of cases about social security and welfare benefits in room to begin the House preferred not to take a decision on this issue. 62. There are, however, a number of straws in the wind that has been generated by the decisions from Strasbourg since Reena Begum. That suggests that a distinction can now be made between the class of Social Security and welfare benefits that is of a kind exemplified by so lazy and those benefits which are, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgement by the relevant authority. The phrase civil rights is, of course, an autonomous concepts, the wound room. But it does convey the idea of what in stack the Strasbourg court referred to as an assessor to bill right in that paragraph, having declared that the convention must be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its provisions and in Paragraph 49 that it's in the interest of the convention as a whole, that the autonomous concept of possession in a one P one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights, the court said. And I've already read your lordships. That passage then 63 reference to luas. Oh, to a private right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law and to an individual right of which the applicant may consider him the holder himself. The holder are consistent with this approach. So, too, are the references in Manito to a right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law. Where the court added, the dispute must be genuine and serious. It may relate not only to the actual existence of the right to also do its scope and manner of exercise. The outcome. The proceedings must be directly decisive with the writing question cases where the award of benefit is dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and, if so, how the need for it has assessed ought to be met. Do not answer that description. The exact limits of the autonomous concept remain elusive. One can be confident that cases where the relationship between the beneficiary, the public authority, is a public law character, as in one room where the role of the applicant associations in regard to the construction and maintenance of public housing was over. Typically, general interest character fall outside the scope Mr Howell submitted. There's no distinction to be drawn between the forms in which welfare benefits may be provided. But none of the Strasbourg authorities goes that far. And the carefully worded passages from Suazo and Stack, to which I have referred, seemed to me to contradict his proposition. The series of cases about the enforcement of judgments made by the courts about social housing in Russia, to which he referred of which the latest is Nogovitsyn, offer no assistance as the question whether a duty to provide social housing gives rise to a civil right was not argued for these reasons. I think it can now be asserted with reasonable confidence that the duty of the local authority under Section 21 of the 1989 to provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of the factors mentioned in that subsection does not give rise to a civil right within the meaning of Article 61 of the convention. So my lords, in my submission that comes as close as this house caught in its previous guys was has been prepared to come to what is a civil right? Can I then turn to pull those submissions together in respect of the scheme under Part seven, and just point to what, in my submission, are the three critical elements as to why this isn't a civil right? Firstly, the series of highly evaluative judgments along the way to getting the right and I'll go to those in a second. Secondly, the way the right is met or discharged itself involves discretionary judgments. And thirdly, the circumstances in which the right can be lost or the duty can be discharged involves again highly evaluative judgments. Yeah, so I'm going to take this speedily because your Lordships have already looked at the scheme twice. But in terms of that first heading the series of highly judgmental decisions along the way to getting the right section of the act, of course, is that Volume one tabloid?

18	p4,00:44:36.390,00:47:23.290,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Well, my lord, those are the issues that arose in Crompton. And so perhaps to that degree, it's not surprising they didn't make very much of Paragraph 47. But even taking Crompton on its own terms, in my submission, the critical point about 73 which then comes up in 77 is that it was a decision-making structure where there was no need at all for professional expertise and where the decisions that had to be made: what's the amount of your redundancy compensation, were factual decisions rather than judgmental ones, which have effectively turned on adding up what you thought the entitlement was. And when one comes to 77, I won't read through the first part of it again, but you come on the second page about Line five. Accordingly, there was no compelling reason for the decision on the level of compensation to have been made by the Army board rather than by an independent and impartial tribunal. In this respect, therefore, the court considers that circumstances are similar to those in Tsfayo. So what we were looking at was a scheme that didn't require that didn't involve the policy, stroke, expediency, issues that were part and parcel of Bryan and then part and parcel of Begum. So that's the distinction that was being drawn there. And in my submission there's nothing in Crompton that casts any doubt whatsoever on the analysis in Begum. Because of that distinction about the nature of the schemes. Clearly, all that the European court in Crompton thought it was doing was following that part of Tsfayo. And what what is so interesting about Crompton is that if one then goes on to 78 it brings home that again, you have to look at the matter holistically and all those different Bryan elements, because actually there was no breach in Compton because because of the nature of the decision that was being being made and because of the scope of the High Court, in respect of that particular decision, there was no breach. So that's one of the factors that has to be pulled in there.
18	p1,00:08:40.680,00:12:09.660,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord. Certainly, I'm going to come to the question of a practical considerations, which weighed heavily with the Court of Appeal and indeed with the judges in the county court and my Lord the, but in our submission put shortly there is. It is a perfectly workable arrangement, if that is what is needed, that one has certain aspects decided in one way and others in another. My Lord, my sixth. That preliminary point was the well, it's the point that I've made that the about yes, the seventh is that although, and this indeed is the point. Lady Hale has already raised that, although both the Ali and Ibrahim cases involved the issue of whether a particular letter has been received. Of course, cases that turn only on the resolution of fact can arise in other ways. In the homelessness context of which Tomlinson is an example, and my Lords and my Lady, this leaves 2 areas of major controversy. There is a third area of controversy in relation to remedy, whether it must be a declaration of incompatibility or not. But on the substance of the matter. Two major issues first were the council's adverse credibility findings against both appellants and consequent abandonment of the councils housing duties towards the appellant determinations of civil rights of the appellant's for Article six purposes. That is therefore, the determination not only at rights which plainly they are but of civil rights. We submit that they were civil rights that matters, what the Housing Act conferred, and secondly, if so, does Article six require a full merits review. In our submission, It does, in a case which turns on a simple question of primary fact with no specialist expertise required to determine it and no element of policy or discretion involved in the determination. Well, this latter submission well, the former submission involves the determination of a case that was not determined as such in Runa Begum, but was the assumption upon which the house proceeded. The latter submission involves either distinguishing or overruling the decision of the House of Lords in the Runa Begum case on suitability of accommodation. My Lord, another way of putting that submission is that it gives effect to the decision of the Strasbourg court in Tsfayo, in the UK and now also, we would say to the very recent and important decision of the Strasbourg court in Crompton and the UK a decision more recent even than our printed case, my Lord before coming in a moment to the first issue that is determination of civil rights. I should perhaps say a word about the composite expression in Article 6, an independent and impartial tribunal.
18	p4,00:04:46.440,00:07:49.790,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And then my Lord dealing, going on to deal with breach. What I'm going to do is make a few general points but trying not to cover ground covered by Mr Arden. Then I'm going to deal with the Tsfayo and Crompton, Crompton briefly but Tsfayo in a little more detail because Mr Arden didn't do so. And then I'm going to conclude by just making submissions about those Bryan factors and how they apply to this case. So in terms of the general points, as I said, I'll take it quickly. First of all, in my submission, the issues in the present case were decided in Begum. Although Begum concerned a challenge to a finding on suitability of the accommodation offered, the decision was at the House of Lords was quite explicitly not limited to where cases where the issue was one of judgement alone. And the argument being advanced today by my learned friend Mr Goudie was rejected in terms in my submission in Begum and the references are Lord Bingham at paragraph 10 and Lord Hoffman at paragraph 58. So, in my submission, where that leaves us is either can one draw a distinction on the facts of this case and or do Tsfayo and Crompton force this court to depart from the House of Lords decision in Begum. Dealing with the first of those can one somehow draw a distinction on the facts? In my submission, the answers that plainly has to be no. Part seven of the Housing Act decisions are based on a complicated nexus of facts and judgments, and some of what might be called simple facts then lead into difficult judgments. So there might be facts about whether the lifts work regularly in a block. And that's a classically simple question of fact. How often in the last six months of these lifts broken? It may be critical then to the question as to whether the accommodation is suitable for somebody with two small children who has to carry them up the stairs. Those are exactly the kind of issues that do arise in suitability cases, and in my submission, it is completely unrealistic to try to divide up these issues into fact issues and judgement issues. And to go that way in my submission is to invite absolute chaos and I say that with care in my submission that is not too high absolute chaos in the county court, where some poor judge has to try to make these distinctions.
18	p1,01:20:07.110,01:23:43.830,spk_1,	False	Counsel: um, and therefore of its limitations can deal with all these issues, but no further. And no such question in paragraph 8 is this. Equality is this quality rather review sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 61 on the assumption that a civil right is an issue playing that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently credible conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authorities. The question is whether this limitation on the county court judges role deprives him of the jurisdiction necessary. Satisfy the requirements of Article 61 in the present context. In approaching this question, I regard three matters as particularly pertinent. First of all, part 7 is only part of a far reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing administration that scheme very largely entrusted to local housing authorities. While the homelessness provisions are intended to assist those individuals who are or may become homeless, there is a wider public dimension to the problem of homelessness. Secondly, although, as in the present case an authority may have to resolve disputes, factual issues, it's factual findings will only be staging posts on the way too much the much broader judgments which the authority has made in deciding whether it owes the full housing duty to an applicant under Section 1931, the authority has to be satisfied of 3 matters and not satisfied of another. Under 1937(b), the authority ceases to be subject full housing duty if it is satisfied that the accommodation offered to the applicant was suitable for the applicant and that it was reasonable for him to accept it. Thus, it is the authorities judgement which matters, and it is unlikely to be a simple factual decision. Yes, and then Thirdly, there's reference to the review regulations, and over the page of Paragraph 10 was referenced the question of contracting out, whether that be desirable or not, and in paragraph 11 in relation to the requirements of Article 6(1) are supplied to the review by a court that administrative decision made by a body not closed with the independence and impartiality required of Judicial Tribunal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence, as in relation to civil rights, has shown a degree of flexibility in its search for just and workman like submission solutions and then certain recent authorities of particular importance, including Byran and the UK and Kingsley in the UK amongst others. None of these cases is indistinguishable from the present, but taken together, they provide compelling support the conclusion that in a context such as this, the absence of a full fact finding jurisdiction in the tribunal, which appeal lies for an administrative decision making body does not disqualify that tribunal for the purpose of Article 6(1). This is a conclusion which I accept more readily because it gives effect to a procedure laid down by Parliament, which should properly operated, ensure fair treatment that such as Runa Begum Then there is the speech of Lord Hoffmann, and I can perhaps pick that up at paragraph 27 on page 445.

18	p1,01:58:57.580,02:00:41.530,spk_1,	True	Counsel: by quite a margin. So, yes, there's a financial interest. But equally, of course, the authority has a financial interest in not being under the the duty to provide the accommodation to secure the provision of the accommodation, which is necessarily an expensive matter, uh, for the authority. And so the interest exists either way around, my Lord. The issue in Runa Begum on the other hand, was whether the accommodation offered was suitable in our submission. That contrast not only with the situation in Tsfayo, whether it was good cause for delay in making the claim, um, but contrast with the present situation and the Lady Hale raised earlier the question of the various factual issues that might arise under the Housing Act. One of those, of course, is whether there's good cause for making an application out of time for the review procedure. In our submission that's very close to the Tsfayo situation would be extraordinary, say the least, if Tsfayo was not to apply to that sort of issue when it arose in the homelessness context as well as the housing benefit context, our submission that simply reinforces true distinction is between the nature of the decision, a decision under consideration and what was an issue, not the separate scheme, and that in our case, the point is even stronger than would delay. Namely, were letters received the appeals, therefore not merely on the Tsfayo side of the line. Runa Begum side of the line.

In my submission, one has to read the passage in Tsfayo together. What the European court is saying is that if you put these factors together, you get a breach of Article 61. It's not saying each of these factors on their own would necessarily lead to a breach of Article 6. And when, if one just goes to the end of 45, there's consideration of Runa Begum there and in the last sentence, any significant depart from the procedural rules would have afforded a ground of appeal and then the first sentence of 46, the court considers the decision making process in the present case was significantly different and then there are two aspects in which the decision-making process was significantly different. First of all, the aspect in Paragraph 46 which is that the issues raised in Begum and Bryan required professional knowledge of an or expertise, whereas the issues decided by a Housing Benefit review board was a simple question of fact. That was one difference, and then the other difference was in 47. Now my just dealing with 46 first, my learned friend Mr Goudie says, oh, but if there was a breach, Housing Benefit Review boards had all feelings and rights to representation, so if there was a breach there, then that would suggest that the position must be worse under Part 7. But in my submission that does slightly involve taking the perspective of an English lawyer. Strasbourg does not place the same reliance oral hearings as do most of us, probably normally. And what they're saying in 46 and 47 is that Begum had the greater procedural protection precisely because of the impartiality problems that arise on the Housing Benefit Review board. So it's just not like to read 46 47 to suggest that the housing that the European court were thinking well, even though there's all these procedural protections in the Housing Benefit Review board, there's still a problem, ergo under Part seven there would be less of a problem. That isn't the approach the European court have taken at all. And when they talk in 46 about the facts and the good cause being a housing benefit review board deciding a simple question of fact. The contrast there is with the kind of policy decisions which are inherent in the schemes in Bryan and Runa Begum as opposed to the kind of decisions being made under the Housing Benefit Review Board in this particular case, good cause. So Bryan and Begum schemes, replete with policy and judgmental questions and, of course, self evidently, this case is exactly the same as Runa Begum, whereas a Housing Benefit Review board was not a board, not a decision-maker that required any specialist expertise. See the top of page 471. No specialist expertise required to determine this issue, which is under the new system, determined by a non-specialist tribunal. And that's a a factually quite important point about Tsfayo. That, of course, by the time Tsfayo got to the European court effectively paths had been. I was about to say paths has been sold, but the position has been accepted by the UK government because the new housing benefit has been pulled in under the old Social Security Appeal tribunal system. So the anomaly which had existed for years of counsellors deciding housing benefit issues which were exactly the same in many cases as the income support issues, had been swept away. So that's paragraph 46. But it is then important to focus also on paragraph 47. Because 47 is all about impartiality. It's not about independence. The problem was that the European court felt that these counsellors were not impartial. Last sentence of 47. The safeguards built into the housing benefit review procedure were not adequate to overcome this fundamental lack of objective impartiality. Now, whether they were right or wrong in that approach to counsellors isn't really the issue. What matters is that that's what Strasbourg was thinking about and self, evidently by their support for Runa Begum, they did not think that officers of local authorities suffered from the same difficulty. And to some degree, your lordships relationship don't need to grapple with all this today. But in my submission that the approach of the Strasbourg court is not unreasonable on this because contrary to what Mr Goudie said, local authority members and local authority officers are not in the same position. Members are politically accountable, democratically accountable and are associated very closely with the local authority. They are the political limb of the local authority. Whereas employees, we went through this at great length in Croyden, subject to employment contracts. They are neither legally nor in terms of public perception associated with the local authority in the same way that counsellors would be. And they also have their professional expertise to give them the training and the impartiality which might not to be so true

18	p4,00:09:41.740,00:12:40.640,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The local authority Housing Authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him, and the authority notify him, that they regard themselves after having discharged their duty under this section. Now, the first point to make is an obvious one. Unlike Section 20 of the Children Act, the section, subsection 1935 doesn't distinguish between different limbs that might be said, we're not talking about domestic precedent fact here, but that might be said within Article 6 terms, somehow to be discreet questions of fact. You can see that even within section 1935, there are certain things that might be argued by lawyers to be discreet. Have you been informed? Did you get the letter? Have you been informed of the possible consequence of refusal? Now, is that a discreet fact? Or is that a judgement? In other words, that becomes: was the letter good enough? So you got the letter that's not in dispute. But you say that this letter didn't tell me about the possible consequence of refusal. This letter missed the point. So is that a discreet question of fact? And then, very similarly of his right to request a review of the suitability, was that sufficiently clear? And then the next bit is if the applicant refuses an offer of accommodation, well, you can see that that could be analysed as a question of fact. Did your letter back refuse the offer, or was it more equivocal? One can see, in particular cases that might arise, and then which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him. Well, I think everybody would agree that was a judgement call and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged their duty. Well again. That could be: Did you get the letter? But it could also be questions within the letter as to whether it was clear or not. So, my Lord, in my submission, attempts to try to divide off one particular factual, inverted commas, issue only is going to give rise to a domino effect of other potential factual issues that could be argued to be discreet or in a non domestic sense conditions precedent. So in my submission, the statutory scheme, statutory words do not at all support an analysis that there are discrete questions of fact which can be wholly divorced from the rest of the part seven decision.
18	p1,01:10:09.430,01:13:18.070,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Yes. And okay. And my Lord, It is, of course, an important feature of the statutory scheme. Yeah, that someone who is in priority need and not homeless intentionally and who is entitled to accommodation doesn't lose that accommodation because they decline a particular offer of accommodation which they don't regard as being suitable unless it has, in terms been drawn to their attention that they will lose the right. So it is important whether or not a letter of this kind is received. And more generally, part seven of the act relating to duties the homeless and their entitlements is very different from part six relating to the regulation of schemes for the allocation of housing and not giving anyone a right to accommodation. My Lord is it, um, said in this respect, part 7 of the Housing Act is similar to section 20 subsection 1 of the 1989 Children Act. Then I respond. Yes, in many ways it is. And that that assists me in that if who is a child is a question of precedent or jurisdictional fact on the construction of the Children's Act. That one has, of course, to look at the construction in our case of the Housing Act. And what as this court has seen, is in terms of Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. The first gateway question of fact is what the applicant informed of the possible consequences of refusal and the right to review. If so, the second gateway question of fact is, Did the applicant refused the accommodation? And then it's both those facts are established so that one is through the two gateways. Then one has the further question, not a question of fact arising. The Runa Begum question whether the authority are satisfied that the accommodation was suitable. So if and insofar as the authority is relying on Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. And then the suitability issue. If they're relying on Section 193, subsection seven, then that is exclusively a question of fact. And my Lord, What we say is that these gateway questions of fact or exclusive questions of fact are eminently questions for a court, either as precedent questions or subsequent questions upon review for appeal.

18	p2,00:52:50.230,00:54:16.020,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yeah, the first was, that the case is all uniform and summarised it in Bryan to Runa Begum followed Brian, three Runa Begum should not be departed from, there's no basis for it. Four, then while there is of definite -- if that is not sufficient, then of definition there has to be some difference between Runa Begum on the one hand, and Tsfayo and Crompton on the other. Yeah. Which the appellant says, it's all about an issue of pure fact, and Runa Begum wasn't, although when we come to it, we'll see it was described pretty much as factual, parts at any rate. Tsfayo does not say in our submission, any factual issue requires a fact-based view only that in the circumstances of that case, applying Bryan, taking all three points there was such a requirement, and the points of distinction were that the procedure at first below was unsatisfactory, and that is the impartiality issue of the board.
18	p4,00:20:33.560,00:22:54.680,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Well, I think that's why I said Mr. Goudie was very unclear as to what he was saying was a pure question of fact, because on one of his submissions yesterday, he would have accepted that that was a stepping stone on the way to suitability and therefore that would fall outside his pure question of fact. It's not clear to me where he says that the line would be drawn because clearly, have you been attacked, like does the lift work is a question of fact that ultimately can be determined by a jury. It doesn't need professional expertise. It's that kind of question of fact. On the test he posited yesterday about: Is it is it a fact that requires specialist expertise? The answer has to be no. So in my submission, all you get to from Mr. Goudie's submissions on this is it is an extremely untidy line which will has no basis in the statutory scheme whatsoever and which inevitably will just give rise to huge amounts of litigation. Well, if Article 6 forced that, then so be it. But in my submission, Article 6 clearly doesn't force that. And while remaining on this point about what is a question of fact, in my submission, the other aspect of this is to emphasise the scope of Mr. Goudie's argument here. Because if this court was to accept that questions of fact had to be dealt with by a full fact-finding tribunal, then that has implications that goes way, way beyond Part 7 in this case, and it starts to unscramble cases back to Alconbury because, of course, many planning cases and licensing cases, whatever, will involve pure questions of fact. And sometimes they'll involve them as what could be described as conditions precedent. So I just thought of one example over lunch. Listed buildings. Does do the works fall within the curtilage of the listed building? Curt. That's a question of fact. Ultimately, you have to have judgement. But a question of fact Does that then become something that the High Court, on a Section 288 appeal has to consider as a primary facet-finder. One can see there's a huge. 
18	p4,01:02:19.760,01:05:39.420,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Well, it does come down to that in that in this instance, and I'm coming to this shortly, that if one takes the 3, one appreciates it's not an exhaustive list, if one takes the three criteria that is so to speak, highlighted in Bryan. In this case, the subject matter of the decision and the nature of the dispute come very close to one another, namely the issue of whether one expresses it as an issue of fact or an issue of credibility. But here the dispute is about a discreet factual issue. However, one characterises, however, one describes that issue, it is certainly not a dispute in whole or in part about suitability. And as the court has seen many times now Subsection 5 of Section 193 is in two parts. The authority ceases to be under the duty if first the condition is satisfied that the applicant has been informed of the consequences and if so, secondly, the offer that is refused is a suitable accommodation. And in our submission, the question whether the precondition is satisfied, what I earlier described as a gateway, is a discreet question. As Lord Browne has put it, there is a completely independent precondition, a separate parallel inquiry, not a staging post. So in terms of the three.  Court: Can I just be clear? I mean, is that now your case? I mean, are you narrowing it to the receipt of letters now that you've got? Now that Mrs Tomlinson is separately catered to?  Counsel: These are appeals are about the receipt of letters, and one is not therefore concerned specifically to argue the position in relation to intentionality, the issue in Tomlinson. But I accept, as I've always accepted, that are in terms of what are discreet issues of fact under Part seven, that is by no means necessarily confined to the question of receipt of letters. There may be other examples. Just as there are examples in addition to suitability of matters that are evaluative.  Court: What about how often the lifts work is that fact or is that evaluation?  Counsel: Well, that only comes in in the context of evaluation. There's nowhere in the legislation where there is a requirement in relation to lifts working or anything, any conclusion following from a factual finding that lifts don't work, whether or not lifts work simply goes into the consideration of the suitability of the accommodation and that, therefore, it's a classic example of a factual inquiry, which is incidental and ancillary to the determination of the suitability issue and is merely a staging post on the way to the determination of the suitable issue.

18	p2,00:07:54.940,00:10:29.780,spk_0,	True	Counsel: rovide sufficiency of review in a number of cases against the United Kingdom, and they're then mentioned, including the Stefan and Kingsley cases, so one sees that Bryan is explained by reference to specialised area of law and expertise of the inspector in relevant respect in Paragraph 73. However, in Tsfayo, the court reached a different conclusion, concluding that the decision-making process was significantly different from previous cases. Whereas in Bryan, the issue, to be determined required a measure of professional knowledge or experience and the exercise of administrative discretion pursuant to wider policy aims. In Tsfayo, the board was deciding a simple question of fact, namely, whether there was good cause the applicants delay in making a benefit claim. On this question, the applicant have given evidence to the board, at the first she knew that anything was amiss, that her claim was when she received a notice from her housing association landlord to repossess because the rent was in arrears. The board found her explanation to be unconvincing and rejected her claim for back payment of benefit essentially on the basis of their assessment of her credibility. No specialist expertise was required to determine this issue, nor could the factual findings in Tsfayo be said to be merely incidental to the reaching broader judgments of policy or expediency, which it was for the democratically accountable authority to take. Accordingly, the court concluded that judicial review proceedings did not offer, in the circumstances raised in Tsfayo sufficiency of review in light of the fact that the High court had no jurisdiction to re-hear the evidence or substitute its own views as to the applicant's credibility. As a result, the central issue in the dispute was not determined by an independent and impartial tribunal. So one sees there that Tsfayo is characterised as concerning a simple question of fact, based on an assessment of credibility, not requiring specialist expertise and not incidental to the reaching of broader judgments of policy or expediency. And then the court goes on to the application of the general principles to the facts of the case. And one sees at paragraph 77 that the court considers that there is a legitimate concern that the Army board lacked the necessary structural independence.
18	p4,01:05:41.560,01:08:59.190,spk_2,	True	Counsel: and my Lord. So in terms of the three highlighted Bryan criteria, the subject matter of the decision is whether a letter in particular terms has been received, and that is very different from Runa Begum and is actually a fortiori to Tsfayo in terms of being a factual subject matter. The content of the dispute is whether the denial of receipt is credible. That again is very different from Runa Begum and again is afortiori to Tsfayo in terms of being a factual dispute. All that differs between Runa Begum and the present cases on the one hand, and Tsfayo on the other hand, is the manner in which the decision was made. The difference between an officer's decision and a panel of councillors' decision. That difference, however, in our submission is peripheral, both because comparing the two schemes, homelessness and housing benefit, it is not a material difference because homelessness reviews can be by councillors or by officers, and because in terms of independence and impartiality, there's not much difference between officers and councillors. Councillors, as my learned friend, Mr Arden acknowledged, are subject to codes of conduct which govern their conduct generally, not only their conduct in the one respect he highlighted for his purposes their conduct towards officers, but also and more importantly, their conduct towards the recipients of the council services. Like officers, councillors do not have a personal financial interest in the outcome. Like officers, they have an interest in their authorities, finances and resources, so one shouldn't over-denigrate councillors and their democratic accountability as a reason for not interfering with their decisions. Not, the contrary, as Alconbury and other cases demonstrate. And nor, on the other hand, should one over-praise officers. They are, of course, at one with counsillors in properly seeking to help the homeless. They are, of course, at one with counsillors in properly seeking not to prejudice unduly, more than necessarily, those who are on the authorities housing waiting lists. But officers may as readily as counsellors, get the balance wrong. From time to time, authorities not excluding Birmingham, are criticised for failure on the part of its officers to treat the homeless fairly. So officer decisions are neither inherently nor in practice, markedly superior as a class to councillor decisions as a class, this is not a distinction that one should make too much of. And in our submission, the manner of decision, therefore, is a minor difference between our case and Tsfayo. And given Crompton is not to be regarded as being a major feature of Tsfayo.

19	p4,00:49:11.770,00:52:08.210,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Then you look at the nature of the issues that arise and the issues that arise under this scheme are those that in general require professional judgement and expertise. Looking at the scheme as a whole, it is not a scheme where there are simple questions of fact that lead to the end conclusion, like Minnetto or Tsfayo. And yes, there may be factual disputes in there. But that's part of the decision-making process, which requires the professional judgments. And then you look at the content of the dispute itself here. The alleged breach of Article six is that the reviewing officer is not independent. That is exactly the same as the argument in Runa Begum. It is in contrast to the argument in Tsfayo, but also to put it in the context of the case law. It's in contrast with a case like Wright where the court may remember that in Wright, the alleged breach of Article six or well the found breach of Article six was a complete denial of any right to make representations. So you, and the consequence of that decision, was that the person usually less lost their job, not always but on the fact that was very often going to be the result. So you've got a major departure from the principles of a fair trial, fair hearing combined with the very draconian consequence. Whereas here, you've got structural ind, lack of independence. But in terms of that breach and the consequences of that breach, nobody suggested the consequences aren't serious, but they're not in article six terms, the same as losing your job. Because of the. I'm sorry, I should explain that I'm getting into shorthand at this stage. Because that is such a clear attack on your private law rights. The consequence in Wright. You have a private contract of employment and that had to be terminated by statutory process if you were put on the provisional list. So that is an absolutely classic central civil right that has just been interfered with. Whereas here, we are on the absolute edge of a Part 7 right and whether they are Article six rights at all. 
19	p1,01:35:56.960,01:36:38.100,spk_1,	False	Counsel: We rely on that, of course, and say there's no reason why the general provisions shouldn't apply in this particular case. And one sees that general proposition is supported in footnote 16 by reference to Salesi and Mennitto v Italy, and Schuler-Zgraggen and Switzerland and paragraph 40 continues. The court agrees with the parties the applicants claim for housing benefit concerned the determination of the civil rights from the Article 6(1) applied. So although that wasn't an issue, the court did express its agreement as that the applicants, therefore, had a right to a fair hearing before an independent part of funeral.

19	p1,01:14:17.210,01:17:46.550,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The manner in which the decision was arrived at and the content of the dispute, as the Strasbourg court has made clear. In Bryan and other cases, my Lord fundamental for present purposes is the materiality of the distinction between on the one hand an administrative decision, which require the exercise by experts as a policy, banks discretion, not the present cases and on the other hand, decisions which as here turn on issues of simple primary fact and no more in the former category. Of course, judicial review or appeal on law only as that concept is conventionally understood will suffice. But not in the latter category. And my Lord we submit that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum comes within the former category, concerned as it was with suitability of accommodation. My Lord, Runa Begum is in volume 4 of the authorities a tab 20. The decision and early 2003. Okay. Yes, my Lord's first at page 438 of the appeal cases report for Runa Begum, paragraph to the parties were agreed that the appeal raised 3 questions which they express in this way was the review officer's decision on protection to to a determination of civil rights within the meaning of Article 61. If so, did she constitute an independent, impartial tribunal for the purposes of that article? If not, the county court on appeal under section 204 possess full jurisdiction so as to guarantee compliance with Article 6(1). And the second of these questions is answered in paragraph three, not independent. That's an integral feature of the scheme. Paragraph 4, one other question inherent in the first question also lends itself to a summary answer. Whether for the purposes of domestic law, Runa Begum enjoyed anything properly recognised as a right, the authorities suggested. No I cannot accept this. Section 1932 imposed a duty on the authority to secure that accommodation was available for her occupation. This was a duty owed to an enforceable by her, related to a matter of acute concern to her, although Section 26 permitted the authority to performance duty in one of several ways. And although performance calls for the exercise of judgement by the authorities, I think it plain that the authorities duty gave rise to a pluralative in Runa Begum , even though this was not a private law rights enforceable by injunction and damages. The first question differently expressed is whether Runa Begum's right recognised in domestic law, also a civil rights in the autonomous meaning given to that expression for purposes of one of the convention.
19	p2,00:51:31.930,00:52:26.870,spk_2,	True	Counsel: It's not being suggested that this is a new approach that's evolved to question the fact in the way that Lord Hoffmann analysed, for example, the encroachment of Article 8(6) into issues of administrative discretion, in Runa Begum. It's not suggested in either of those cases that Runa Begum failed to apply Bryan, to the contrary, Tsfayo expressly says that Bryan was applied, therefore, does not seem to us that either case affords any basis from departing from or reconsidering Runa Begum. And to a certain extent, that's the precedent issue, although when I come to it, I should deal with it very shortly indeed, because the principles all too well known.
19	p1,01:20:07.110,01:23:43.830,spk_1,	True	Counsel: therefore of its limitations can deal with all these issues, but no further. And no such question in paragraph 8 is this. Equality is this quality rather review sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 61 on the assumption that a civil right is an issue playing that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently credible conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authorities. The question is whether this limitation on the county court judges role deprives him of the jurisdiction necessary. Satisfy the requirements of Article 61 in the present context. In approaching this question, I regard three matters as particularly pertinent. First of all, part 7 is only part of a far reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing administration that scheme very largely entrusted to local housing authorities. While the homelessness provisions are intended to assist those individuals who are or may become homeless, there is a wider public dimension to the problem of homelessness. Secondly, although, as in the present case an authority may have to resolve disputes, factual issues, it's factual findings will only be staging posts on the way too much the much broader judgments which the authority has made in deciding whether it owes the full housing duty to an applicant under Section 1931, the authority has to be satisfied of 3 matters and not satisfied of another. Under 1937(b), the authority ceases to be subject full housing duty if it is satisfied that the accommodation offered to the applicant was suitable for the applicant and that it was reasonable for him to accept it. Thus, it is the authorities judgement which matters, and it is unlikely to be a simple factual decision. Yes, and then Thirdly, there's reference to the review regulations, and over the page of Paragraph 10 was referenced the question of contracting out, whether that be desirable or not, and in paragraph 11 in relation to the requirements of Article 6(1) are supplied to the review by a court that administrative decision made by a body not closed with the independence and impartiality required of Judicial Tribunal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence, as in relation to civil rights, has shown a degree of flexibility in its search for just and workman like submission solutions and then certain recent authorities of particular importance, including Byran and the UK and Kingsley in the UK amongst others. None of these cases is indistinguishable from the present, but taken together, they provide compelling support the conclusion that in a context such as this, the absence of a full fact finding jurisdiction in the tribunal, which appeal lies for an administrative decision making body does not disqualify that tribunal for the purpose of Article 6(1). This is a conclusion which I accept more readily because it gives effect to a procedure laid down by Parliament, which should properly operated, ensure fair treatment that such as Runa Begum Then there is the speech of Lord Hoffmann, and I can perhaps pick that up at paragraph 27 on page 445.

And this is a case in which the court concluded that an application for judicial review by the individual concerned did have sufficiency of review to remedy the lack of independence this is the reasoning by which the court came to that conclusion, in that particular case, that is instructive. And there's certainly that there are no suggestion in Crompton, that a key feature about Tsfayo is the council having been a judge in its own cause or the position of the decision having been made by members rather than officers. What one sees is that Tsfayo is again and again treated as being of wider importance in its particular factual context. Paragraph 50 on page seven of the decision, under the heading D towards the bottom of the page, the scope of judicial review of administrative decision making. The court observes that the scope of judicial review in administrative decision making in the United Kingdom is set out in the court judgement in Tsfayo. Then, turning to the law and halfway down page 8, the applicability of Article six of the proceedings, the government accepted that the African civil rights were determined in the domestic proceedings and Article six was applicable. So this is an authority on the sufficiency of review element, and the court's assessment is from towards the bottom of page 11, that will be the court's assessment and then roman one general principles. Beginning with paragraph 40 The court recalls that even where an adjudicatory body, determining disputes over civil rights and obligations does not comply with Article 6(1) in some respect, no violation of the convention can be found if the proceedings before that body are subject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and does provide the guarantees of Article 6(1). So the question is always whether there is or is not full jurisdiction. Paragraph 71, the court has previously held that in order to determine whether the Article six compliant second tier tribunal had full jurisdiction or provided sufficiency of review to remedy a lack of independence, of first instance, it was necessary to have regard to such factors as the subject matter of the decision appealed against, the manner in which that decision was arrived at and the contents of the dispute, including the desired and actual ground of appeal. See Bryan and Tsfayo. In Bryan, the court found it reasonable that the jurisdiction of the High Court to review findings of fact made at first instance, be limited to considering whether the findings of facts or the inferences based on them were perverse or unreasonable. It reached that conclusion in light of the specialised area of law, an issue in the dispute and the expertise of the inspector in establishing the facts and exercising discretion on a wide range of policy matters accordingly, judicial review in that case offered sufficiency of review and the proceedings, complied with Article 6(1).

That case explains more clearly any earlier case, the interrelation between the concepts, civil rights and the requirement of independent and impartial tribunal. The narrower the interpretation is given civil rights, the greater the need to insist on review by judicial tribunal exercising full powers. Conversely, the more elastic the interpretation is given, the more flexible must be the approach. The requirement very judicialisation of welfare schemes is to be avoided. What the house did in that case was to assume that deciding that Rina Begum's domestic right was also a civil right and made that assumption to hold that the absence for full fact finding and jurisdiction did not disqualify. And paragraph 61 of that opinion.

20	p3,01:36:47.860,01:38:57.850,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Article 6 purposes and at paragraphs 47 48. In the admissibility decision, the court dealt with this matter 47. The convention must also be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions. It is noteworthy in this respect that in its case law on the applicability of Article 61, the court originally held that claims only wealth claims regarding only welfare benefits which form part of a contributory schemes, were because of the similarity to private insurance schemes sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of disputes for the determination of civil rights. Seefeld Burger, However, in so lazy article 61 was held also to apply to a dispute over entitlement to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising that the applicant had an assessor to bill, right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison with private insurance schemes and the requirements for a form of contract between the individual and the state and then his reference to Shoeless Kragen and then 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the convention as a whole that the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one protocol one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of peculiar rights. Under Article 61. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation of Article one protocol, one which avoids inequalities of treatment based on distinctions which in the present day appear illogical or unsustainable. So that's where the courts saying the two articles should go hand in hand. And then my learned friend Mr Gowdy goes from there to suggest well, Article 1 Protocol 1 would support his analysis that benefits in kind, such as those under Part 7 fall within Article 1, Protocol 1, and for that purpose I want I've brought an additional authority, which should be on your Lordships desk called well, it starts associates.
20	p1,01:23:56.180,01:25:48.150,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Yeah, just refer briefly, if I may, to 27 but that's really on the point of Independent tribunal. So it is paragraph 28. I returned to the other two issue in dispute, and then refers to how they may relate to each other, referring to a dissenting opinion in Feldbrugge. Then in paragraph 29, the Strasbourg court has been left to develop the law. It's done so in two ways. First, it's been concerned to ensure that State parties do not exploit the gap left in Article 6 by changing their laws so as to convert a question which would ordinarily be regarded as appropriate. The civil adjudication into an administrative decision outside the reach of the article has done this by treating civil rights and obligations as an autonomous concept not dependent upon the domestic law, classification, right or obligation, which the citizens should have access to a court to determine, referring to Goudie in paragraph 30. The second development has been the doctrine, starting with Ringeisen in Austria in 1971 by which the Strasbourg court has extended Article 6 to cover a wide range of administrative decision making on the ground that the decision determines or decisively affects rights or obligations in private law. In a reference to Alconbury and then more recently, the scope of Article 6 has also been extended to public law rights, such as entitlement to Social Security or Welfare Benefit, and the publicly funded statutory schemes on the ground that they closely resemble writes in private law, referring to Salesi v Italy.

Speech Lord, in our submission, those are important passages. Yeah, then my Lord, that paragraph 73 Your Lordship agrees with my Lord being a man Lord Hoffmann and then from paragraph 74, Lord Millett, deals, with the issue, whether Article 61 is engaged. Yeah, and particularly draw attention to from paragraph 87, through to paragraph 93.
20	p1,01:07:21.180,01:09:13.480,spk_1,	True	And then a paragraph 75 on page 214(3). okay, deals with the timing of the Ringeisen case and the Human Rights Act. And then just between F and G, this case would involve interpreting the words point of law arising from the decision. Or, as the case may be, the original decision. That is the words in Section 204 of the Housing Act to include the question whether the decision making process as a whole, complies with article six in the particular circumstances of the case, this seems to me to be plainly a point of law. The court reaches the conclusion. The process will only comply with Article 6 if the court reaches its own conclusion on disputed questions of fact, and it can indeed must give effect to its disposal powers. Under Section 204(3). It's procedural powers under the civil procedure rules so as to make good the deficiency. And then this is taken further paragraph 80. I therefore see the two possibilities as cumulative rather than alternative. I'm prepared to accept that the local authority may choose to contract out some or all of its reviews to a body whose constitution and procedures enabled the decision to comply with Article 6. But if they do not do so and the particular issues in the case require an independent decision, then the court should fill the gap again. We respectfully adopt that. In fact, on the issue of whether the review procedure can be contracted out, which the House of Lords in Runa Begum was rather inclined to think might not be possible. The Court of Appeal has since held with the candidate.

20	p3,01:02:22.500,01:05:16.650,spk_2,	True	Counsel: This is a highly discretionary scheme. If you go to the top of page 456 in paragraph 67 the whole scheme is shot through with discretions, in which either the council's duty is dependent upon being satisfied of some state of affairs or can be discharged in various ways of its own choosing. By contrast, in Manito, the court said that the management committee of the local Public Health Service, after verifying that the applicant satisfied the conditions for entitlement to the allowance, should simply have made an arithmetical calculation of the quantum. So the discretionary elements in Part 7 were, in Lord Hoffman's view, extremely important. And it it's important to recognise the discretionary elements on a whole series of the stages in the Part seven decision making process. And then, in 69 between, uh, in about the sixth Line, he makes the same point as Lord Bingham that to accept this case, a part 7 claim, as being a civil right would be to go further than Strasburg has gone. And then he's in 70. He says he's not going to decide it. Then, looking briefly at the other members of the Judicial Committee, My Lord, Lord Hope Page 73 agreed with Lord Bingham and Lord Lord Hoffmann. Lord Millett also addressed civil rights in some detail, and the key concluding paragraphs are 90 onwards, where he deals with Silesia, Silesian Minuto, Felder Burger and 91. He says the present case undoubtedly goes further. Still, it has four features which take it beyond the existing law. It's benefiting kind. It involves priority between competing claimants for a finite amount of housing stock. Three. The Housing Authority has a discretion as to the manner in which it discharges its duty. And four ultimately, the question for determination calls for an exercise of judgement. And they're 92 he analyses those. And then, at the end, he says, Rana Begum cannot be said to be claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. He then, to be fair, says in 94. But he's persuaded by these considerations are extending the scope of Article 61 is a desirable end, but needs to go hand in hand with moderating the requirements in the interests of administration, where administrative decisions are involved and then says in the unsettled light of the case law, content to assume without deciding civil right.

21	p1,01:17:52.940,01:20:01.620,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Thus far, I support what the decision says, the reasons that are there given. But then, on the question of civil rights from paragraph five onwards where reference is made to Alconbury, Lord Bingham states at paragraph 6, the European courts approach to rights deriving from social welfare schemes has been complicated by differences of legal tradition in various Member States. As Lord Hoffman explained in Alconbury comparison Feldbrugge in the Netherlands and Deumeland in Germany in the 1986 with Salesi and Italy, and Mennitto and Italy shows movement from a narrower towards a broader interpretation of civil rights. Further cases made no doubt continue that trend to hold that the right enjoyed by Runa Begum, is a civil right for purposes of Article 6 would, however, to be go further than the Strasbourg court has yet gone. And I'm satisfied that in the light of a compelling argument on this point by Mr Salesi, the Secretary of State, that the decision of this court would not many means necessarily be favourable to Runa Begum so I prefer to assume without deciding that Runa Begum's domestic law right is also a civil right and to consider whether on that assumption. But having regard to the nature of the right. The statutory provisions of an appeal to the county court on a point of law satisfies the requirements. Article 6 although the county court jurisdictions appellate's substance the same as that of the high Court in judicial review. Thus the court may not only quashed the authority's decision under 243, it's held to be officiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith, but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable, or if the decision maker is shown to have misunderstood or been ignorant of an established, in relevant fact,

21	p3,01:14:02.030,01:15:48.460,spk_2,	True	I think, to go off precisely relevant point to the case, my lady. My understanding is that under the old Soviet system that were very precise per metre allocations, depending on various criteria. Paragraph 40 alleged violation of Article 61 of the convention The court reiterates that Article 61 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to the civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way, it embodies the right to report of which the right of access that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters constitutes one aspect. However, that right would be illusory. If a contracting states domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party, it would be inconceivable that Article 61 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions to construe. Article 6 is being concerned exclusively. The access to a court and conduct of proceedings will be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law, which the contracting states undertook to respect when they ratified the convention. Execution of a judgement given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the trial for the purposes of Article 6 of Hornsby. So, my Lord, in my submission, that's the ratio of this case, and that is the pattern of all the subsequent cases. They focus on the non enforceability of the court orders in question. In each case, there is no reference to field of rigour line of cases.
21	p1,00:08:40.680,00:12:09.660,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord. Certainly, I'm going to come to the question of a practical considerations, which weighed heavily with the Court of Appeal and indeed with the judges in the county court and my Lord the, but in our submission put shortly there is. It is a perfectly workable arrangement, if that is what is needed, that one has certain aspects decided in one way and others in another. My Lord, my sixth. That preliminary point was the well, it's the point that I've made that the about yes, the seventh is that although, and this indeed is the point. Lady Hale has already raised that, although both the Ali and Ibrahim cases involved the issue of whether a particular letter has been received. Of course, cases that turn only on the resolution of fact can arise in other ways. In the homelessness context of which Tomlinson is an example, and my Lords and my Lady, this leaves 2 areas of major controversy. There is a third area of controversy in relation to remedy, whether it must be a declaration of incompatibility or not. But on the substance of the matter. Two major issues first were the council's adverse credibility findings against both appellants and consequent abandonment of the councils housing duties towards the appellant determinations of civil rights of the appellant's for Article six purposes. That is therefore, the determination not only at rights which plainly they are but of civil rights. We submit that they were civil rights that matters, what the Housing Act conferred, and secondly, if so, does Article six require a full merits review. In our submission, It does, in a case which turns on a simple question of primary fact with no specialist expertise required to determine it and no element of policy or discretion involved in the determination. Well, this latter submission well, the former submission involves the determination of a case that was not determined as such in Runa Begum, but was the assumption upon which the house proceeded. The latter submission involves either distinguishing or overruling the decision of the House of Lords in the Runa Begum case on suitability of accommodation. My Lord, another way of putting that submission is that it gives effect to the decision of the Strasbourg court in Tsfayo, in the UK and now also, we would say to the very recent and important decision of the Strasbourg court in Crompton and the UK a decision more recent even than our printed case, my Lord before coming in a moment to the first issue that is determination of civil rights. I should perhaps say a word about the composite expression in Article 6, an independent and impartial tribunal. Yes,

21	p3,00:44:52.090,00:51:52.700,spk_2,	True	eah, my lord. My lady. As your lordship’s know I am going to deal in its entirety with the first issue. Whether it's a civil right, I'm only going to deal with the second issue to the degree to make some supplementary comments, supplementary submissions to my friend Mr Arden's submissions. And then I will deal briefly with the matter of remedy. Where Mr Arden and I disagree, so far as the issue of Is this a civil right is concerned. Just so your lordships relationship know where I'm going. I'm going to deal first fairly quickly with the Strasbourg case law before Begum quickly because it's summarised in considerable depth in Begum. Then I will touch on Begum in relation to the civil rights issue. Then I will deal with the post Begum Strasbourg cases, then the Croydon case and lastly apply the tests to Part 7 of the Housing Act. Um, now in terms of the case law, up to Begum in respect of civil rights. First of all, it's important just to make clear there is no issue here that the claimants had some form of right, um, that's not disputed, and therefore the only question is whether it is a civil right within the meaning of Article 6. And it is, as your lordships will know very well clearly established that a civil right for the purposes of Article 6 is an autonomous concept. In other words, the way that it's described in domestic law is not determinative of whether it's a civil right or not, and again, to state what is certainly well known to my Lady Hale and my Lord I Hope from the Croydon case, Article 6 has extended into what English lawyers would consider two areas extended into what we would call public law in two ways. First of all, there are a series of cases about public law determinations which impact on private law rights, of which the classic examples are licencing. Decisions such as Kingsley planning decisions such as Brian and decisions relating to employment rights such as Albert and Lake Cont and into that category also now falls the case of Crompton, which relates to private law employment rights, albeit with a slight complication that it was a territorial army case. That line of cases in terms of is it a civil right is not what is an issue today. It's the second line of cases where there is a determination of a claim for a Social Security benefit, which is being suggested by my learned friends, has extended into Part 7 of the Housing Act and at that line of cases, really starts with the decision of the European court in a case called Felder Broker, which is in Volume 6 at tab 40. Uh huh and, yeah, Felda Brugger was a case concerning Dutch Social Security benefits, which were contributory benefits. In other words, the claimant had made payments under the equivalent of our national insurance scheme and whether her claim for the benefits fell within the term civil rights for Article 6 and I'll take your lordships in a moment to the key paragraphs. But the point of Felda Burger was that the European Court found that when it was a contributory benefits, it was directly analogous with a private insurance scheme benefit and therefore, in the same way that a private insurance scheme would give you the right to a would give a civil right and therefore Article 6 rights. If it was a contributory scheme, the same analysis must apply, and that's where one gets to Infeld a burger at paragraphs. Key part starts at page 8, paragraph 32. The European Court looks at the features of public law and says in 32 the first such factors as the character of the legislation. The legal rules governing Social Security benefits in the context of health insurance differ in many respects from the rules which apply to insurance in general, which are part of civil war civil law. The Netherlands state has assumed the responsibility of regulating the framework of the health health insurance scheme and overseeing the operation of that scheme. To this end, it specifies the categories of beneficiaries, defines the limits of the protection afforded, lays down the rates of the contributions and the allowances, et cetera, and that last sentence is important because it's picked up later in terms of the need for precise and clear rules. If one is to have an Article 6 civil right, then Paragraph 33 a second factor of relevance is the obligation to be insured against illness or, more precisely, the fact of being covered by insurance in the event of fulfilling the conditions laid down by the legislation. In other words, those concerned can either opt out of the benefits nor avoid having to pay the relevant contributions. And then, in 37 onwards, the court points to the private law features of the right and first of all, the personal and economic nature of the asserted right, a phrase which comes up again and again in the case law to begin with Paragraph 37. Mrs Feldberg was not affected in her relation with the public authorities as such acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, but in her personal capacity as a private individual, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming a right flowing from the specific rules laid down by the legislation in force. For the individual averting it such a right is often a crucial importance. This is especially so in the case of health insurance benefits, when the employee who is unable to work by reason of illness enjoys no other source of income. In short, the right in question was a personal, economic and individual right factor that brought it close to the civil sphere. And they go on in 38 to talk about the relationship with the employment contract, thus tying it in at that stage into private law rights.

The concept extended. But with that extension has gone some modification of what article 6 requires and at 44 to 45. Reluctant to accept, Article 6 requires the judicialization of claims to welfare services of this kind. Unlike the arguments based on statutory construction and jurisdictional fact, Mr Howell's argument cannot sensibly distinguish between determination of age and other criteria. Every decision about the provision of welfare services has resource implications for public authority. Public authorities exist to serve the public by reducing, raising and spending public money the officers make. The decisions cannot be regarded as impartial, and the problem cannot be cured by the ordinary processes of judicial review. Based upon the usual criteria of legality, fairness, reasonableness or rationality, tribunals will have to be set up to determine the merits of claims to children’s services and so on. Many more resources we might have spent on the services will be diverted. Conclusion, if not difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with Rina Begum.

I returned to the other two issue in dispute, and then refers to how they may relate to each other, referring to a dissenting opinion in Feldbrugge. Then in paragraph 29, the Strasbourg court has been left to develop the law. It's done so in two ways. First, it's been concerned to ensure that State parties do not exploit the gap left in Article 6 by changing their laws so as to convert a question which would ordinarily be regarded as appropriate.

21	p1,00:54:04.210,00:55:29.580,spk_1,	True	Counsel: were because of the similarity private insurance schemes sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of dispute for the determination of civil rights, see Feldbrugge and Deumeland. However, in the Salesi v Italy judgement Article 61 was held by a dispute over entitled to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising the the applicant had an assertive all right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison private insurance schemes and the requirement reform of contract between the individual and the State. In Schuler-Zgraggen, the court held development in the law and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance insurance, including even welfare assistance, then this important passage in paragraph 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the conventions that, the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one of protocol, one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights under Article 6(1). And we would submit, like quite the converse. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation about one of protocol, one which avoids inequalities, treatment based on distinctions, which at the present day, imperial logical or unsustainable.
21	p3,00:55:39.340,00:57:09.460,spk_2,	True	Counsel: as in the two cases previously referred to, other considerations argue in favour of the applicability of Article 61. In the instant case, the most important of these lies in the fact that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, Mrs Salahi was not affected and her relations with the administrative authorities as such. Acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute giving effect to the Constitution. Um, so that's where the law has got to on Social Security benefits, My lords, your lordships, no minuto Is that volume 7 tab 48 but I don't think it's necessary to go to that effectively repeats the Celozzi tasks. And in my submission, what comes out of those tests? Those case law up to that stage is that in order to fall within Article 61, it needs to be an economic and individual right. It needs to be a right flowing from specific rules, and it needs to be a right arising from a scheme where there is no discretion in the method of meeting the right. So just to counter submission, that was certainly made strongly in Croydon. The issue is not whether the right is something that is important to somebody. It might be very important, but that doesn't make it a civil right.
21	p3,01:16:08.580,01:16:53.160,spk_2,	False	Well, my lord, I'm afraid I can't answer that question. That appears to be the way the European court has approached it in these cases. But they don't say that that will always be the case. And they simply don't address the issue of the circumstances in which enforceability of a court or non enforcement of the court order might give rise to articles. Might not, I think, better to say give rise to Article 6 cases. So take the classic example where we know Article six civil rights don't apply Saracini and Tax European Court said, In terms of tax does not, tax disputes do not give rise to a civil right.

21	p3,02:13:30.150,02:14:54.160,spk_2,	False	Counsel: my lord, I'll check that over lunch and come back because I don't want to speculate and get it wrong. So, my lords, in my submission, for all those reasons we see a scheme under part seven, which is, although the duty itself is not subject to the discretion and as much as once you have the right section 1935 puts a duty on the local authority not a power. But whether you get the right precisely, the forms of the right, and how you lose the right to highly judgmental, starkly contrasted with anything that the European Court has found falls within Article 61 and then finally on engagement. My Lord, My Lords, I do want to stress the point that was made very strongly in Croydon. If Article 61 is engaged by a claim under Part seven, then it is very difficult to see why it would not also be engaged by a series of other local authority decisions in the area of welfare. And the most obvious ones are those under the National Assistance Act.
21	p3,01:59:43.820,02:06:10.770,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Yes, my Lord, I'll come well, the boundary point in my submission all flows back to Brian and taking into account those different criteria on breach. And I'll come to that when I come to breach. But yes, in my submission, what Lord Bingham and Hoffman said in Begum about being on the edge and engagement reflecting on Bridge goes back to Brian. And that, in turn, goes back to Mr Bratt's opinion. Brian, uh, just staying on Croydon for a moment. Uh, paragraph 45 of Lady Hale's opinion. Uh, if this is a civil right at all, therefore I'd be inclined to hold that it rests at the periphery of such rights the same point again. And then, my Lord Lord, hold. Yeah. Who, if I may say so with respect was slightly more definite on the point paragraphs 61 62 mhm 61. I read this passage as an endorsement of the points that passage in Rutabagas We've looked at on a number of occasions that Lord Lord Bingham made in Rana Begum that if an elastic interpretation is given to the Article 61 concept of civil rights, flexibility must also be given to the procedural requirements of that article. If over judicial isation of the administrative welfare scheme is to be avoided. But it is important to to recognise that in Sofia is in room to begin the question. If so, at what point administrative welfare schemes fall outside. The scope of Article 61 was not tested. Sofia, as I've said, fell within the mainstream of cases about social security and welfare benefits in room to begin the House preferred not to take a decision on this issue. 62. There are, however, a number of straws in the wind that has been generated by the decisions from Strasbourg since Reena Begum. That suggests that a distinction can now be made between the class of Social Security and welfare benefits that is of a kind exemplified by so lazy and those benefits which are, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgement by the relevant authority. The phrase civil rights is, of course, an autonomous concepts, the wound room. But it does convey the idea of what in stack the Strasbourg court referred to as an assessor to bill right in that paragraph, having declared that the convention must be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its provisions and in Paragraph 49 that it's in the interest of the convention as a whole, that the autonomous concept of possession in a one P one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights, the court said. And I've already read your lordships. That passage then 63 reference to luas. Oh, to a private right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law and to an individual right of which the applicant may consider him the holder himself. The holder are consistent with this approach. So, too, are the references in Manito to a right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law. Where the court added, the dispute must be genuine and serious. It may relate not only to the actual existence of the right to also do its scope and manner of exercise. The outcome. The proceedings must be directly decisive with the writing question cases where the award of benefit is dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and, if so, how the need for it has assessed ought to be met. Do not answer that description. The exact limits of the autonomous concept remain elusive. One can be confident that cases where the relationship between the beneficiary, the public authority, is a public law character, as in one room where the role of the applicant associations in regard to the construction and maintenance of public housing was over. Typically, general interest character fall outside the scope Mr Howell submitted. There's no distinction to be drawn between the forms in which welfare benefits may be provided. But none of the Strasbourg authorities goes that far. And the carefully worded passages from Suazo and Stack, to which I have referred, seemed to me to contradict his proposition. The series of cases about the enforcement of judgments made by the courts about social housing in Russia, to which he referred of which the latest is Nogovitsyn, offer no assistance as the question whether a duty to provide social housing gives rise to a civil right was not argued for these reasons. I think it can now be asserted with reasonable confidence that the duty of the local authority under Section 21 of the 1989 to provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of the factors mentioned in that subsection does not give rise to a civil right within the meaning of Article 61 of the convention. So my lords, in my submission that comes as close as this house caught in its previous guys was has been prepared to come to what is a civil right? Can I then turn to pull those submissions together in respect of the scheme under Part seven, and just point to what, in my submission, are the three critical elements as to why this isn't a civil right? Firstly, the series of highly evaluative judgments along the way to getting the right and I'll go to those in a second. Secondly, the way the right is met or discharged itself involves discretionary judgments. And thirdly, the circumstances in which the right can be lost or the duty can be discharged involves again highly evaluative judgments. Yeah, so I'm going to take this speedily because your Lordships have already looked at the scheme twice. But in terms of that first heading the series of highly judgmental decisions along the way to getting the right section of the act.

But the proposition that, the social welfare schemes are not excluded on account of there being a public nature in our submission as well established and indeed has been established by Strasbourg authorities going back to Feldbrugge and Deumeland in the mid eighties and clearly stated, for example, in Schuler-Zgraggen and Switzerland more recently and indeed, as we shall see in Tsfayo itself. So it's no longer therefore controversial that the concept of the determination of a civil right extends too many questions arising in public law.

Under the heading b, the court assessment, and the very first sentence of Paragraph 40, the court recalls that disputes over entitlements to social security and welfare benefits generally fall within the scope of Article 6(1), with a footnote reference to the earlier cases. And again, that's significant for two purposes. One is because it is describing the general rule and secondly, because it is describing the general rule in terms not only of where at one time one may have started, namely social security, but also welfare benefits. So the law has developed. It may have started with only with contributory social security benefits, then extended to non-contributory benefits, but it's not confined to social security. It extends two in the language of Schuler, describing welfare assistance in the language of Tsfayo welfare benefits. And surely the homelessness scheme, beyond any doubt, is a scheme of welfare benefit or welfare assistance, and therefore, in terms of the applicability, Article 6(1) comes within what is expressed as being the general rule.

22	p1,00:54:04.210,00:55:29.580,spk_1,	True	Counsel: They were, because of the similarity private insurance schemes sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of dispute for the determination of civil rights, see Feldbrugge and Deumeland. However, in the Salesi v Italy judgement Article 61 was held by a dispute over entitled to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising the the applicant had an assertive all right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison private insurance schemes and the requirement reform of contract between the individual and the State. In Schuler-Zgraggen, the court held development in the law and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance insurance, including even welfare assistance, then this important passage in paragraph 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the conventions that, the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one of protocol, one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights under Article 6(1). And we would submit, like quite the converse. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation about one of protocol, one which avoids inequalities, treatment based on distinctions, which at the present day, imperial logical or unsustainable.

22	p3,00:51:53.270,00:52:32.750,spk_2,	True	Counsel: At 39 onwards, the court highlights the affinities with insurance under the ordinary law. Finally, paragraph 39. Finally, the Netherlands health insurance is similar in several respects to insurance under the ordinary law and then the third paragraph of 39. Such differences may exist between private sector insurance and social security, and private sector insurance and social security insurance do not affect the essential character of the link between the insured and the insurer. So stage one in Felder Brugger is contributory benefit directly analogous with insurance rights and therefore a civil right.

I returned to the other two issue in dispute, and then refers to how they may relate to each other, referring to a dissenting opinion in Feldbrugge. Then in paragraph 29, the Strasbourg court has been left to develop the law. It's done so in two ways. First, it's been concerned to ensure that State parties do not exploit the gap left in Article 6 by changing their laws so as to convert a question which would ordinarily be regarded as appropriate. The civil adjudication into an administrative decision outside the reach of the article has done this by treating civil rights and obligations as an autonomous concept not dependent upon the domestic law, classification, right or obligation, which the citizens should have access to a court to determine, referring to Goudie in paragraph 30. The second development has been the doctrine, starting with Ringeisen in Austria in 1971 by which the Strasbourg court has extended Article 6 to cover a wide range of administrative decision making on the ground that the decision determines or decisively affects rights or obligations in private law. In a reference to Alconbury and then more recently, the scope of Article 6 has also been extended to public law rights, such as entitlement to Social Security or Welfare Benefit, and the publicly funded statutory schemes on the ground that they closely resemble writes in private law, referring to Salesi v Italy.

22	p1,01:35:56.960,01:36:38.100,spk_1,	True	Counsel: We rely on that, of course, and say there's no reason why the general provisions shouldn't apply in this particular case. And one sees that general proposition is supported in footnote 16 by reference to Salesi and Mennitto v Italy, and Schuler-Zgraggen and Switzerland and paragraph 40 continues. The court agrees with the parties the applicants claim for housing benefit concerned the determination of the civil rights from the Article 6(1) applied. So although that wasn't an issue, the court did express its agreement as that the applicants, therefore, had a right to a fair hearing before an independent part of funeral. 
22	p3,01:02:22.500,01:05:16.650,spk_2,	True	Counsel: It highlights the fact that this is a highly discretionary scheme. If you go to the top of page 456 in paragraph 67 the whole scheme is shot through with discretions, in which either the council's duty is dependent upon being satisfied of some state of affairs or can be discharged in various ways of its own choosing. By contrast, in Manito, the court said that the management committee of the local Public Health Service, after verifying that the applicant satisfied the conditions for entitlement to the allowance, should simply have made an arithmetical calculation of the quantum. So the discretionary elements in Part 7 were, in Lord Hoffman's view, extremely important. And it it's important to recognise the discretionary elements on a whole series of the stages in the Part seven decision making process. And then, in 69 between, uh, in about the sixth Line, he makes the same point as Lord Bingham that to accept this case, a part 7 claim, as being a civil right would be to go further than Strasburg has gone. And then he's in 70. He says he's not going to decide it. Then, looking briefly at the other members of the Judicial Committee, My Lord, Lord Hope Page 73 agreed with Lord Bingham and Lord Lord Hoffmann. Lord Millett also addressed civil rights in some detail, and the key concluding paragraphs are 90 onwards, where he deals with Silesia, Silesian Minuto, Felder Burger and 91. He says the present case undoubtedly goes further. Still, it has four features which take it beyond the existing law. It's benefiting kind. It involves priority between competing claimants for a finite amount of housing stock. Three. The Housing Authority has a discretion as to the manner in which it discharges its duty. And four ultimately, the question for determination calls for an exercise of judgement. And they're 92 he analyses those. And then, at the end, he says, Rana Begum cannot be said to be claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. He then, to be fair, says in 94. But he's persuaded by these considerations are extending the scope of Article 61 is a desirable end, but needs to go hand in hand with moderating the requirements in the interests of administration, where administrative decisions are involved and then says in the unsettled light of the case law, content to assume without deciding civil right.
22	p3,00:52:40.140,00:55:23.470,spk_2,	True	Absolutely, My lord. And again similar in some European schemes to a private insurance scheme. One then goes from there to the extension of that principle for contributory benefits to non contributory benefits. And that is the case law, Salesi against Italy and minuto against Italy. And if I just ask your Lordships and Lady to look at volume 7 tab 52. Just to summarise where one gets to in Selelaze is a non contributory welfare benefit scheme for the disabled. And what comes out of so lazy is that the distinction between contributory and non contributory benefits by 1993 when this judgement is given, was no longer one that could be sustained. And just to put that into a British context, if one thinks of the distinction between contributory benefits that one pays for through national insurance and non contributory benefits, that distinction has effectively been eaten away since the Second World War and is now very difficult to find in the legislation any principal distinction. So in so lazy, if one goes understand, take the key passages. If one goes to paragraph 19, where the court is dealing with the applicability of Article 19, it starts by the court, referring back to Felder Bruggere and in the third line of 19. At that time, the court noted, there was great diversity in the legislation and practise of the member states of the Council of Europe, has regarded the nature of entitlement to insurance benefits under social security schemes. Nevertheless, the development in the law that was initiated by those judgments and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 61 does apply in the field of social insurance. In the present case, however, the question arises in connection with welfare assistance and not, as previously cited social insurance. Certainly there are differences between the two, but they cannot be regarded as fundamental in the present stage of development of social security law. This justifies following in relation to the entitlement to welfare allowances. The opinion, which emerges from the aforementioned judgments as regard the classifications of the right to social insurance benefits, namely that state intervention is not sufficient to establish the Article 61 is inapplicable.
22	p1,01:27:02.050,01:28:05.040,spk_1,	False	Counsel: From paragraph 61 onwards, the second issue, the question of civil rights or determination is dealt with through almost the end of Lord Hoffmann. Speech Lord, in our submission, those are important passages. Yeah, then my Lord, that paragraph 73 Your Lordship agrees with my Lord being a man Lord Hoffmann and then from paragraph 74, Lord Millett, deals, with the issue, whether Article 61 is engaged. Yeah, and particularly draw attention to from paragraph 87, through to paragraph 93.

23	p3,01:55:38.080,01:56:14.460,spk_2,	True	Counsel: it's all historically interesting If nothing else. So My Lord, in my submission, the Strasbourg case law in respect of civil rights has not progressed any further than that considered by the House of Lords in Bagan and just to touch on Sophia. In this context, Sophia was of course, a case about housing benefit, which is a classic social security scheme, effectively in terms of entitlement very similar to the income support scheme.
23	p1,00:55:29.590,00:55:59.360,spk_0,	True	Court: So, have I got this right? That the chronology is that it was decisions under Article 6 that first recognised that non contributory cash state benefits were a civil right, and it was because of that that in Stec, they said, and its property within the meaning of Article 1 of protocol 1 that's that's the right way around? Counsel: My Lady, Yes. Court: Not that somebody decided it was property under Article 1 of Protocol 1, and therefore somebody said, Well, of course, Article 6 must apply?

23	p3,01:56:15.510,01:59:23.660,spk_2,	True	Counsel: And in Sofia, the UK government didn't contest that Article 61 was engaged and in my submission, very strongly. Contrary to what my learning from Mr Gowdy has said, there is a complete contrast for these purposes between the Housing benefit Scheme and rights under Part seven of the Housing Act to housing housing benefit is a cash benefit. It is subject to a precise set of legally hard edged criteria, and once one is entitled, there is an arithmetical calculation as to what one is entitled to in terms of amount. It therefore stands on all falls with Benito, and in my submission, it is utterly different. For the purposes of Article 61 from mhm the part seven rights before I make submissions on part seven. Specifically, Can I just ask your Lordships briefly to look at em in Croydon? In respect of civil rights? Of course, the comments in the opinions are over to there because, uh, your Lordships, tomorrow day after tomorrow, we're going to find against the secretary of state on and against the respondents on domestic point. But both my Lady Hale and Lord Hope did deal with civil rights, albeit briefly. First of all, Lady Hale at paragraph 39 refers to Bagan refers to, uh, the Russian cases and refers to so lazy and then in paragraph 40 um, first to the Russian cases not being based on any argument and then at the bottom of page 24 any entitlement under Section 21 that's the Children Act, which was an issue in that case, does not depend upon discretion. But it does depend upon an evaluation of some very soft criteria rather than specific rules. And it is difficult to say at what point the applicant may consider himself to be the holder of such a right. Hence, as my Lord Walker observed in Rana Begum, if they write, such as this is a civil right at all. It must lie close to the boundary of the concept and not at the core of what it entails. If so, this may have consequences for the second question, which is what Article six requires. And in my submission, the same points would be made here. If you get a right under Part seven, it is subject to some very soft criteria, and I'll come back to that in a moment.

The approach to be applied. It's necessary to examine the pressure. The question whether a claim to a non contributory welfare benefits should protect protection of after one a critical one and paragraph 47. The convention must be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between the various provisions going to various earlier cases. It's noteworthy in this respect that in the case law on the applicability of Article 6, the court originally held the claims regarding only welfare benefits which form part of contributory scheme where because of the similarity to private insurance schemes are sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of the scheme,

23	p3,00:44:52.090,00:51:52.700,spk_2,	True	Counsel My lord. My lady. As your lordship’s know I am going to deal in its entirety with the first issue. Whether it's a civil right, I'm only going to deal with the second issue to the degree to make some supplementary comments, supplementary submissions to my friend Mr Arden's submissions. And then I will deal briefly with the matter of remedy. Where Mr Arden and I disagree, so far as the issue of Is this a civil right is concerned. Just so your lordships relationship know where I'm going. I'm going to deal first fairly quickly with the Strasbourg case law before Begum quickly because it's summarised in considerable depth in Begum. Then I will touch on Begum in relation to the civil rights issue. Then I will deal with the post Begum Strasbourg cases, then the Croydon case and lastly apply the tests to Part 7 of the Housing Act. Um, now in terms of the case law, up to Begum in respect of civil rights. First of all, it's important just to make clear there is no issue here that the claimants had some form of right, um, that's not disputed, and therefore the only question is whether it is a civil right within the meaning of Article 6. And it is, as your lordships will know very well clearly established that a civil right for the purposes of Article 6 is an autonomous concept. In other words, the way that it's described in domestic law is not determinative of whether it's a civil right or not, and again, to state what is certainly well known to my Lady Hale and my Lord I Hope from the Croydon case, Article 6 has extended into what English lawyers would consider two areas extended into what we would call public law in two ways. First of all, there are a series of cases about public law determinations which impact on private law rights, of which the classic examples are licencing. Decisions such as Kingsley planning decisions such as Brian and decisions relating to employment rights such as Albert and Lake Cont and into that category also now falls the case of Crompton, which relates to private law employment rights, albeit with a slight complication that it was a territorial army case. That line of cases in terms of is it a civil right is not what is an issue today. It's the second line of cases where there is a determination of a claim for a Social Security benefit, which is being suggested by my learned friends, has extended into Part 7 of the Housing Act and at that line of cases, really starts with the decision of the European court in a case called Felder Broker, which is in Volume 6 at tab 40. Uh huh and, yeah, Felda Brugger was a case concerning Dutch Social Security benefits, which were contributory benefits. In other words, the claimant had made payments under the equivalent of our national insurance scheme and whether her claim for the benefits fell within the term civil rights for Article 6 and I'll take your lordships in a moment to the key paragraphs. But the point of Felda Burger was that the European Court found that when it was a contributory benefits, it was directly analogous with a private insurance scheme benefit and therefore, in the same way that a private insurance scheme would give you the right to a would give a civil right and therefore Article 6 rights. If it was a contributory scheme, the same analysis must apply, and that's where one gets to Infeld a burger at paragraphs. Key part starts at page 8, paragraph 32. The European Court looks at the features of public law and says in 32 the first such factors as the character of the legislation. The legal rules governing Social Security benefits in the context of health insurance differ in many respects from the rules which apply to insurance in general, which are part of civil war civil law. The Netherlands state has assumed the responsibility of regulating the framework of the health health insurance scheme and overseeing the operation of that scheme. To this end, it specifies the categories of beneficiaries, defines the limits of the protection afforded, lays down the rates of the contributions and the allowances, et cetera, and that last sentence is important because it's picked up later in terms of the need for precise and clear rules. If one is to have an Article 6 civil right, then Paragraph 33 a second factor of relevance is the obligation to be insured against illness or, more precisely, the fact of being covered by insurance in the event of fulfilling the conditions laid down by the legislation. In other words, those concerned can either opt out of the benefits nor avoid having to pay the relevant contributions. And then, in 37 onwards, the court points to the private law features of the right and first of all, the personal and economic nature of the asserted right, a phrase which comes up again and again in the case law to begin with Paragraph 37. Mrs Feldberg was not affected in her relation with the public authorities as such acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, but in her personal capacity as a private individual, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming a right flowing from the specific rules laid down by the legislation in force. For the individual averting it such a right is often a crucial importance. This is especially so in the case of health insurance benefits, when the employee who is unable to work by reason of illness enjoys no other source of income. In short, the right in question was a personal, economic and individual right factor that brought it close to the civil sphere. And they go on in 38 to talk about the relationship with the employment contract, thus tying it in at that stage into private law rights.
23	p3,01:06:13.910,01:06:50.210,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Undoubtedly, there are protections that judicial review, of course, but I'm not in a position to speculate as to whether in other jurisdictions you might have a situation with no protection and, of course, referring to case or that I'm sure your lordships familiar with it will undoubtedly have been the case in a case like Geiger zoos. Where, unless the case fell within the ambit of Article 1 protocol 1, the Austrian government could racially discriminate between ethnic Austrians and non ethnic Austrians that the European Court would be keen to ensure that that kind of dispute did fall within some kind of control.
23	p3,00:55:39.340,00:57:09.460,spk_2,	True	Counsel: As in the two cases previously referred to, other considerations argue in favour of the applicability of Article 61. In the instant case, the most important of these lies in the fact that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, Mrs Salahi was not affected and her relations with the administrative authorities as such. Acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute giving effect to the Constitution. Um, so that's where the law has got to on Social Security benefits, My lords, your lordships, no minuto Is that volume 7 tab 48 but I don't think it's necessary to go to that effectively repeats the Celozzi tasks. And in my submission, what comes out of those tests? Those case law up to that stage is that in order to fall within Article 61, it needs to be an economic and individual right. It needs to be a right flowing from specific rules, and it needs to be a right arising from a scheme where there is no discretion in the method of meeting the right. So just to counter submission, that was certainly made strongly in Croydon. The issue is not whether the right is something that is important to somebody. It might be very important, but that doesn't make it a civil right.
23	p1,01:35:56.960,01:36:38.100,spk_1,	True	Counsel We rely on that, of course, and say there's no reason why the general provisions shouldn't apply in this particular case. And one sees that general proposition is supported in footnote 16 by reference to Salesi and Mennitto v Italy, and Schuler-Zgraggen and Switzerland and paragraph 40 continues. The court agrees with the parties the applicants claim for housing benefit concerned the determination of the civil rights from the Article 6(1) applied. So although that wasn't an issue, the court did express its agreement as that the applicants, therefore, had a right to a fair hearing before an independent part of funeral.

23	p3,01:14:02.030,01:15:48.460,spk_2,	True	Counsel: I think, to go off precisely relevant point to the case, my lady. My understanding is that under the old Soviet system that were very precise per metre allocations, depending on various criteria. Paragraph 40 alleged violation of Article 61 of the convention. The court reiterates that Article 61 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to the civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way, it embodies the right to report of which the right of access that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters constitutes one aspect. However, that right would be illusory. If a contracting states domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party, it would be inconceivable that Article 61 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions to construe. Article 6 is being concerned exclusively. The access to a court and conduct of proceedings will be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law, which the contracting states undertook to respect when they ratified the convention. Execution of a judgement given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the trial for the purposes of Article 6 of Hornsby. So, my Lord, in my submission, that's the ratio of this case, and that is the pattern of all the subsequent cases. They focus on the non enforceability of the court orders in question. In each case, there is no reference to field of rigour line of cases, and there is no suggestion that there was any intention to extend the case law.
23	p4,01:09:10.569,01:10:59.870,spk_2,	True	Counsel: My Lords and my Lady, as regards whether the appellant undoubted rights are civil rights, it's now, of course, firmly established that rights are not prevented from being civil rights because they have a public nature. The law has, as Miss Lieven accepts, moved on since in Feldbrugge and the test is as stated in Salesi and Minnetto as regards social security and, uh, in our submission social welfare benefits, that is, is one talking about an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. That is the test upon which we seek to rely. And Strasbourg has not carved out an exclusion for benefits in kind. On the contrary, it has extended property rights by accepting in a series of cases that a property right can be constituted by a legitimate expectation. And that is supported by the Italian POW case in an earlier passage than those to which the court's attention had been drawn so far, Paragraph 62 and 64 referring to Kopecky and as the court has seen by the Teteriny line of authorities to Teteriny itself at paragraphs 45 to 47. But here, the right is more crystallised and stronger than simply a legitimate expectation. If the criteria are satisfied, then the right exists, there is no discretion. There is a duty.
23	p1,00:39:22.620,00:43:18.130,spk_1,	True	Counsel: It arising where particular qualifying conditions are met constitutes a right. My Lord, that's not an issue. Secondly, Section 193 subsection 2 of the Housing Act confers such a right again, not an issue. Yeah, thirdly, and again, not an issue that right continues until it ceases by virtue of any of the following provisions of Section 193. And fourthly, we submit this is where one does enter into controversy. We submit that the decision ultimately by the review officer, that the right has since with the determination of a civil right for article 6 purposes and that's the nub of the matter. For the purposes of the first issue my Lord's and my Lady, it is well established and not in dispute that is generally sufficient in order to constitute a civil right for article 6 purposes for there to be an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. So the 6 necessary and we say sufficient components of the civil right. First of all, that there is a right. Secondly, that the right is an economic right. Thirdly, that the economic right is an individual, right? Fourthly, that the right flows from rules. Fifthly, that those are specific rules, and sixthly that there are rules laid down in the statute in our case, shortly stated as we submit that each of those components is manifestly fully satisfied, that, looking at the question whether there is an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute was established as being the appropriate test by the Strasbourg court in cases such as Salesi and Italy and Mennitto and Italy. Cases involving non contributory social welfare benefits as do the present cases and that principle, we say, applies here that the right to accommodation is an individual right as much as any cash benefit. It's an economic right as much as any cash benefit. It flows from specific rules in part 7 of the Housing Act. And we submit the fact that part 7 of the Housing Act may be regarded as part of a scheme of social welfare provision does not affect the salacious classification. Again, it's clearly established by a series of Strasbourg decisions and is not in dispute that the right to a social Security or welfare benefit is not withstanding its public nature well capable of being a civil right.
23	p1,00:54:04.210,00:55:29.580,spk_1,	True	Counsel: They were because of the similarity private insurance schemes sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of dispute for the determination of civil rights, see Feldbrugge and Deumeland. However, in the Salesi v Italy judgement Article 61 was held by a dispute over entitled to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising the the applicant had an assertive all right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison private insurance schemes and the requirement reform of contract between the individual and the State. In Schuler-Zgraggen, the court held development in the law and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance insurance, including even welfare assistance, then this important passage in paragraph 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the conventions that, the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one of protocol, one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights under Article 6(1). And we would submit, like quite the converse. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation about one of protocol, one which avoids inequalities, treatment based on distinctions, which at the present day, imperial logical or unsustainable.

23	p1,00:08:40.680,00:12:09.660,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lord. Certainly, I'm going to come to the question of a practical considerations, which weighed heavily with the Court of Appeal and indeed with the judges in the county court and my Lord the, but in our submission put shortly there is. It is a perfectly workable arrangement, if that is what is needed, that one has certain aspects decided in one way and others in another. My Lord, my sixth. That preliminary point was the well, it's the point that I've made that the about yes, the seventh is that although, and this indeed is the point. Lady Hale has already raised that, although both the Ali and Ibrahim cases involved the issue of whether a particular letter has been received. Of course, cases that turn only on the resolution of fact can arise in other ways. In the homelessness context of which Tomlinson is an example, and my Lords and my Lady, this leaves 2 areas of major controversy. There is a third area of controversy in relation to remedy, whether it must be a declaration of incompatibility or not. But on the substance of the matter. Two major issues first were the council's adverse credibility findings against both appellants and consequent abandonment of the councils housing duties towards the appellant determinations of civil rights of the appellant's for Article six purposes. That is therefore, the determination not only at rights which plainly they are but of civil rights. We submit that they were civil rights that matters, what the Housing Act conferred, and secondly, if so, does Article six require a full merits review. In our submission, It does, in a case which turns on a simple question of primary fact with no specialist expertise required to determine it and no element of policy or discretion involved in the determination. Well, this latter submission well, the former submission involves the determination of a case that was not determined as such in Runa Begum, but was the assumption upon which the house proceeded. The latter submission involves either distinguishing or overruling the decision of the House of Lords in the Runa Begum case on suitability of accommodation. My Lord, another way of putting that submission is that it gives effect to the decision of the Strasbourg court in Tsfayo, in the UK and now also, we would say to the very recent and important decision of the Strasbourg court in Crompton and the UK a decision more recent even than our printed case, my Lord before coming in a moment to the first issue that is determination of civil rights. I should perhaps say a word about the composite expression in Article 6, an independent and impartial tribunal. 
23	p3,01:36:47.860,01:38:57.850,spk_2,	True	Counsel: At paragraphs 47 48. In the admissibility decision, the court dealt with this matter 47. The convention must also be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions. It is noteworthy in this respect that in its case law on the applicability of Article 61, the court originally held that claims only wealth claims regarding only welfare benefits which form part of a contributory schemes, were because of the similarity to private insurance schemes sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of disputes for the determination of civil rights. Seefeld Burger, However, in so lazy article 61 was held also to apply to a dispute over entitlement to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising that the applicant had an assessor to bill, right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison with private insurance schemes and the requirements for a form of contract between the individual and the state and then his reference to Shoeless Kragen and then 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the convention as a whole that the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one protocol one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of peculiar rights. Under Article 61. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation of Article one protocol, one which avoids inequalities of treatment based on distinctions which in the present day appear illogical or unsustainable. So that's where the courts saying the two articles should go hand in hand. And then my learned friend Mr Gowdy goes from there to suggest well, Article 1 Protocol 1 would support his analysis that benefits in kind, such as those under Part 7 fall within Article 1, Protocol 1, and for that purpose I want I've brought an additional authority.
24	p4,01:11:00.870,01:13:50.430,spk_2,	True	Counsel: fact that the duty may be discharged in different ways, provided always that it is discharged, that does not detract from the right and you do not need a judgement in your favour in order to have achieved the right. A right pursuant to statute is as much a civil right as a right pursuant to a judgement. If statutory rights exist, they do so whether or not a court has declared that they exist or if they've been denied, a mandatory order has been made with respect to them. A court order is not necessary in order for civil rights to crystallise and, were the position otherwise, it would be somewhat fortuitous and arbitrary. And the identification of a particular property is not an ingredient of the existence of the right. The right to have accommodation provided or secure, for one is itself a discreet right. It's not emasculated as such on account of separate questions that may arise in relation either to the performance of the duty or to the cessation of the duty and the Part 7, Section 193, Subsection 2 right indeed contrasts in that respect with the non-rights under Part 6 of the same act and the Part 7 Housing Act scheme, homelessness scheme is, moreover, similar to, rather than different from, cash benefits in having evaluative elements. Of course, if contrary to our submissions, one is looking at the scheme as a whole, then one can indeed point to evaluative elements in the homelessness scheme. But so, too, the housing benefit and other cash benefit schemes contain evaluative elements. By way of example only, housing benefit evaluation includes, considering whether there is a sham arrangement, whether there has been a deliberate deprivation of capital, and evaluation which compares rather with intentionality in the homeless scheme. And I think the one bundle the court hasn't looked at so far is Volume 2, which is devoted entirely to the housing benefit regulations, I think it's in fact, the current regulations that are there rather than earlier versions.
24	p1,01:10:09.430,01:13:18.070,spk_1,	True	Counsel: And my Lord, It is, of course, an important feature of the statutory scheme. Yeah, that someone who is in priority need and not homeless intentionally and who is entitled to accommodation doesn't lose that accommodation because they decline a particular offer of accommodation which they don't regard as being suitable unless it has, in terms been drawn to their attention that they will lose the right. So it is important whether or not a letter of this kind is received. And more generally, part seven of the act relating to duties the homeless and their entitlements is very different from part six relating to the regulation of schemes for the allocation of housing and not giving anyone a right to accommodation. My Lord is it, um, said in this respect, part 7 of the Housing Act is similar to section 20 subsection 1 of the 1989 Children Act. Then I respond. Yes, in many ways it is. And that that assists me in that if who is a child is a question of precedent or jurisdictional fact on the construction of the Children's Act. That one has, of course, to look at the construction in our case of the Housing Act. And what as this court has seen, is in terms of Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. The first gateway question of fact is what the applicant informed of the possible consequences of refusal and the right to review. If so, the second gateway question of fact is, Did the applicant refused the accommodation? And then it's both those facts are established so that one is through the two gateways. Then one has the further question, not a question of fact arising. The Runa Begum question whether the authority are satisfied that the accommodation was suitable. So if and insofar as the authority is relying on Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. And then the suitability issue. If they're relying on Section 193, subsection seven, then that is exclusively a question of fact. And my Lord, What we say is that these gateway questions of fact or exclusive questions of fact are eminently questions for a court, either as precedent questions or subsequent questions upon review for appeal.
24	p3,02:07:34.280,02:09:26.900,spk_2,	True	Counsel: This, again, involves soft edged criteria under 189(1a) Who might you reasonably be expected to reside with? Are you residing with dependent Children or might be reasonably expected to reside with them? And are you vulnerable as a result of old age section 190 Intentional homelessness? I'm sure anybody who has sat in the administrative court in the days when these cases came before it will realise how very judgmental and how difficult those decisions are, and a whole series of judgements have to be made as to whether somebody's homeless, intentionally or not. Now, my lords, I don't want to be put to Hi. I'm not suggesting that you can get in Social Security schemes, eh? Value some evaluative judgments. Was it reasonable for you to take a job in jobseekers allowance? So I'm not saying that these are knockout points individually, but in terms of, do you even get the right? This is a very soft edge set of criteria where there's a great scope for professional judgement all along the way. But the second point, it is in my submission, one that does differ starkly from social security schemes because that involves the way the right is met itself involves a high level of discretion. So the duty under section 1932 is simply to secure. Accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant.

Uh, Section 176. The meaning of accommodation available for occupation and section, 177 deals with whether it's reasonable to continue to occupy accommodation. I think I could go a number of pages forward to page 20 of the extract, a group of sections dealing with applications for assistance in case of homelessness or threatened homelessness. Section 183, the application following provisions of this part apply where a person applies to a local housing authority for accommodation for assistance in explaining it, and the authorities have reason to believe that he is or may be homeless or threatened with homelessness. Section 184 then relates to the inquiry to be made. If there is that reason to believe, then the authorities shall make such enquiries as necessary to satisfy themselves. Firstly, whether he is eligible for assistance and secondly, if so, whether any duty and if so, what duty is owed to him under the following provisions of this part. And then there's a notification requirement of the outcome and reasons in subsection 3 and then and section 188 at the bottom of page 25 there is an interim duty to accommodate in case of apparent priority need. Section 189 relates to priority needs. The various categories, including little be a person with whom dependent Children reside or might reasonably be expected to reside covers both present cases and then dealing with the post inquiry situation. The post Interim situation from Section 19 onwards the duty to duties The person is found to be homeless or threatened with homelessness. First of all, in section one, I know the duty to persons becoming homeless intentionally. So not our case and section 191 begin deals with becoming homeless intentionally in section 192 duty to persons not in priority need who are not homeless intentionally again not our case and then section 193 is our case duty to persons with priority need who are not homeless intentionally. This section applies where the authorities are satisfied that an applicant is homeless eligible for assistance has a priority need and they're not satisfied that he became homeless intentionally Unless the authority refer the application to another local housing authority doesn't arise here They shall secure that accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant. That in our submission is the key provisions they shall secure that accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant and then subsection three The authority are subject to the duty under this section until it ceases by virtue of any of the following provisions of this section and subsection five. The local authorities shall cease to be subject to the duty under the section if the applicant this having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and it is right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation. Secondly, refuses an offer of accommodation. And thirdly, that's an offer of accommodation which the authorities are satisfied is suitable for them.

It had said that in previous or words to that effect, or somebody who appeared to the local authority to be a child in a previous version of the legislation. But it didn't say that in the 1989 Act. Now one of the points about part 7 is that all the way through it says if the local authority is satisfied, if the local authority is satisfied about almost everything, suitability, homelessness this that and the other which suggests, of course, that a deliberate decision has been taken as to who is to be the fact finder in these cases. To what extent is that relevant to what we have, its relevant to the argument that Lord Browne raised about: What's the difference between this case and Croydon? I'm not sure that it's relevant at all to the Article 6 point.

And with all that in our submission is the present situation. Once the local authority are satisfied, the statutory criteria for providing accommodation exists, then the authority has no discretion.

They have to secure its provisions and have to do so irrespective of resource considerations, irrespective of local conditions of demand and supply. And we rely on this connection.

So, my lords, in my submission, for all those reasons we see a scheme under part seven, which is, although the duty itself is not subject to the discretion and as much as once you have the right section 1935 puts a duty on the local authority not a power. But whether you get the right precisely, the forms of the right, and how you lose the right to highly judgmental, starkly contrasted with anything that the European Court has found falls within Article 61 and then finally on engagement. My Lord, My Lords, I do want to stress the point that was made very strongly in Croydon. If Article 61 is engaged by a claim under Part seven, then it is very difficult to see why it would not also be engaged by a series of other local authority decisions in the area of welfare, and the most obvious ones are those under the National Assistance Act.

It doesn't say the tenure of the accommodation. It doesn't say the location of the 10th of the accommodation. All those are matters of judgement for the local authority and in my submission that is in very stark contrast to housing benefit in Sofia or to the disability benefit in Veneto, which are simply arithmetical calculations on the financial benefit that accrues once you've got your entitlement, Then the decision makers simply talks up the elements. And that's in total contrast in my submission to the nature of the duty and how it's discharged in section 1932 and then The third contrast, which again, in my submission, is very great to any social security scheme is the way the duty can be discharged in 1935 and 75. The local housing authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequences of refusal and of his right to review to request a review, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged under that having discharged their duty under this section and then seven. The local housing authority should also cease to be subject to a duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses a final offer of accommodation under part six. So, my lords, under this scheme, the right is lost. Yeah, if the view is taken that there has been an offer of accommodation which was suitable for him, and that necessarily involves a huge element of judgement discretion. However, you want to put it as to whether a suitable offer was made. There is no equivalent to that in housing benefit. For example, you can only lose your housing benefit if you cease to be entitled because you no longer meet the hard edged criteria. Part seven is completely different.

If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him, and the authority notify him, that they regard themselves after having discharged their duty under this section. Now, the first point to make is an obvious one. Unlike Section 20 of the Children Act, the section, subsection 1935 doesn't distinguish between different limbs that might be said, we're not talking about domestic precedent fact here, but that might be said within Article 6 terms, somehow to be discreet questions of fact. You can see that even within section 1935, there are certain things that might be argued by lawyers to be discreet. Have you been informed? Did you get the letter? Have you been informed of the possible consequence of refusal? Now, is that a discreet fact? Or is that a judgement? In other words, that becomes: was the letter good enough? So you got the letter that's not in dispute. But you say that this letter didn't tell me about the possible consequence of refusal. This letter missed the point. So is that a discreet question of fact? And then, very similarly of his right to request a review of the suitability, was that sufficiently clear? And then the next bit is if the applicant refuses an offer of accommodation, well, you can see that that could be analysed as a question of fact. Did your letter back refuse the offer, or was it more equivocal? One can see, in particular cases that might arise, and then which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him. Well, I think everybody would agree that was a judgement call and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged their duty. Well again. That could be: Did you get the letter? But it could also be questions within the letter as to whether it was clear or not. So, my Lord, in my submission, attempts to try to divide off one particular factual, inverted commas, issue only is going to give rise to a domino effect of other potential factual issues that could be argued to be discreet or in a non domestic sense conditions precedent. So in my submission, the statutory scheme, statutory words do not at all support an analysis that there are discrete questions of fact which can be wholly divorced from the rest of the part seven decision.

There are therefore various forms of tenure, which will which will suffice. Um, but it is a tenancy that will be forthcoming. We respectfully submit that the position is as stated by Baroness Hale, then Lady Justice Hale in the Adan v Newham case, not the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal. But in our submission the correct view. Um, well, that's in Volume 3 of the authorities at the first case in that volume at 10. And Lady Justice Hale. Judgement begins paragraph 52 that page 2136 of the law report. And at the bottom of that page, article 61 is set out and then over the top of the next page miss Booth has accepted for the purpose of this hearing that the determination of an application for accommodation for for assistance in obtaining accommodation under Part seven is the determination of his civil rights and obligations and then continuing. The European Court of Human Rights has held that the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance, including even welfare assistance see Schuler-Zgraggen, see also Feldbrugge and Deumeland . Those cases were concerned what we would call social security benefits. But the court pointed out that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, the applicant was not only affected in her relations with the administrative authorities as such, but also suffered an interference with her means of subsistence. She was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in case of Germany in a federal statute and then continuing with the judgement to claim for accommodation under part 7 is also it is accepted for present purposes, such a right once the locals and then this is the key passage. Once the local authority are satisfied that the statutory criteria for providing accommodation exists, they have no discretion. They have to provide its irrespective of local conditions of demand and supply, hence this is more akin to a claim for Social Security benefits than it is a claim for social or other services where the authorities have a greater degree of discretion and resource considerations may also be relevant. Nevertheless, as Miss Booth points out the nature of the decision making process required by Article 61 differs according to the nature of the right being claimed, referring to Albert v Belgium adopting the concept of full jurisdiction. As Lord Hoffmann explained in Alconbury, subsequent European authorities shows the full jurisdiction does not mean full decision making power. It means full jurisdiction to deal with the case, as the nature of the decision requires. In assessing the sufficiency of the decision making process, under part seven must be relevant that authorities, with all the internal external controls to which they are subject to involved. On the other hand, decisions to house the homeless are quite different. The Secretary of State's decisions and planning and compulsory purchase with which the House of Lords was concerned, and Alconbury in that case, Will Hoffman drew a distinction between policy decisions what interest requires, which one would expect. One would expect to be taken by democratically accountable bodies and the determination of rights and then a short quotation followed by this. Decisions are under part seven of the 1996 Act's and not in any sense policy decisions as to what the public interest requires. And the policy decisions were taken by Parliament when it enacted the 1996 Act. Individual eligibility decisions are taken in the first instance by local housing authorities. But policy questions to the availability of resources or equity between the homeless and those on the waiting list for social housing are irrelevant to individual eligibility. Or we respectfully adopt all of that. My Lord, while we have the case to hand later on in the judgement of Lady Justice Hale observations which in our submission are relevant on the question of whether the result we contend can be achieved by means of section 3 of the act.

Whether the power of judicial review is sufficiently wide to satisfy the requirements of Article six must, in my view, depend on a number of considerations, including the subject matter of the dispute, the nature of the decision of the administrative authorities, which is in question the procedure, if any, which exists for review of the decision by a personal body acting independently of the authority concerned and the scope of that power of review. In my view, the powers of review of the High Court, when combined with the statutory arrangements under the 1990 Act for appealing against an enforcement notice, satisfy the requirements of Article 61, and it's that passage which then finds its way into the court judgement at paragraph 45.

26	p3,02:09:39.430,02:12:24.970,spk_2,	True	Counsel: No. The point is, all that has to be done is to secure accommodation. It doesn't say the form of the accommodation. It doesn't say the tenure of the accommodation. It doesn't say the location of the 10th of the accommodation. All those are matters of judgement for the local authority and in my submission that is in very stark contrast to housing benefit in Sofia or to the disability benefit in Veneto, which are simply arithmetical calculations on the financial benefit that accrues once you've got your entitlement, Then the decision makers simply talks up the elements. And that's in total contrast in my submission to the nature of the duty and how it's discharged in section 1932 and then The third contrast, which again, in my submission, is very great to any social security scheme is the way the duty can be discharged in 1935 and 75. The local housing authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequences of refusal and of his right to review to request a review, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged under that having discharged their duty under this section and then seven. The local housing authority should also cease to be subject to a duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses a final offer of accommodation under part six. So, my lords, under this scheme, the right is lost. Yeah, if the view is taken that there has been an offer of accommodation which was suitable for him, and that necessarily involves a huge element of judgement discretion. However, you want to put it as to whether a suitable offer was made. There is no equivalent to that in housing benefit. For example, you can only lose your housing benefit if you cease to be entitled because you no longer meet the hard edged criteria. Part seven is completely different.
26	p1,00:54:04.210,00:55:29.580,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Because of the similarity, private insurance schemes sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of dispute for the determination of civil rights, see Feldbrugge and Deumeland. However, in the Salesi v Italy judgement Article 61 was held by a dispute over entitled to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising the the applicant had an assertive all right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison private insurance schemes and the requirement reform of contract between the individual and the State. In Schuler-Zgraggen, the court held development in the law and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance insurance, including even welfare assistance, then this important passage in paragraph 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the conventions that, the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one of protocol, one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights under Article 6(1). And we would submit, like quite the converse. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation about one of protocol, one which avoids inequalities, treatment based on distinctions, which at the present day, imperial logical or unsustainable.

Equality -- is this quality rather review sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 61 on the assumption that a civil right is an issue playing that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently credible conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authorities. The question is whether this limitation on the county court judges role deprives him of the jurisdiction necessary. Satisfy the requirements of Article 61 in the present context. In approaching this question, I regard three matters as particularly pertinent. First of all, part 7 is only part of a far reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing administration that scheme very largely entrusted to local housing authorities. While the homelessness provisions are intended to assist those individuals who are or may become homeless, there is a wider public dimension to the problem of homelessness. Secondly, although, as in the present case an authority may have to resolve disputes, factual issues, it's factual findings will only be staging posts on the way too much the much broader judgments which the authority has made in deciding whether it owes the full housing duty to an applicant under Section 1931, the authority has to be satisfied of 3 matters and not satisfied of another. Under 1937(b), the authority ceases to be subject full housing duty if it is satisfied that the accommodation offered to the applicant was suitable for the applicant and that it was reasonable for him to accept it. Thus, it is the authorities judgement which matters, and it is unlikely to be a simple factual decision. Yes, and then Thirdly, there's reference to the review regulations, and over the page of Paragraph 10 was referenced the question of contracting out, whether that be desirable or not, and in paragraph 11 in relation to the requirements of Article 6(1) are supplied to the review by a court that administrative decision made by a body not closed with the independence and impartiality required of Judicial Tribunal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence, as in relation to civil rights, has shown a degree of flexibility in its search for just and workman like submission solutions and then certain recent authorities of particular importance, including Byran and the UK and Kingsley in the UK amongst others. None of these cases is indistinguishable from the present, but taken together, they provide compelling support the conclusion that in a context such as this, the absence of a full fact finding jurisdiction in the tribunal, which appeal lies for an administrative decision making body does not disqualify that tribunal for the purpose of Article 6(1). This is a conclusion which I accept more readily because it gives effect to a procedure laid down by Parliament, which should properly operated, ensure fair treatment that such as Runa Begum Then there is the speech of Lord Hoffmann, and I can perhaps pick that up at paragraph 27 on page 445.

26	p4,00:49:11.770,00:52:08.210,spk_1,	True	CouIt all has to come together. Then you look at the nature of the issues that arise and the issues that arise under this scheme are those that in general require professional judgement and expertise. Looking at the scheme as a whole, it is not a scheme where there are simple questions of fact that lead to the end conclusion, like Minnetto or Tsfayo. And yes, there may be factual disputes in there. But that's part of the decision-making process, which requires the professional judgments. And then you look at the content of the dispute itself here. The alleged breach of Article six is that the reviewing officer is not independent. That is exactly the same as the argument in Runa Begum. It is in contrast to the argument in Tsfayo, but also to put it in the context of the case law. It's in contrast with a case like Wright where the court may remember that in Wright, the alleged breach of Article six or well the found breach of Article six was a complete denial of any right to make representations. So you, and the consequence of that decision, was that the person usually less lost their job, not always but on the fact that was very often going to be the result. So you've got a major departure from the principles of a fair trial, fair hearing combined with the very draconian consequence. Whereas here, you've got structural ind, lack of independence. But in terms of that breach and the consequences of that breach, nobody suggested the consequences aren't serious, but they're not in article six terms, the same as losing your job. Because of the. I'm sorry, I should explain that I'm getting into shorthand at this stage. Because that is such a clear attack on your private law rights. The consequence in Wright. You have a private contract of employment and that had to be terminated by statutory process if you were put on the provisional list. So that is an absolutely classic central civil right that has just been interfered with. Whereas here, we are on the absolute edge of a Part 7 right and whether they are Article six rights at all. So you can see the way all these issues intermesh in each other.

And this is a case in which the court concluded that an application for judicial review by the individual concerned did have sufficiency of review to remedy the lack of independence this is the reasoning by which the court came to that conclusion, in that particular case, that is instructive. And there's certainly that there are no suggestion in Crompton, that a key feature about Tsfayo is the council having been a judge in its own cause or the position of the decision having been made by members rather than officers. What one sees is that Tsfayo is again and again treated as being of wider importance in its particular factual context. Paragraph 50 on page seven of the decision, under the heading D towards the bottom of the page, the scope of judicial review of administrative decision making. The court observes that the scope of judicial review in administrative decision making in the United Kingdom is set out in the court judgement in Tsfayo. Then, turning to the law and halfway down page 8, the applicability of Article six of the proceedings, the government accepted that the African civil rights were determined in the domestic proceedings and Article six was applicable. So this is an authority on the sufficiency of review element, and the court's assessment is from towards the bottom of page 11, that will be the court's assessment and then roman one general principles. Beginning with paragraph 40 The court recalls that even where an adjudicatory body, determining disputes over civil rights and obligations does not comply with Article 6(1) in some respect, no violation of the convention can be found if the proceedings before that body are subject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and does provide the guarantees of Article 6(1). So the question is always whether there is or is not full jurisdiction. Paragraph 71, the court has previously held that in order to determine whether the Article six compliant second tier tribunal had full jurisdiction or provided sufficiency of review to remedy a lack of independence, of first instance, it was necessary to have regard to such factors as the subject matter of the decision appealed against, the manner in which that decision was arrived at and the contents of the dispute, including the desired and actual ground of appeal. See Bryan and Tsfayo. In Bryan, the court found it reasonable that the jurisdiction of the High Court to review findings of fact made at first instance, be limited to considering whether the findings of facts or the inferences based on them were perverse or unreasonable. It reached that conclusion in light of the specialised area of law, an issue in the dispute and the expertise of the inspector in establishing the facts and exercising discretion on a wide range of policy matters accordingly, judicial review in that case offered sufficiency of review and the proceedings, complied with Article 6(1). The convention organs followed the approach set out in Bryan to find that judicial review did provide sufficiency of review in a number of cases against the United Kingdom.

I returned to the other two issue in dispute, and then refers to how they may relate to each other, referring to a dissenting opinion in Feldbrugge. Then in paragraph 29, the Strasbourg court has been left to develop the law. It's done so in two ways. First, it's been concerned to ensure that State parties do not exploit the gap left in Article 6 by changing their laws so as to convert a question which would ordinarily be regarded as appropriate. The civil adjudication into an administrative decision outside the reach of the article has done this by treating civil rights and obligations as an autonomous concept not dependent upon the domestic law, classification, right or obligation, which the citizens should have access to a court to determine, referring to Goudie in paragraph 30. The second development has been the doctrine, starting with Ringeisen in Austria in 1971 by which the Strasbourg court has extended Article 6 to cover a wide range of administrative decision making on the ground that the decision determines or decisively affects rights or obligations in private law. In a reference to Alconbury and then more recently, the scope of Article 6 has also been extended to public law rights, such as entitlement to Social Security or Welfare Benefit, and the publicly funded statutory schemes on the ground that they closely resemble writes in private law, referring to Salesi v Italy.
27	p1,01:17:52.940,01:20:01.620,spk_1,	False	Counsel: thus far, I support what the decision says, the reasons that are there given. But then, on the question of civil rights from paragraph five onwards where reference is made to Alconbury, Lord Bingham states at paragraph 6, the European courts approach to rights deriving from social welfare schemes has been complicated by differences of legal tradition in various Member States. As Lord Hoffman explained in Alconbury comparison Feldbrugge in the Netherlands and Deumeland in Germany in the 1986 with Salesi and Italy, and Mennitto and Italy shows movement from a narrower towards a broader interpretation of civil rights. Further cases made no doubt continue that trend to hold that the right enjoyed by Runa Begum, is a civil right for purposes of Article 6 would, however, to be go further than the Strasbourg court has yet gone. And I'm satisfied that in the light of a compelling argument on this point by Mr Salesi, the Secretary of State, that the decision of this court would not many means necessarily be favourable to Runa Begum so I prefer to assume without deciding that Runa Begum's domestic law right is also a civil right and to consider whether on that assumption. But having regard to the nature of the right. The statutory provisions of an appeal to the county court on a point of law satisfies the requirements. Article 6 although the county court jurisdictions appellate's substance the same as that of the high Court in judicial review. Thus the court may not only quashed the authority's decision under 243, it's held to be officiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith, but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable, or if the decision maker is shown to have misunderstood or been ignorant of an established, in relevant fact,

In Bryan and other cases, my Lord fundamental for present purposes is the materiality of the distinction between on the one hand an administrative decision, which require the exercise by experts as a policy, banks discretion, not the present cases and on the other hand, decisions which as here turn on issues of simple primary fact and no more in the former category. Of course, judicial review or appeal on law only as that concept is conventionally understood will suffice. But not in the latter category. And my Lord we submit that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum comes within the former category, concerned as it was with suitability of accommodation. My Lord, Runa Begum is in volume 4 of the authorities a tab 20. The decision and early 2003. Okay. Yes, my Lord's first at page 438 of the appeal cases report for Runa Begum, paragraph to the parties were agreed that the appeal raised 3 questions which they express in this way was the review officer's decision on protection to to a determination of civil rights within the meaning of Article 61. If so, did she constitute an independent, impartial tribunal for the purposes of that article? If not, the county court on appeal under section 204 possess full jurisdiction so as to guarantee compliance with Article 6(1). And the second of these questions is answered in paragraph three, not independent. That's an integral feature of the scheme. Paragraph 4, one other question inherent in the first question also lends itself to a summary answer. Whether for the purposes of domestic law, Runa Begum enjoyed anything properly recognised as a right, the authorities suggested. No I cannot accept this. Section 1932 imposed a duty on the authority to secure that accommodation was available for her occupation. This was a duty owed to an enforceable by her, related to a matter of acute concern to her, although Section 26 permitted the authority to performance duty in one of several ways. And although performance calls for the exercise of judgement by the authorities, I think it plain that the authorities duty gave rise to a pluralative in Runa Begum , even though this was not a private law rights enforceable by injunction and damages. The first question differently expressed is whether Runa Begum's right recognised in domestic law, also a civil rights in the autonomous meaning given to that expression for purposes of one of the convention.

Looking at the scheme as a whole, it is not a scheme where there are simple questions of fact that lead to the end conclusion, like Minnetto or Tsfayo. And yes, there may be factual disputes in there. But that's part of the decision-making process, which requires the professional judgments. And then you look at the content of the dispute itself here. The alleged breach of Article six is that the reviewing officer is not independent. That is exactly the same as the argument in Runa Begum. It is in contrast to the argument in Tsfayo, but also to put it in the context of the case law. It's in contrast with a case like Wright where the court may remember that in Wright, the alleged breach of Article six or well the found breach of Article six was a complete denial of any right to make representations. So you, and the consequence of that decision, was that the person usually less lost their job, not always but on the fact that was very often going to be the result. So you've got a major departure from the principles of a fair trial, fair hearing combined with the very draconian consequence. Whereas here, you've got structural ind, lack of independence. But in terms of that breach and the consequences of that breach, nobody suggested the consequences aren't serious, but they're not in article six terms, the same as losing your job. Because of the. I'm sorry, I should explain that I'm getting into shorthand at this stage. Because that is such a clear attack on your private law rights. The consequence in Wright. You have a private contract of employment and that had to be terminated by statutory process if you were put on the provisional list. So that is an absolutely classic central civil right that has just been interfered with. Whereas here, we are on the absolute edge of a Part 7 right and whether they are Article six rights at all.

And if you simply stick in another application on the grounds that the decision-maker says they didn't get your letter, then my understanding of the case law is that you're likely to get fairly short shrift from the local authority. So my lords, conscious of the time, those are my submissions on breach. Can I then come finally to remedy? And the Secretary of State's position is that, if you're against me on everything that I've already said, then this is a case where it would be appropriate to exercise the powers in Section 3 rather than to make a Declaration of Incompatibility. And I don't think I actually need to take your Lordships and your Ladyship to the passage, guide and Volume 3 divider 14 paragraphs 30 to 33. You can read words in that change the meaning, but you can't adopt a meaning which is inconsistent with a fundamental part of the legislation. In my submission, reading section 204 to allow a right of appeal which extended to the consideration of facts. If that was what Article six required, would not be changing a fundamental part of the legislation. It would certainly be changing the meaning. And indeed, it would quite clearly be reversing what Parliament intended in 1996. But on my understanding of Gidan that is acceptable as long as it's fundamental to not fundamental to the legislation. Now, what I would say is that it would not on my learned friend, Mr. Goudie's submissions be at all easy to draft that new term of Section 3 as to precisely when this enhanced judicial review power would apply. But that doesn't mean you can't use Section 3. It merely shows the problems with my learned friend Mr's Goudie's arguments. Because if it was simply a question, every this has turned into a complete merits review under Section 204, and every issue could be considered in full that would be easy enough to draft.
