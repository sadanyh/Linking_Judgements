1	p1,01:07:51.530,01:09:03.400,spk_0,	True	Counsel: We've looked at already needed to be considered that on that basis, we submitted that the court had part, that there was a power of prorogation under Article 12 (3) that extended to all children in theory, wherever they are, wasn't confined to a sort of European ambit. That the requirements for interrogation in Article 12 were satisfied and we, and we also in our written case, although this wasn't developed an oral argument. We argued that following the decision of the European Court in the Owusu case, the principle of forum non conveniens did not apply in cases where the jurisdiction was based on Brussel's regulations. Alternatively, of course, we relied on Judge Banett's findings that this was the convenient forum. The Court of Appeal didn't go on to consider forum non conveniens because they determined that the court did not have jurisdiction.

1	p1,01:36:24.230,01:37:08.640,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Yes, that's right. The first question to be considered under Article 12 is whether the power to prorogue jurisdiction extends to children who are habitually resident in a state that is not a member state of the EU. The rationale for Article 12 is to provide an exception to the general rule. The jurisdiction matters of PR has converged on the member state of the child's habitual residence. Article 12, as well already identified provides two powers of propagation in matters of parental possibility. One in matrimonial, the other in non matrimonial proceedings. This case concerns a non matrimonial case.

1	p1,01:41:12.310,01:43:25.140,spk_0,	True	Counsel: No, it's not. But the point is that I succeed to make is that in those circumstances, under Article 3, there is an express reference to habitual residents. So where the child is not habitually resident in the member state, the court of that state shall have jurisdiction in such matters. If the child habitual resident in one of the member states and the test is satisfied, police are satisfied. Contrast Article 12, which of course, is headed prorogation, The courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction in divorce proceedings shall have jurisdiction in relation any matter where any parents really connected with that application, where and then the hurdles are inserted. So there is no reference, no restriction there to children who are habitually resident in one of the member states. [Pause]. And in our submission, there's no justification for reading into Article 12 (1). Or more importantly, for this case, Article 12 (3). The phrase in respect of a child who is habitually resident in a member state. I think this is a rhetorical point. If the authors had intended to limit the scope of the jurisdictional rules to cases where the trial was a fixture at the member state, given that they said so now in Brussels II we submit they surely would have done in Brussels II revised. The Court: Another way of putting that is that the commission must be presumed to be deliberate. Counsel: Yes, My Lord, and that first point --
1	p1,01:56:27.930,01:57:00.690,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Bottom of page 45 describing Article 12 (4) as described in Chapter two, Article 12 of regulation introduces a limited propagation option for a party to choose to seize a court of a member state in which the child is not habitually resident but with which the child is nevertheless a substantial connection. This option is not limited to situations where the child is habitually resident within the territory of a member state. But it applies also where the habitual residence of the child is in a third state that is not a contracting party to the 1996 Hague Convention.
1	p1,01:09:45.970,01:12:35.380,spk_0,	True	Counsel: On page 9 of the statement of issues I outlined the issues. These are these are agreed, although I will just mention this Brussel. But I remember agreement from her document. Obviously, we have a very quickly to get this this document. Broadly speaking, these are the issues that are raised before you. There are we raised the issues and we I put before the court we put before the court the issues under three headings the primacy of the Brussels II revised provision of jurisdiction, the scope and application of the provisions of Article 12 for Brussels II revised interrogation and the application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Now taking those in turn, I'm on page nine of my statement of facts document paragraph two. The first issue we raises is the primacy of the Brussels II revised provisions. That is not controversial as between the parties representatives before you. As you will see from Miss Russell's document, she accepts on behalf of her client our submissions to the privacy of the Brussels II revised provisions. But I will spend a little, not long, a little time just to lining our argument about that in due course, because of what follows from it. Secondly, we identify a number of matters arising under Article 12 free itself. And this is at the heart of the case. Paragraph 4. The first we mentioned the meaning of habitually resident. Now that point, strictly speaking, doesn't arise in this case because all parties are agreed. But whatever test is applied, Q is habitually resident in Pakistan and his parents are habitually resident in this country. Yeah, we, in other words, we're not seeking to float what would be a highly optimistic argument, that Q had retained to have had two official residences. We say the factual position is clear. However, we and it will be Mr Devereux who will be developing these arguments if called on by the court. We invite the court to consider whether it would be helpful and appropriate to consider issues of habitual residence and that arise in Brussel's law as it currently is.

1	p1,01:09:05.020,01:09:40.529,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The court rejected the submission that the prorogation powers under Article 12 (3) provisions extended to Children who were habitually resident outside the EU. The court held any event we didn't satisfy the hurdles for prorogation under Article 12 (3) and dismissed the appeal. Hence our appeal to this court and the -- that's all I propose to say about the facts or history of the case. At this stage, there may be other matters which we need to look at it.
1	p1,01:37:11.450,01:38:39.850,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The first issue arising is whether that power is confined as his contended on behalf of the father, to children who are habitually resident within the EU or extends to all children. As we contend. If that construction is correct, jurisdiction could be paraded to cover. Q. Provided the criteria Article 12 for you are satisfied before I turn to the question of third State. Could I just invite the court to look at Article 12 (3) and its predecessor. Article 12 (3), which you have open in front of you, reads, well, the first part of it reads, The courts of a member state should also have jurisdiction in relation to proceedings other than those referred to in paragraph 1. Now its predecessor was -- I realised I've also not in the course of the argument gone through the history of the Brussels regulations that is set out in full in my document, I assume, might even know that. 
1	p4,00:55:21.360,00:56:51.150,spk_1,	False	
1	p2,00:19:48.640,00:21:06.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Article 12 (3) of Brussels II Revised specifies three criteria for the prorogation of jurisdiction by courts of a Member State in matters of responsibility over a child, all of which have to be satisfied, namely, one, that the child has a substantial connection with that Member State. Article 12 (3) (a). Two that the jurisdiction of the court has been accepted expressly or otherwise, in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. Article 12 (3) (b). And three, the jurisdictions in the best interests of the child. Article 12 (3) (b) again. Now as far as the first criterion is concerned, Article 12 (3) (a), that is manifestly satisfied, and this is not contentious because under Article 12 (3) (a) itself specifically provides that a substantial connection will be established, in particular, by virtue of the fact that one of the holders of parental responsibility is habitually resident in that Member State or the child is a national of that Member State. In this case, both of those exemplar conditions are satisfied and consequently, as agreed by all parties, the child has a substantial connection with this country.

1	p3,00:27:59.680,00:30:29.540,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It seems, if I can elaborate what I'm saying at the moment, my Lord, I think it might explain what I'm trying to say about the incongruity of Article 12 being the only situation in which it would be considered apposite for parents to choose jurisdiction even if the child is not living within that jurisdiction and that is that part of the raison d'etre behind the regulation is the enforcement of judgments and the recognition of judgments. And if parents choose to deal with a country, whatever the country is be it Pakistan, be it United States of America, be it the Ukraine where the child lives, be it Jamaica. One can think of many countries that have very close connections with this country where children quite often live long term with extended family members, either after public law proceedings or within private law proceedings. And the parents choose this country or another country within the United -- Within the European Union to be the jurisdiction to hear the case, when it's patently obvious that the other court may not neither recognise the judgement nor enforce it. And how that supports the generality and the specific desire of this aim, I think is the proper term of the regulation, which is also set out in the guidance, it's hard to explain and I think is incongruent, because even if enforcement is not the main priority, it's certainly a priority, and for parents to be able to choose not to have a case heard where their child is living and nothing can be done about the result, whatever the result is, even if it's the right result in inverted commas, seems to be totally outside the aims of this regulation. And I'd ask you if you would --
1	p1,00:42:18.400,00:44:18.510,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And as recognised by the court itself, it is not possible to enforce any order for contact against those living in Pakistan. And then at Paragraph 28, he repeats -- well, Paragraph 22 he -- has a section headed, jurisdiction, on page five, recites in Paragraph 25, what he says the law is. Section 8, the jurisdictions based either on the Family Law Act 1986. I think there must be an, or, intended or the council regulation Brussels II revised. Paragraph 26, Given the child is in Pakistan, the council regulation is not applicable and the court needs to look at the physical present which residents have found jurisdiction. Q is not physically present in the jurisdiction and no party seems to suggest he's habitually resident. Habitually resident is not subject to time, its meaning is essentially based on the facts and looking at all the circumstances of the case. Its meaning is similar to ordinary resident requires appreciable period of time to live in a particular place. Pakistan is clearly his place of habitual residence. There is, however, case law which provides a basis for jurisdiction, namely, where there is an application to vary a Section 8 order value made in the UK, notwithstanding the child was neither habitually resident nor present in the UK, see Re S, in which the court had jurisdiction even though the child had moved to live in Holland since an order was made. The father accepts the court has retained jurisdiction to make orders directed towards himself in relation to contact. Difficulty, as any orders in relation to contact cannot be enforced. As Mr Justice Headley recognised, he could not compel anyone who lives in Pakistan to do anything.

2	p3,00:13:53.140,00:14:18.620,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I have to say that it's widely known. Yes. I mean, I'm involved in several such cases myself and it has happened. I've even heard them. I mean, it has happened and it does happen because there are so often fresh evidence arises for many reasons, including people changing their mind about the evidence they gave in the first place.

2	p1,00:10:54.040,00:11:17.270,spk_0,	True	Counsel: So, having made those further findings in December 2002, the care proceedings proceeded to a welfare hearing, as it's known, and the final hearing, that second stage of care proceedings took place on the 22nd of May. And on that occasion, the judge made a residence order in favour of the father.
2	p3,01:39:21.570,01:40:08.140,spk_6,	True	The Court: I'm very puzzled, because the father got the order for permission to remove the child on the basis of an undertaking to return the child to the jurisdiction when ordered to do so, and also made provision for interim of order -- Made for provision for interim contact with the mother. Counsel: Leading up to the accounts. The Court: Yes. So then the child goes abroad. I repeat my question. It may be that under English rules of procedure, you have to start anew. I'm surprised you do, but it seems that the mother has to start some new procedure. But looking at it broadly, they are the same proceedings, aren't they? Counsel: Yes they are. The Court: Absolutely. Counsel: Looking at it's broadest one couldn't argue otherwise it's the same child, it's the same parent.
2	p1,00:15:17.940,00:16:35.560,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It's the agreed position of the parties, namely the parents and the Guardian that Q has, is now, habitually resident in Pakistan whichever test is applied here. [Pause]. Since that date, he has lived in Pakistan, living with extended family, going to school in Pakistan. He has returned to this country on a number of occasions for contact with his mother. She's had some contact in Pakistan as well. But his home is in Pakistan. Now, the first application, and I'm now coming, I think, to the point raised by Lord Clarke. The first application made by the mother after that was on the 31st of October 2007. She was then acting in person, and it's right that the, that point should be borne in mind, as was the father at that stage and the order, the application that she made is, as one would expect of a litigant in person, I hope you forgive me, I don't intend to demean her by that phrase, it is not, perhaps in the couch from the terms which we would expect if a lawyer were involved. So if you look at in this appendix, part two Tab 27 you see the application that she made.

2	p1,00:42:18.400,00:44:18.510,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The father is not in a position to effect any order for Q to come to the UK and as recognised by the court itself, it is not possible to enforce any order for contact against those living in Pakistan. And then at Paragraph 28, he repeats -- well, Paragraph 22 he -- has a section headed, jurisdiction, on page five, recites in Paragraph 25, what he says the law is. Section 8, the jurisdictions based either on the Family Law Act 1986. I think there must be an, or, intended or the council regulation Brussels II revised. Paragraph 26, Given the child is in Pakistan, the council regulation is not applicable and the court needs to look at the physical present which residents have found jurisdiction.

2	p3,01:31:42.580,01:33:19.690,spk_3,	True	The Court: The Regulation clearly contemplates that there will be discrete pieces of litigation in relation to children, all the jurisdictional bits of the law accept that so that you can have one set of proceedings about children and then another set of proceedings about children. It's difficult. One can clearly distinguish the care proceedings, which were initiated by the local authority to which the local authority and the child were automatically parties, and which concluded with the making of the residents and supervision orders. Nobody would suggest that the local authority would automatically become a party to any subsequent application made to vary or substitute a new residents audit. So, one might suggest that that was a new set of proceedings. Query the father's application which related to the residence order. But obviously, again, I don't suppose he involved the local authority in making that application. I don't suppose he involved -- he wouldn't. Everybody, it is taken for granted, is it not? The guardian ad litem drops out of care proceedings when they are concluded and has to be reappointed if a further applications made within specified proceedings. That's one of the problems. And so the father's application, although we can argue about whether Section 13 is what it's under, is definitely for a Section 8 order basically and is a new set of proceedings, but is the mother's also a new set of proceedings?

3	p2,00:56:56.430,00:58:06.240,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Yes. Certainly as far as contracts -- why should I restrict it to contracts. But it's not restricted to contract, but to parental responsibility as a whole. And nor is it confined to the proceedings that would then extend 2004 proceedings. It's when ordered to do so by this court. And that's the context in which you consider the subsequent behaviour which in particular, those matters were summarised in paragraph 73. Now I fully accept that one has to be cautious about looking at these in isolation and perhaps particularly has to be cautious about acts of a litigant in person. But nonetheless, a litigant in person is a litigant, and he attended and participated at the hearing, what we call the conciliation hearing before the deputy district judge, which resulted in the detailed and defined contact order on the 12th of December 2007. He participated in the two day hearing before Mr Justice Headley, which resulted in the detailed defined contact order that we've seen earlier today.
3	p1,00:37:58.330,00:38:27.840,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Your Lordship will recall that the second, I'm going to call it, Home made. Application by the mother was to enforce and vary contact, plus other things. In other words, order made at the continuation hearing in front of District Judge Crowther in 2007. So it is a continuation of the proceedings that were started in 2007, as Lord Hope has reminded us. It has the same, bears the same number, and what happens thereafter is also a working out of what happened, of that order.

3	p1,00:27:34.820,00:33:51.980,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And then the order, to just go on to the order. The order requires the father to bring the child to the jurisdiction. For contact, the following year, this June, June for 8 weeks, June, July 2009 and provides the mother to have reasonable contact with the child either as agreed or as ordered by the court with reasonable telephone contact with a child in Pakistan and the mother is at liberty to visiting and contact the child in Pakistan. The father, having assured the court that she will be safe with his family and the judgement hopefully, in my hope, is immediately behind that, my tab eight in appendix part one. I don't know what tab number it is in court bundle. The next document is that Mr Justice Headley's judgment. Now, much of this judgment is deals with issues that arose because the judge was here in person and again, I don't propose to go through it in full unless the court wishes me to do so. But he recites the history, some of the evidence he'd heard he got the -- he asked the senior CAFCASS officer in the High Court Mr Miller, to attend to help see the parties and discuss matters. He recites what Mr Miller said to him. Paragraph 17 in the judgment and then paragraph 19 he says, I have no doubt that the court ought to give further consideration as to how this case is to be managed in the long term. It being incredibly obvious to me and not the party that trying to deal with the kind of time scale attempted this time around in such a court case merely underlines the difficulties that the court is inevitably confronted with. It is also my intention to crystallise out a statement of aspiration in paragraph five of the order the 12th December 2007 by directing the attendance of K, child in this jurisdiction in 2000 and nine on the basis that is apparently un contentious between the parties. And he may not be just a holiday but returned in case, in which case the court in every needs to be involved because they would be close to the future of contact can be considered.

I don't want to go through to go too much of the detail of this unless the court wishes to do so. The important point is that this is an application to effectively to enforce and vary the order that she got in December by agreement. That comes before district a district judge to then go to His Honour Judge Turner.

3	p3,02:26:01.110,02:27:19.280,spk_1,	True	Counsel: For my part, I think I would suggest 2007, in the sense that while I acknowledge, they are all proceedings in relation to the same child, to consider a number of applications in respect of one child that could take place over a significant period of time, all as one set of proceedings is, in my submission, something that could well be misleading. The initial orders back in 2003, of course, were a residence order, the order for the leave to remove from the jurisdiction. This is an application that the mother is making, asking the court, essentially, to survey fresh ground. And in my submission, it is, as a result, a separate set of proceedings. To use an example or to consider an example, if a relative, a grandmother, for the sake of argument, sought to make an application in respect of the same child, that would be viewed, one might consider, as a separate set of proceedings. A different party. But yet it's still a Section 8 application in respect of the same child. So, on balance, I think my view would be that I would see these proceedings as separate from the earlier proceedings, and starting in 2007.
3	p1,00:15:17.940,00:16:35.560,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It's the agreed position of the parties, namely the parents and the Guardian that Q has, is now, habitually resident in Pakistan whichever test is applied here. [Pause]. Since that date, he has lived in Pakistan, living with extended family, going to school in Pakistan. He has returned to this country on a number of occasions for contact with his mother. She's had some contact in Pakistan as well. But his home is in Pakistan. Now, the first application, and I'm now coming, I think, to the point raised by Lord Clarke. The first application made by the mother after that was on the 31st of October 2007. She was then acting in person, and it's right that the, that point should be borne in mind, as was the father at that stage and the order, the application that she made is, as one would expect of a litigant in person, I hope you forgive me, I don't intend to demean her by that phrase, it is not, perhaps in the couch from the terms which we would expect if a lawyer were involved. So if you look at in this appendix, part two Tab 27 you see the application that she made.
4	p1,01:04:04.790,01:06:48.220,spk_0,	True	Counsel: That's right. That is the hierarchical. We'll look at the detail of the hierarchy is still that very clearly in the practise guide, which will come into in a moment. Now just to go on, then, with the story, the history. In the course of that argument, the judge asked for further submissions on the issue of forum non conveniens. In other words, were he to decide that the court had jurisdiction, as argued for on behalf of the mother, he wanted them to consider and have helped as to whether or not he should grant a stay on the grounds of forum non conveniens to stay of the proceedings and arguments were addressed on that on the next day. And on that on that point, mother of course contended that these courts were convenient forum and the guardian's position is interesting. She had he season he had opposed, he had argued against the jurisdictional part, in other words, holding, submitting that the court did not have jurisdiction. But if he was wrong about that, he argued that it was a convenient forum. Yeah, Judge Barnes judgement was handed down on the 28th of May and he held that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the applications. However, he further held that if there was application to entertain -- sorry, jurisdiction to entertain the applications, he would have refused to grant a stay of the applications on the ground and formed opinions. I mentioned that because I think Lord Justice thought with great respect, has erred in paragraph nine of his judgement when he says, if you look at the appealed judgement, which is tab two it's immediately, it's in your core, your Lordship, Courts copy. It's in the core, a whole bundle, she says in paragraph nine, He's corrected Lord Justice I have re read his judgement I assure the court. But that's not what he said when he was giving it extra.

4	p1,00:42:18.400,00:44:18.510,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The father is not in a position to effect any order for Q to come to the UK and as recognised by the court itself, it is not possible to enforce any order for contact against those living in Pakistan. And then at Paragraph 28, he repeats -- well, Paragraph 22 he -- has a section headed, jurisdiction, on page five, recites in Paragraph 25, what he says the law is. Section 8, the jurisdictions based either on the Family Law Act 1986. I think there must be an, or, intended or the council regulation Brussels II revised. Paragraph 26, Given the child is in Pakistan, the council regulation is not applicable and the court needs to look at the physical present which residents have found jurisdiction. Q is not physically present in the jurisdiction and no party seems to suggest he's habitually resident. Habitually resident is not subject to time, its meaning is essentially based on the facts and looking at all the circumstances of the case. Its meaning is similar to ordinary resident requires appreciable period of time to live in a particular place. Pakistan is clearly his place of habitual residence. There is, however, case law which provides a basis for jurisdiction, namely, where there is an application to vary a Section 8 order value made in the UK, notwithstanding the child was neither habitually resident nor present in the UK, see Re S, in which the court had jurisdiction even though the child had moved to live in Holland since an order was made. The father accepts the court has retained jurisdiction to make orders directed towards himself in relation to contact. Difficulty, as any orders in relation to contact cannot be enforced. As Mr Justice Headley recognised, he could not compel anyone who lives in Pakistan to do anything.

Now that, and he then goes on two make to decide that it's impractical for the child to be brought to the country in 2008. Father agreed between the child in 2009 didn't agree in 2008. Mr Justice Hedley ruled that it was impractical for him to make an order at that date a 20th of June for that to happen.

4	p3,02:01:45.110,02:04:18.650,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Can I at the outset say that there was some discussion yesterday morning about the appointment of the guardian and the appointment of the child as a party. And there was, as I recall, a request perhaps to have sight of Rule 9.5. Lords I have brought copies of that today if they may assist together with a copy of the practise direction from April 2004. You will see in 9.5 paragraph one that it is open to the court if it is in the court's view in the best interests of any child to be made a party to the proceedings to go on and appoint sub paragraph A an officer of the service or a Welsh family proceedings officer, and that would refer in my submission to CAFCASS and that is indeed what happened in this case. My Lords in paragraph five 9.55 it is clear that that person who is appointed is then to be treated as a party for the purpose of those proceedings. Lords the attached practise direction is of relevance in this way, in the sense that at paragraph three it sets out some guidance in respect of the decision to make the child a party. And it refers at paragraph 3.7 to circumstances which I would say called to this case so that where there are international complications outside child abduction, in particular where it may be necessary if they're to be discussions with overseas authorities or a foreign court. So my Lords in my submission, while I acknowledge that it is unusual in many private law proceedings to have the child joined as a party as was indicated yesterday, in cases of this type where you have got non abduction international complications it may well be that it is a more likely occurrence than not.
4	p1,00:54:49.620,00:55:28.610,spk_0,	True	Counsel: So the matter -- the argument was at that stage that the court had jurisdiction under the residual domestic rules. Mother argued that it did. Father argued that it did not. There wasn't an ongoing variation that the order -- that there was a fresh application following the fresh application we made following the child's removal to Pakistan and that in those circumstances the court had lost jurisdiction because the habitual residence requirement can no longer be satisfied. In addition, in the course of that argument, the judge --
4	p2,01:11:14.660,01:12:29.440,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: At every time. And of course it is, My Lord Clarke was quite right to remind me, the jurisdiction of the courts. The jurisdiction is in the best interests of the child. But that is very close to asking the welfare question, and it cannot be right in my submission at all points for the court to consider the welfare question in order to determine whether it has jurisdiction, since the point of establishing jurisdiction is to carry out the welfare exercise. In this case, of course, we're dealing with a country that isn't Pakistan that is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, and consequently, 12 (4) comes into play, and here we move into an element of some uncharted waters, an interpretation which we put forward without authority for discussion. This contains a deeming provision, where the child has habitual residence in the territory of a third state, which is not a contracting party of the Hague Convention, jurisdiction under this Article shall be deemed to be in the child's interest.
4	p1,00:02:35.840,00:03:58.090,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The court will be aware that this is an appeal against an order of the Court of Appeal dated the 21st of July. Dismissing an appeal against the decision of his honour Judge Barlett, sitting as a judge of the family division whereby he held the court did not have jurisdiction to entertain applications under the Children Act for orders assessing and defining contact between our client, the mother and the parties' only child, Q, who is now aged nine years of age. Permission was granted -- it was refused to appear, permission to appear was refused by the Court of Appeal but granted by this court, I think on the 28th of September. Could I just my Lord mention one or two preliminary matters? First of all, we are extremely grateful to the court for accommodating this case, this appeal so quickly. Of course, as a children's case, it is a matter of some urgency. I hope the Lord will permit me just in particular, thank the court staff particularly I name Mrs Demanbro for the assistance that they particularly she have given us over the last few weeks in the unusual circumstances in which we found ourselves. And it's a credit to the court that they were able to provide that assistance despite or the other demand on their time in the last few weeks.
4	p3,01:39:21.570,01:40:08.140,spk_6,	True	The Court: I'm very puzzled, because the father got the order for permission to remove the child on the basis of an undertaking to return the child to the jurisdiction when ordered to do so, and also made provision for interim of order -- made for provision for interim contact with the mother. Counsel: Leading up to the accounts. The Court: Yes. So then the child goes abroad. I repeat my question. It may be that under English rules of procedure, you have to start anew. I'm surprised you do, but it seems that the mother has to start some new procedure. But looking at it broadly, they are the same proceedings, aren't they? Counsel: Yes they are. The Court: Absolutely. Counsel: Looking at it's broadest one couldn't argue otherwise it's the same child, it's the same parent.
4	p1,00:48:26.700,00:49:05.200,spk_0,	True	Counsel: He seeks to set aside or discharge the order requiring him to bring the child to the jurisdiction that summer, effectively. So he is seeking -- he invoked the jurisdiction of the court to vary the order made by Mr Justice Headley the previous year, and the reason he does so is set out at paragraph five for the reasons set out in the applicants position statement in this matter which we just looked at, [inaudible] but that's the document, the applicant contends that it is no longer in the child's best interest or necessarily practically possible for the child to be brought to the UK this summer.
4	p3,02:06:16.580,02:09:36.860,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Of course, the order of Mrs -- Mr Justice Headley had provided for the children's representatives to restore the matter back before the court once the guardian had had time to make some preliminary inquiries. The report was therefore prepared and the matter then, of course, as we know, brought back before the court in the early part of this year. But more to the relevance of that report in my submission is perhaps that at Page 13 it seems that the guardian was the first person, certainly the first party, to seemingly apply his mind to the jurisdiction of the court. He has consistently since that time flagged up with the court his concerns about the jurisdiction. Lords, a position statement filed on his behalf in February was very clear that one of the first questions that the court should be asked to consider was the question of jurisdiction. And that position statement is at Tab 18 again of Appendix 2 as I understand it. The Court: Yes. Counsel: So, it would seem to be clear on the face of the papers that the guardian has consistently raised this concern. He has been seeking the guidance of the court on the matter, and he has sought the guidance of the child's solicitor. He himself was not expressing a personal view, and to some degree, that remains, in terms of the question of jurisdiction, his position. At the hearing in May, before his Honour, Judge Barnett, the child's solicitor argued on his behalf on legal grounds that the court did not have jurisdiction. But My Lords will, of course, have seen that in fact, when it came to arguments of forum non conveniens the guardian, in fact, preferred that the matter be dealt with in this jurisdiction. From that point on, the guardian has taken the view that he was content with that decision of his Honour, Judge Barnett. So, took essentially a neutral stance in the Court of Appeal. He didn't seek to go behind that decision, and the position today is essentially that because he doesn't seek to go behind those decisions, he essentially resists the appeal. But it isn't perhaps at first blush, the most straightforward position.
4	p1,00:41:43.810,00:42:16.920,spk_0,	True	Counsel: He says on the first page, paragraph 4(a), the court has retained jurisdiction in this case, and the father accepts the court's jurisdiction. However, given that the child is habitually resident in Pakistan and he's living there permanently in the day to day care of his paternal aunt and grandparents, the father is not in the position to affect any order for Q to come to the UK.
4	p2,01:06:55.150,01:07:09.570,Judge,	True	The Court: That could arise in the case of an express acceptance. You could say, Sorry, I agreed to this, but I was completely misled and ask for that agreement, that express agreement, to be set aside. So there has to be that modification of the thing it's not so tight it doesn't accept that kind of error.
4	p3,00:13:53.140,00:14:18.620,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I have to say that it's widely known. Yes. I mean, I'm involved in several such cases myself and it has happened. I've even heard them. I mean, it has happened and it does happen because there are so often fresh evidence arises for many reasons, including people changing their mind about the evidence they gave in the first place.

4	p1,00:49:06.410,00:50:07.460,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The reason he does so is set out at paragraph 5, For the reason set out in the applicant's position statement, well we haven't looked at all of it. But it's that's the document. The applicant contends that it is no longer in the child's best interests or necessarily practically possible for the child to be brought to the UK this summer. Necessarily practically possible. Now the matter then comes down for comes before Mrs Justice Black on the 12th of March. And she sets it down for hearing on the 5th of May. In the course of that hearing, we understand, I don't think any of counsel present now were instructed at that point. In the course of that hearing, Mrs Justice Black raised the question of whether the court had jurisdiction to make orders in respect of Q. And thus the matter comes before his honour Judge Barnett, sitting as a deputy judge of the division on the 5th and 6th of May, and Mr Deveraux was then instructed [crosstalk] --.
4	p1,00:27:34.820,00:33:51.980,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And then the order, to just go on to the order. The order requires the father to bring the child to the jurisdiction. For contact, the following year, this June, June for 8 weeks, June, July 2009 and provides the mother to have reasonable contact with the child either as agreed or as ordered by the court with reasonable telephone contact with a child in Pakistan and the mother is at liberty to visiting and contact the child in Pakistan. The father, having assured the court that she will be safe with his family and the judgement hopefully, in my hope, is immediately behind that, my tab eight in appendix part one. I don't know what tab number it is in court bundle. The next document is that Mr Justice Headley's judgment. Now, much of this judgment is deals with issues that arose because the judge was here in person and again, I don't propose to go through it in full unless the court wishes me to do so. But he recites the history, some of the evidence he'd heard he got the -- he asked the senior CAFCASS officer in the High Court Mr Miller, to attend to help see the parties and discuss matters. He recites what Mr Miller said to him. Paragraph 17 in the judgment and then paragraph 19 he says, I have no doubt that the court ought to give further consideration as to how this case is to be managed in the long term. It being incredibly obvious to me and not the party that trying to deal with the kind of time scale attempted this time around in such a court case merely underlines the difficulties that the court is inevitably confronted with. It is also my intention to crystallise out a statement of aspiration in paragraph five of the order the 12th December 2007 by directing the attendance of K, child in this jurisdiction in 2000 and nine on the basis that is apparently un contentious between the parties. And he may not be just a holiday but returned in case, in which case the court in every needs to be involved because they would be close to the future of contact can be considered. The mothers receive an assurance from the London borough of Newham they would undertake an assessment of their capacity to have unsupervised contact, which must be her first aspiration. If that is granted, where it will lead is, of course, a matter that stretches sufficiently far in the future to be very unwise for this court to make any comment about now. And that is an assessment to which, of course you must be entitled and is in a sense, which is of course futile without the presence of the child, or at least it could be started. But it cannot be completed without the presence of the stuff -- of the child. So those are matters about which I have no doubt which I will do course reduced in due course, reduce into order form that there needs the issue about this summer I contact in summer 2008, upon which, as upon many issues, the parties remained hopelessly divided. The judge recites parties arguments Paragraph 24, 25, 26. Now I do not, for one moment underestimate the importance of this matter to the perils. On the face of it, the mother makes a perfectly reasonable application. On the face of it, the father raises not unreasonable objections to visit taking place this summer. One simply has to recognise that this is so, one also has to acknowledge that is generally desirable strongly in the interests of a child to maintain a proper relationship with both his parents, both of whom, of course, at this stage live in the United Kingdom, which he does not. And so one recognises that in the ordinary circumstances, it is perfectly reasonable that matters should take place as contemplated. There's nothing ordinary about this case at all. The relationships are vindictive, the willingness to discuss is wholly absent nobody's able to speak without making any allegations against each other, and the whole thing is hopelessly fraught. That of course immediately to ask myself, What on earth is that I'm bringing this child into if I were to require to return? And I fear that what happened last time he was here and there was an issue about what happened to him, which I won't go into whichever account one chooses to look at, whether the mother or father does nothing but add to the concerns, then he makes further comments about the parents. And then he goes on Paragraph 29. I have, of course, no power, whatever to compel anyone in Pakistan to do anything. The only power I have is to compel the mother or the father by reason of their being parents and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the court. No one else is because, of course, the child is entirely lawfully in Pakistan. And indeed it is unusual that the court should be retaining jurisdiction in this case because, of course, the child is habitually resident in Pakistan and were this a European case the court would be positively deprived of jurisdiction by the structure of European parenting law, but it is not, and the court undoubtedly does have jurisdiction because both parties have not only submitted to the jurisdiction but have actually invoked it on a number of occasions. And so the question of jurisdiction of itself does not present a problem in this case, though, of course, the question of enforcement of orders might. I've considered the implications of that paragraph on a number of occasions of recent months, and were I to remove the two references to European, then there will be no difficulty. We'll come back onto the -- come back to the interpretation, if I may, a little later. But the point I want to emphasise is that the learned judge relied in his recent conclusion, the court undoubtedly does have jurisdiction on the fact the parties have not only submitted to the jurisdiction, but had actually invoked it on a number of occasions.

I was then instructed the argument for the Court of Appeal was framed very differently. We put forward the Brussels II revised arguments, which we now advance before this court. We argued that the jurisdictional question fell first to be considered under Brussels II revised. Otherwise, the hierarchical order, as we've looked at already, needed to be considered.

But I remember agreement from her document. Obviously, we have a very quickly to get this this document. Broadly speaking, these are the issues that are raised before you. There are we raised the issues and we I put before the court we put before the court the issues under three headings the primacy of the Brussels II revised provision of jurisdiction, the scope and application of the provisions of Article 12 for Brussels II revised interrogation and the application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Now taking those in turn, I'm on page nine of my statement of facts document paragraph two. The first issue we raises is the primacy of the Brussels II revised provisions. That is not controversial as between the parties representatives before you. As you will see from Miss Russell's document, she accepts on behalf of her client our submissions to the privacy of the Brussels II revised provisions. But I will spend a little, not long, a little time just to lining our argument about that in due course, because of what follows from it. Secondly, we identify a number of matters arising under Article 12 free itself. And this is at the heart of the case. Paragraph 4. The first we mentioned the meaning of habitually resident. Now that point, strictly speaking, doesn't arise in this case because all parties are agreed. But whatever test is applied, Q is habitually resident in Pakistan and his parents are habitually resident in this country. Yeah, we, in other words, we're not seeking to float what would be a highly optimistic argument, that Q had retained to have had two official residences. We say the factual position is clear. However, we and it will be Mr Devereux who will be developing these arguments if called on by the court. We invite the court to consider whether it would be helpful and appropriate to consider issues of habitual residence and that arise in Brussel's law as it currently is.

And the comparison I wish to draw is, in fact, between the old article 3 under Brussels II and in fact, strictly, it's the matrimonial jurisdiction, Article 12 (1). Because, of course, there was no equivalent to Article 12 (3) in the Brussels II regulations. So if I could invite the court to have Brussels II at tab six, Article 3(1) and Brussels II revised Article 12(1), run open and compare the two. So tab 1 and tab 6 Brussels II Article 3(1) says the courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction by virtue of article to an application for divorce and legal separation of marriage annulment shall have jurisdiction in respect, in respect of matters, respect a matter of principle, overcharging both prizes where the child is habitually resident in that member state to where the child is not a bit she resident in the member state referred to in paragraph one. Yeah, the court of that state shall have jurisdiction shut a matter if the child is in which the present in one of the member states and and then the two tests are set out. At least one of the spouses has PR, and the jurisdiction has been accepted by the spouses and is in the best interests of the child.

Of course, the other point to make is that Article 8 and 9 of the Hague Convention contain a power which anticipates Article 15 of Brussels II. Article 15 is the provision Brussels II Revised. Article 15 of the Brussels II revised is the provisions which provides for consensual transfer between Member States. And there are similar provisions as between contracting states in Articles 8 and 9 of the Hague Convention.
5	p1,00:58:10.620,01:00:10.740,spk_0,	True	The Court: Yes. Counsel: If you look at tab -- just to try and make it less unclear. Tab 10 contains the version of the Family Law Act 1986. It was enforced before the 2005 amendment, which was implemented to take account of Brussels II revised, as we will go on to consider later. And the court knows, Brussels II revised is the successor to an early regulation Brussels II, and this previous version of the Family Law Act 1986 was had itself been amended with itself is out of an earlier amendment to take account of the earlier regulation. So when, when we see paragraph two on page four of the document, tab 10, Section 2 reads, then read as follows, that is immediately prior to April 2005, A court in England and Wales shall not have jurisdiction to make a Section 1 (1)(a) order with respect to a child in or in connection with matrimonial proceedings in England and Wales. Unless, a, a child concerned is the child of both parties to the matrimonial proceedings and the court has jurisdiction to entertain these proceedings by virtue of the council regulation, which, of course, is Brussels II. Or, b, the condition in Section 2 A of this Act satisfied. A court in England and Wales shall only have jurisdiction to make a Section 1 (1)(a) order in a non matrimonial case, that is to say, where the condition in Section 2(a) of the act is not satisfied unless the condition in Section 3 of this act is satisfied. And the reason for that distinction at that stage was Brussels II it was a regulation dealing with matrimonial cases and only covered issues of power and responsibility that arose in the context of such matrimonial proceedings, so.
5	p1,00:51:26.660,00:53:39.870,spk_0,	True	Counsel: We've got a trial run, Westlaw trial in our chambers at the moment so we're using it formally, although whether it's helpful to have it this way, I don't know but that's the way it's set out. A court in England and Wales shall not make a section 1(1)(a) order. Does the court wish me to deal with what that is? I'll come back to that. A section 1(1)(a) order with respect to a child unless, A) it has jurisdiction under the council regulation or, B) the council regulation does not apply, but 1) the question of making the order arise in connection with matrimonial proceedings or civil partnership proceedings and the condition in section 2 (a) of this act is satisfied or 2) the condition in section 3 of this act is satisfied. Section 2(a) at the bottom of the page that page three the condition referred to in section 2(1) of this act is that the procedures are proceedings in respect of a marriage, or a civil partnership of the parents of the child concerned and A) the procedures are for proceedings for divorce or nullity, or dissolution or annulment of civil partnership and are continuing B) these are proceedings for separation and are continuing. And the jurisdiction, of the court is not excluded by subsection 2 below. I won't read on my Lord, because Section 2(a) did not and does not apply well, never, we say it never applies, and it wasn't argued before Judge Barnett. Section 3, perpetual residence or presence of the child. The condition referred to in section 2 (1)(b)(2) of this act is that on the relevant date, the child concerned A) is a resident in England and Wales or B) is present in England and Wales and is not habitually resident in any part of the United Kingdom. And in either case, the jurisdiction of the Court is not excluded by subsection 2 below and subsection 2 excludes jurisdiction if proceedings are continuing in other courts in the United Kingdom.

As we contend. If that construction is correct, jurisdiction could be [inaudible] to cover Q. Provided the criteria Article 12 for you are satisfied before I turn to the question of third State. Could I just invite the court to look at Article 12 (3) and its predecessor. Article 12 (3), which you have open in front of you, reads, well, the first part of it reads, The courts of a member state should also have jurisdiction in relation to proceedings other than those referred to in paragraph 1. Now its predecessor was -- I realised I've also not in the course of the argument gone through the history of the Brussels regulations, that is set out in full in my document, I assume I needn't do that.

A court in England and Wales shall only have jurisdiction to make a Section 1 (1)(a) order in a non matrimonial case, that is to say, where the condition in Section 2(a) of the act is not satisfied unless the condition in Section 3 of this act is satisfied. And the reason for that distinction at that stage was Brussels II it was a regulation dealing with matrimonial cases and only covered issues of power and responsibility that arose in the context of such matrimonial proceedings, so.

6	p3,01:26:18.710,01:27:02.500,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I think if My Lords decide that Brussels II does apply to cases where children are not resident in this country, people will be quite quick to develop such a way of dealing with the case. But we're not dealing with that here. We're dealing with the situation where that kind of provision wasn't made and where I say that the first respondent cannot have been said whether he attended at court and spoke to the conciliator and the order was made by conciliation. And of course, My Lords and My Lady will be very well aware that at conciliation appointments the orders can only be made if by consent.
6	p1,01:09:45.970,01:12:35.380,spk_0,	True	Counsel: On page 9 of the statement of issues I outlined the issues. These are these are agreed, although I will just mention this Brussel. But I remember agreement from her document. Obviously, we have a very quickly to get this this document. Broadly speaking, these are the issues that are raised before you. There are we raised the issues and we I put before the court we put before the court the issues under three headings the primacy of the Brussels II revised provision of jurisdiction, the scope and application of the provisions of Article 12 for Brussels II revised interrogation and the application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Now taking those in turn, I'm on page nine of my statement of facts document paragraph two. The first issue we raises is the primacy of the Brussels II revised provisions. That is not controversial as between the parties representatives before you. As you will see from Miss Russell's document, she accepts on behalf of her client our submissions to the privacy of the Brussels II revised provisions. But I will spend a little, not long, a little time just to lining our argument about that in due course, because of what follows from it. Secondly, we identify a number of matters arising under Article 12 free itself. And this is at the heart of the case. Paragraph 4. The first we mentioned the meaning of habitually resident. Now that point, strictly speaking, doesn't arise in this case because all parties are agreed. But whatever test is applied, Q is habitually resident in Pakistan and his parents are habitually resident in this country. Yeah, we, in other words, we're not seeking to float what would be a highly optimistic argument, that Q had retained to have had two official residences. We say the factual position is clear. However, we and it will be Mr Devereux who will be developing these arguments if called on by the court. We invite the court to consider whether it would be helpful and appropriate to consider issues of habitual residence and that arise in Brussel's law as it currently is.

6	p2,00:10:06.940,00:10:18.890,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Now, Dr Borrás' commentary about this is quite interesting, at tab 9 in the same bundle. This is Dr Borrás' report, in case it is not clear, is the explanatory report prepared for the Convention, we jumped ahead of this this morning, but before initially, the plan was that the new EU rules and procedures about jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of matrimonial cases, was to be the subject of a convention rather than a regulation. But in the event, the draft convention was converted into a regulation. I'm sure I use inelegant and inaccurate language, but that's what happened. This report is an explanatory report for the convention that became the regulation, Brussels II, Dr Borrás'. And can I ask you, please, turn to page 12 and 13, and beginning at paragraph 35 you see a heading, parental responsibility. Paragraph 35 simply recites paraphrases Article 3 of Brussels II. And then she says this, paragraph 36. The structure and content of this provision are the product of difficult negotiation, both within the community and in relation to worldwide provisions, particularly the 1996 Hague Convention. The fact that the community Convention limits itself to children habitually resident in the Member State facilitates its compatibility with the Hague Convention. The agreement between the Member States to include this matter within the scope of the Convention simply transferred the problem to the establishment of grounds for jurisdiction. Since while there were no problems where the child is habitually resident in the State as authorities have jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings, the same does not apply to cases where the child is habitually resident in another Member State. The problem is further complicated by the fact that Article 52 (2) of the Hague Convention provides that the Convention does not affect the possibility of one or more contracting States to conclude agreements which contain, in respect of children habitually resident in any of the States parties to such agreements, provisions on matters governed by that Convention. As a result, where both Conventions are in force -- remember, by both Conventions, she means Hague and the anticipated Brussels Convention. The Convention to which this report relates will take precedence in respect of children resident in Member States of the EU which are party to it. Whereas the Hague Convention will apply to other cases. There are no problems in relation to Article 3 (1), which establishes jurisdiction in the matter relating to parental responsibility over a child of both spouses where the child is habitually resident in the Member State, whose authorities also exercise jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings. It needs to be made clear that in no case does that provision mean that it must be the same authority in the State concerned to rule on the matrimonial and the parental responsibility. The rule is intended not only to establish that the authorities deciding on both matters are authorities of the same State. In practise, they will be the same authorities in some States and separate authorities in others. For the purpose of the Convention, the only point of interest is that they'd be authorities of the same Member State with due regard for internal distribution of competence. Paragraph 2 sets out the conditions under which the authorities of the Member State exercising jurisdiction on the divorce also have jurisdiction to decide parental responsibility, where the child is resident, not in that State but in another Member State. Both the following conditions have to be met. At least one of the spouses must have responsibility in relation to the child, and the jurisdiction of the courts must be accepted by the spouses and must be in the best interests of the child. This provision is taken from Article 10 (1) of the 1996 Hague Convention, which guarantees that there is no contradiction between Article 3 (2) of the Convention under discussion and the relevant provisions of the Hague Convention. The relevant provision of the Hague convention is practically the same thing, the only difference being that, in addition to requiring that one of the parents has responsibility, it also requires that at the time of the commencement proceedings, one of the parents habitually resides in that state. The difference derives from the differing subject matters of the two Conventions. The Hague Convention deals with the protection of children, whereas the Convention to which this report relates deals in matrimonial matters and for that reason the parents connection with the territory of a State for the purpose of determining jurisdiction in matrimonial matters is determined by the grounds set out in Article 2. Article 3 (2) is designed to cover one particular situation in which the best solution is to use the same grounds of the Hague Convention. So the important point is that, according to Dr Borrás, the terms of the original Brussels II regulation in this regard, were effectively designed to facilitate compatibility with the Hague Convention.

6	p2,00:15:01.540,00:15:52.060,Judge,	True	The Court: Well, isn't the effect of Article 52 of the Hague Convention that where the two competing States are subject to another international instrument, which I think for this purpose would include the Brussels II regulation, it's that other instrument which prevails, and that is the same solution as in Article 61. So that's dealing with two member states, one of whom may be subject, or both of whom may be subject to the Hague Convention. The Brussels II revised trumps anything in the Hague Convention. And then that would then make sense of 12 (4) telling you what relevance the Hague Convention might have when it's a non Member State.
7	p2,00:19:48.640,00:21:06.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Article 12 (3) of Brussels II Revised specifies three criteria for the prorogation of jurisdiction by courts of a Member State in matters of responsibility over a child, all of which have to be satisfied, namely, one, that the child has a substantial connection with that Member State. Article 12 (3) (a). Two that the jurisdiction of the court has been accepted expressly or otherwise, in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. Article 12 (3) (b). And three, the jurisdictions in the best interests of the child. Article 12 (3) (b) again. Now as far as the first criterion is concerned, Article 12 (3) (a), that is manifestly satisfied, and this is not contentious because under Article 12 (3) (a) itself specifically provides that a substantial connection will be established, in particular, by virtue of the fact that one of the holders of parental responsibility is habitually resident in that Member State or the child is a national of that Member State. In this case, both of those exemplar conditions are satisfied and consequently, as agreed by all parties, the child has a substantial connection with this country.

7	p2,00:06:51.280,00:07:49.450,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Well, it does, there are issues of comity, which Miss Russell relies on, and they are recognised in some of the academic discussion. But in my submission to the court, is the meaning is absolutely clear. It is arguable whether it is from the competence of the EU to have done what it's done. But it has done it. In my submission, it is absolutely clear. I wanted to go back to try to just explore, without having the answers, I'm afraid, My Lord, the interconnection between 1996 Convention and that again involves looking at Dr Borrás' report in 1998 and having the Hague Convention and the regulation opened. The Hague Convention is at tab 4, isn't it, in volume 1 and, Article 10 on the third page, provides an equivalent to the article, the non revised original Brussels II provision. In other words, a prorogation in respect of a child habitually resident in another contracting State. So without prejudice to the previous articles which established the basic jurisdictional rules, the authorities of a contracting State under the Hague Convention exercising jurisdiction decide upon an application for divorce or legal separation of the parents of a child habitually resident in another contracting State or for annulment of their marriage may, if the law of the State so provides, take measures directed to the protection of the personal property of such child if at the time of commencement of the proceedings, one of his or her parents habitually resides in that State and one of them has parental responsibility in relation to the child and (b), the jurisdiction of these authorities to take such measures has been accepted by the parents as well as by any other person who has parental responsibility in relation to the child and is in the best interests of the child. And then the jurisdiction ceases, you will see the similar terms. If we compare that with Brussels, we already looked at Brussels, the original Brussels II at tab 6, you'll remember that is in very similar terms to the Article 3 (2).
7	p2,00:05:46.340,00:06:48.000,Judge,	True	The Court: There's no one who knows more about this than Professor Alegria Borrás. She says another rule related to the 1996 Hague convention is paragraph 4 of Article 12, which aims to solve what I have always considered an artificial problem. The objective of the rule is to clarify that Article 52, I think that is of the Hague Convention, doesn't affect children who do not hold habitual residence in a State party to the convention, which is obvious. However, the solution for those cases is somewhat strange because after having clarified that The Hague convention does not apply, it then adds that it will be presumed that jurisdiction under that Article is in the interest of the child, a disposition which has been qualified as an excessive exercise of community terrorisation of judicial jurisdiction related to the supposed interest of the child, then citing some other Spanish material.
7	p1,01:41:12.310,01:43:25.140,spk_0,	True	Counsel: No, it's not. But the point is that I succeed to make is that in those circumstances, under Article 3, there is an express reference to habitual residents. So where the child is not habitually resident in the member state, the court of that state shall have jurisdiction in such matters. If the child habitual resident in one of the member states and the test is satisfied, police are satisfied. Contrast Article 12, which of course, is headed prorogation, The courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction in divorce proceedings shall have jurisdiction in relation any matter where any parents really connected with that application, where and then the hurdles are inserted. So there is no reference, no restriction there to children who are habitually resident in one of the member states. [Pause]. And in our submission, there's no justification for reading into Article 12 (1). Or more importantly, for this case, Article 12 (3). The phrase in respect of a child who is habitually resident in a member state. I think this is a rhetorical point. If the authors had intended to limit the scope of the jurisdictional rules to cases where the trial was a fixture at the member state, given that they said so now in Brussels II we submit they surely would have done in Brussels II revised. The Court: Another way of putting that is that the commission must be presumed to be deliberate. Counsel: Yes, My Lord, and that first point --
7	p2,01:40:10.810,01:40:59.370,Respondent ,	True	Counsel: And it is within that context that they are described as third states. And I've set out, I think, briefly in our case, some of the reasons why we say that. But if we look at the regulations themselves regarding the two points where third state is mentioned and also looking again at the Articles referring to third states, the first one is, of course, and the first mention is at 12 (4), and you could say that the meaning there is where the child has his or her habitual residence in the territory or the state which is not a contracting party to the Hague Convention, then the indication is that it is presumed to be in the child's interest, particularly if it's not possible to hold proceedings in that member state to hold proceedings in the state that the parties have agreed upon. And I will return to the matter of agreement later. If one also considers Article 61, which deals with relations with the Hague Convention of October 1996, at (b) of that particular Article, it refers to the recognition and enforcement of the judgment given at the court of the Member State and at the territory of another Member State, even if the child concerned has his or her habitual residence on the territory of a third state, which is a contracting party to the convention. And then we would say that the question of the definition of third state has to be seen within the context of the convention as a whole. And when one considers the convention as a whole, the preamble and the guidance, which I will again return to, it's clear the objective is to create an area within the community itself to allow freedom of movement of persons, including to adopt the judicial cooperation in civil matters and the proper functioning of the internal market. So that is the context of this. And Lord Collins referred to the fact that third state could be seen, perhaps in the same way that one might refer to a third party. But if one looks at the council regulation in that way, it would be most unusual. We would submit if one was, for example, looking at contract and third parties in contract, the third party would be bound by a contract that they were not party to in the sense they had had nothing to do was creating the contract or taking on board any of the obligations of that contract. And overall, the thrust of our argument is really that it would be or a step too far for the European community to assume, whether by agreement or whether not by the agreement of the parents to assume jurisdiction over children who are lawfully resident in non Member States. And as an illustration, of course, in this case, we're considering a child that's habitually resident now in Pakistan, but as an illustration, one can imagine the reaction of other states perhaps, for example, the United States or the Russian Republic, to the idea that the European Union countries were claiming that they had primary jurisdiction again, I say, whether by agreement or not over a child that was lawfully resident in their country. And that is, if I can say so, My Lords and My Lady, the main thrust of our objection to that definition of third state, and we say that that is supported by, for example, the guidance to Brussels II Revised.
7	p1,01:38:41.050,01:41:01.030,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The predecessor to Brussels II revised was, of course, Brussels II. And that is a tab 6 in the authorities bundle volume one. And the comparison I wish to draw is, in fact, between the old article 3 under Brussels II and in fact, strictly, it's the matrimonial jurisdiction, Article 12 (1). Because, of course, there was no equivalent to Article 12 (3) in the Brussels II regulations. So if I could invite the court to have Brussels II at tab six, Article 3(1) and Brussels II revised Article 12(1), run open and compare the two. So tab 1 and tab 6 Brussels II Article 3(1) says the courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction by virtue of article to an application for divorce and legal separation of marriage annulment shall have jurisdiction in respect, in respect of matters, respect a matter of principle, overcharging both prizes where the child is habitually resident in that member state to where the child is not a bit she resident in the member state referred to in paragraph one. Yeah, the court of that state shall have jurisdiction shut a matter if the child is in which the present in one of the member states and and then the two tests are set out. At least one of the spouses has PR, and the jurisdiction has been accepted by the spouses and is in the best interests of the child.

7	p1,01:36:24.230,01:37:08.640,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Yes, that's right. The first question to be considered under Article 12 is whether the power to prorogue jurisdiction extends to children who are habitually resident in a state that is not a member state of the EU. The rationale for Article 12 is to provide an exception to the general rule. The jurisdiction matters of PR has converged on the member state of the child's habitual residence. Article 12, as well already identified provides two powers of propagation in matters of parental possibility. One in matrimonial, the other in non matrimonial proceedings. This case concerns a non matrimonial case.
7	p2,01:48:24.180,01:49:31.430,Respondent ,	True	Counsel: But what is being suggested here is that by agreement, and I don't accept that there was agreement by the parties, but that's a matter that I'll return to. But by agreement, parties can, in essence, impose the jurisdiction of Member States on a non Member State where a child is resident because that's the essence of what will happen. The court here will decide the case, and if the court decides, or the court in France or the court in Belgium will decide the case, and will then make orders which are to be carried out in a third country, or we, would say, in a non Member State and that that can't possibly have been within the remit or the consideration of the European community when it was drafting this regulation, there's nothing that indicates that it was.
7	p2,00:42:53.900,00:44:41.110,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: It does. I was going to go through Article 15 as it clearly is of interest. By way of exception, I underline that, where the Courts Member State having jurisdiction, so it's after jurisdiction is established, as to the substance of a matter, may, if they consider that a Court of another Member State with which the court has a particular connection, I'm underlining words which may be of interest to have a longer discussion about this, will be at a better place to hear the case, or a specific part thereof, and where this is in the best interest of the child, stay the case or the part thereof, and invite the parties to introduce a request or request a court of another Member State to assume jurisdiction according to paragraph 5. Paragraph 1 should apply upon the application from a party or if the courts are in motion, or upon the application from a court of another Member State with which the child has a particular connection in accordance with paragraph 3. A transfer made of the Court's own motion or the application of a court of a Member State must be accepted by at least one of the parties, so you can't do it if all the parties are against. The child shall be considered to have a particular connection, if -- there is a list of five factors in three. Four, the court of a Member State, having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter shall set a time limit by which the courts of that other Member State shall be seized in accordance with paragraph 1. If the courts are not seized by that time, the court which has been seized shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. In other words, if they refused the request or don't comply with the time limit, then the Court, the requesting Court, shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in the Court, 8 to 14. The courts of that other Member State may, due to the circumstance of the case, that this is in the best interests of the child, accept within six weeks of their seizure in accordance with paragraphs 1 (a) or (b). In this case, the Court first seized shall decline jurisdiction. Otherwise, the court first seized shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. The courts shall cooperate for the purposes of the Article. That's, in my submission, quite a complex framework for what I call consensual transfer from one court to another. It follows on, but in greater detail, the provisions of Article 10 of the 96 Convention to which which we looked at earlier. It's not the same as the English Court saying, I don't think this court is the best court. I'm going to stay the proceedings on the assumption the proceedings will be transferred to a non Member State.

7	p2,01:11:14.660,01:12:29.440,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: At every time. And of course it is, My Lord Clarke was quite right to remind me, the jurisdiction of the courts. The jurisdiction is in the best interests of the child. But that is very close to asking the welfare question, and it cannot be right in my submission at all points for the court to consider the welfare question in order to determine whether it has jurisdiction, since the point of establishing jurisdiction is to carry out the welfare exercise. In this case, of course, we're dealing with a country that isn't Pakistan that is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, and consequently, 12 (4) comes into play, and here we move into an element of some uncharted waters, an interpretation which we put forward without authority for discussion. This contains a deeming provision, where the child has habitual residence in the territory of a third state, which is not a contracting party of the Hague Convention, jurisdiction under this Article shall be deemed to be in the child's interest.
7	p1,01:56:27.930,01:57:00.690,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Bottom of page 45 describing Article 12 (4) as described in Chapter two, Article 12 of regulation introduces a limited prorogation option for a party to choose to seize a court of a member state in which the child is not habitually resident but with which the child is nevertheless a substantial connection. This option is not limited to situations where the child is habitually resident within the territory of a member state. But it applies also where the habitual residence of the child is in a third state that is not a contracting party to the 1996 Hague Convention.
7	p3,01:42:16.370,01:43:27.400,spk_5,	True	The Court: Now, there's nothing in the regulations that provides when that jurisdiction ceases. CF Article 12. In Article 12, there is an express provision about when the jurisdiction comes to an end. Now, there is no such provision in relation to Article 8. So, why does not one treat all the -- why would not if the Article applied, why would not the European court at least, treat, for purposes of the regulation, treat all, everything that has happened subsequently as part of the proceedings, which began when the first Article 8 proceedings began. Because they all relate to the parental responsibility in relation to the child. The child had its habitual residence within the jurisdiction at the time they began. There is nothing in the regulations would suggest that one should have artificial lines. The court would surely be treated, the court of the relevant member state would surely be treated as having seizing of the proceedings until the very end.
7	p1,01:37:11.450,01:38:39.850,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The first issue arising is whether that power is confined as his contended on behalf of the father, to children who are habitually resident within the EU or extends to all children. As we contend. If that construction is correct, jurisdiction could be [inaudible] to cover Q. Provided the criteria Article 12 for you are satisfied before I turn to the question of third State. Could I just invite the court to look at Article 12 (3) and its predecessor. Article 12 (3), which you have open in front of you, reads, well, the first part of it reads, The courts of a member state should also have jurisdiction in relation to proceedings other than those referred to in paragraph 1. Now its predecessor was -- I realised I've also not in the course of the argument gone through the history of the Brussels regulations, that is set out in full in my document, I assume I needn't do that.
7	p3,00:18:30.290,00:21:17.440,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Which is, what should be considered to be in the child's interest. The presumption being that if the member state in which the child is habitually resident is not a contracting party to the Hague Convention then it's presumed to be in the child's interests. It's presumed to be in the child's interest for the country favoured by and agreed on by the parents because the only use throughout this document for a third state on the construction that is being put to you, My Lords, on behalf of the appellant, is that there is one situation where this regulation would apply to non-contracting countries and that is if the parents or the parties choose that it should. And in no other circumstance would it be, would it apply to third countries or to non-contracting countries if I can use that term. That in itself, I think, is a curiosity. But I think that what and what we're trying to suggest to you, is that if you look at the construction of Article 12 in its entirety, the parties that are essentially referred to are parties first of all, to a marriage and parties who are parents to a child upon which some decision is going to be made with reference to parental responsibility. Now we would say that if it would not be unusual or unheard of for the parents to be living in separate states themselves, and that there may be three states involved and that it is for that reason, that the third state is referred to. So for example, and I mean one can only give examples, the parents may both live in Belgium, the father may spend a lot of his time in France, and the child may live with grandparents in Germany and they choose France to be the country that they want the matter to be heard for matters of convenience or matters that are important to them. They choose it, they choose it unequivocally. They go to the court and say, We wholeheartedly want this court to deal with it. And that that is where the third state comes in. And I would say that Article 6(1), if you accept my construction of third, capital S, State supports what I'm saying.
8	p1,01:36:24.230,01:37:08.640,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Yes, that's right. The first question to be considered under Article 12 is whether the power to prorogue jurisdiction extends to children who are habitually resident in a state that is not a member state of the EU. The rationale for Article 12 is to provide an exception to the general rule. The jurisdiction matters of PR has converged on the member state of the child's habitual residence. Article 12, as well already identified provides two powers of propagation in matters of parental possibility. One in matrimonial, the other in non matrimonial proceedings. This case concerns a non matrimonial case.
8	p3,00:21:33.760,00:22:43.980,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Well, I think that if it's a second state it means just the state that the child's living in. In other words, the child who is not a party to this or these discussions between these parents because the child's not represented or isn't deciding which jurisdiction. I think it's allowing for the fact that there will be cases and may often be cases, particularly in Hague Convention cases or abduction cases, where there are three states involved. Say, for example, if we look at Article 61 where a parent removes a child from territory A, country A, to territory C, to territory B, and the child's habitual residence is actually in territory C. That, I would say is what Article 61(b) is referring to when it talks about third states. And I can see our Lord's, that some of you are looking quizzical about that but I will return to why I'm saying.
8	p1,01:45:46.390,01:48:17.590,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It's not defined. Would that it were defined conclusively. I might just, Mr Setright was going to invite the court, perhaps to suggest possible amendments to the regulation. And certainly a definition section seems arguably, a definition of the phrase seems maybe necessary. We say it's not, we say it's clear. It's only mentioned twice the phrase third state in the regulations and the second in Article 61. We say this demonstrates beyond any conceivable argument. With respect to my learned friend that third state means non member state. Article 61 is about the relationship between this regulation and the Hague Convention 1996 on the jurisdiction applicable on recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children, which I shall call the 1996 Hague Convention for short. It reads as follows, As regards, as concerns relation with the 1996 Hague Convention, this regulation shall apply (a) where the child concerned has his or her habitual residence on the territory of a member state, (b) as concerns the recognition and enforcement of a judgment given in a court of a member state on the territory of another member state, even if the child concerned has his or her habitual residence on the territory of a third state, which is a contracting party to the said convention. In other words, the regulation always applies where the child is habitually resident in a third state and in addition, applies where the child is habitually resident on a third i.e. non member state as concerns the recognition and enforcement of a judgment given the member state A on the territory of member state B. There is no possible way that, we submit, in which third state in Article 61 can mean anything other than non member state. And it would, in our submission, be astonishing if any other interpretation was possible of the other reference to third state in the regulation.
8	p3,00:50:01.260,00:50:19.440,spk_4,	True	The Court: Why on Earth would they use the expression third state as opposed to another member state? As My Lady pointed out, the indefinite article qualifies member state the territory of a member state. But it applies also with the habitual residence if the child is in a third state. If that is --
8	p4,00:05:02.040,00:05:17.710,spk_3,	False	
8	p1,01:57:06.230,01:57:37.650,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Yes, we say that that clearly contrasts third state with a member state. If, of course, it's only persuasive authority. But we submit that, coupled with the obvious interpretation of Article 61 illustrates the third state in Article 12 (4) means non member state. Where that gets to My Lord is a matter which I will consider next. Would it be helpful, I note the time --
8	p2,01:48:24.180,01:49:31.430,Respondent ,	True	Counsel: But what is being suggested here is that by agreement, and I don't accept that there was agreement by the parties, but that's a matter that I'll return to. But by agreement, parties can, in essence, impose the jurisdiction of Member States on a non Member State where a child is resident because that's the essence of what will happen. The court here will decide the case, and if the court decides, or the court in France or the court in Belgium will decide the case, and will then make orders which are to be carried out in a third country, or we, would say, in a non Member State and that that can't possibly have been within the remit or the consideration of the European community when it was drafting this regulation, there's nothing that indicates that it was.

8	p2,01:39:29.120,01:40:05.230,Respondent ,	True	Counsel: Thank you, My Lord. My Lord, if I may, first return to the matter of Article 12 (4) in particular, and the term third state. And it is our strong contention that third state within the context of Brussels II Revised refers to states within Member States, within the European Union, who are non contracting members, non contracting states to the Hague Convention.
8	p1,01:41:12.310,01:43:25.140,spk_0,	False	
8	p3,00:15:41.110,00:16:53.840,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I hope not to take too long about this because my Lord's have already heard so much about it, by looking at 12(4) where the phrase itself arises. The territory where the child has his or her habitual residence in the territory of a third state. And the piece of pedantry that I am indulging in is asking the court to look at the fact that state has a capital s. Now if I could go back to the fact that it's clear from the use of language in copious amounts of commentary and literature that third state, that's to say, small t small s, is used constantly to mean a non-contracting state. I accept that on the face of it, this language would without more read as if third state here means non-contracting state to this regulation and indeed to the Brussels Conventions generally.
8	p2,01:40:10.810,01:40:59.370,Respondent ,	True	Counsel: And it is within that context that they are described as third states. And I've set out, I think, briefly in our case, some of the reasons why we say that. But if we look at the regulations themselves regarding the two points where third state is mentioned and also looking again at the Articles referring to third states, the first one is, of course, and the first mention is at 12 (4), and you could say that the meaning there is where the child has his or her habitual residence in the territory or the state which is not a contracting party to the Hague Convention, then the indication is that it is presumed to be in the child's interest, particularly if it's not possible to hold proceedings in that member state to hold proceedings in the state that the parties have agreed upon. And I will return to the matter of agreement later. If one also considers Article 61, which deals with relations with the Hague Convention of October 1996, at (b) of that particular Article, it refers to the recognition and enforcement of the judgment given at the court of the Member State and at the territory of another Member State, even if the child concerned has his or her habitual residence on the territory of a third state, which is a contracting party to the convention. And then we would say that the question of the definition of third state has to be seen within the context of the convention as a whole. And when one considers the convention as a whole, the preamble and the guidance, which I will again return to, it's clear the objective is to create an area within the community itself to allow freedom of movement of persons, including to adopt the judicial cooperation in civil matters and the proper functioning of the internal market. So that is the context of this. And Lord Collins referred to the fact that third state could be seen, perhaps in the same way that one might refer to a third party. But if one looks at the council regulation in that way, it would be most unusual. We would submit if one was, for example, looking at contract and third parties in contract, the third party would be bound by a contract that they were not party to in the sense they had had nothing to do was creating the contract or taking on board any of the obligations of that contract. And overall, the thrust of our argument is really that it would be or a step too far for the European community to assume, whether by agreement or whether not by the agreement of the parents to assume jurisdiction over children who are lawfully resident in non Member States. And as an illustration, of course, in this case, we're considering a child that's habitually resident now in Pakistan, but as an illustration, one can imagine the reaction of other states perhaps, for example, the United States or the Russian Republic, to the idea that the European Union countries were claiming that they had primary jurisdiction again, I say, whether by agreement or not over a child that was lawfully resident in their country. And that is, if I can say so, My Lords and My Lady, the main thrust of our objection to that definition of third state, and we say that that is supported by, for example, the guidance to Brussels II Revised.

They use non member state in lieu. There's a book by Dr Talia Krueger called Civil Jurisdiction Rules of the EU and Their Impact on Third States, which I apprehend some of the court Lord Collins particularly, may have been familiar with. She uses the phrase third state to mean non member state throughout. She's from South Africa, and she begins her preface with the sentence, Coming from a third state myself, I was stunned by how much the European Union has achieved, especially in law. And the practice guide tab 2, in Brussels II revised we submit makes it equally clear. If you look at page 45.

And you've already been referred to that by a very learned friend for the mother. The discussions are about the again, of course, the term Member State is used and the term Member State is used throughout except where it's saying that this article should be deemed, and one presumes that's where my learned friend got the word deemed from, but shall be deemed to be in the child's best interest when the child in question is habitually resident to a third state that is not a contracting state to the Hague Convention. To differentiate between Member States who are and Member States who are not contracting states to the Hague Convention.
9	p2,00:22:13.840,00:24:14.450,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: I don't think I can add to that debate, My Lady, because I've obviously been focusing on the more contentious aspects as far as [inaudible] is concerned. And so I turn to the other two hurdles, which I have to get over and the first is that the jurisdiction the court has been expressed accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. And there are two components of that which we need to consider. And the first I want to consider is at the time the court is seized. And of course, here there is a distinction between -- the issue is, does that refer to a specific event in time, meaning when the court is first seized, or a continuum of time, such a period of time as the court is seized? The Court of Appeal held that it meant the latter. It's our submission that it means the former. Although crucially, of course, later events are relevant in determining the position at the outset of the proceedings. We rely on a number of points in support of our preferred interpretation. We submit that the word, has been, in Article 12 (3) (b), is more consistent with a specific point in time. We point to the fact that under Article eight, the same phrase is used. Articulate the basic general jurisdiction. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of principle, over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seized. It is our submission to the court that the contrary interpretation would drain any meaning or effectiveness from the articles, because the crucial purpose of a jurisdictional rule, in our submission, is to determine whether the court has jurisdiction at the start of the proceedings, so they continue to determine the issue.
9	p2,00:19:48.640,00:21:06.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Article 12 (3) of Brussels II Revised specifies three criteria for the prorogation of jurisdiction by courts of a Member State in matters of responsibility over a child, all of which have to be satisfied, namely, one, that the child has a substantial connection with that Member State. Article 12 (3) (a). Two that the jurisdiction of the court has been accepted expressly or otherwise, in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. Article 12 (3) (b). And three, the jurisdictions in the best interests of the child. Article 12 (3) (b) again. Now as far as the first criterion is concerned, Article 12 (3) (a), that is manifestly satisfied, and this is not contentious because under Article 12 (3) (a) itself specifically provides that a substantial connection will be established, in particular, by virtue of the fact that one of the holders of parental responsibility is habitually resident in that Member State or the child is a national of that Member State. In this case, both of those exemplar conditions are satisfied and consequently, as agreed by all parties, the child has a substantial connection with this country.
9	p1,01:41:12.310,01:43:25.140,spk_0,	True	Counsel: No, it's not. But the point is that I succeed to make is that in those circumstances, under Article 3, there is an express reference to habitual residents. So where the child is not habitually resident in the member state, the court of that state shall have jurisdiction in such matters. If the child habitual resident in one of the member states and the test is satisfied, police are satisfied. Contrast Article 12, which of course, is headed prorogation, The courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction in divorce proceedings shall have jurisdiction in relation any matter where any parents really connected with that application, where and then the hurdles are inserted. So there is no reference, no restriction there to children who are habitually resident in one of the member states. [Pause]. And in our submission, there's no justification for reading into Article 12 (1). Or more importantly, for this case, Article 12 (3). The phrase in respect of a child who is habitually resident in a member state. I think this is a rhetorical point. If the authors had intended to limit the scope of the jurisdictional rules to cases where the trial was a fixture at the member state, given that they said so now in Brussels II we submit they surely would have done in Brussels II revised. The Court: Another way of putting that is that the commission must be presumed to be deliberate. Counsel: Yes, My Lord, and that first point --
9	p2,00:26:35.130,00:27:05.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: My submission to the court will be that it is, and may I come back to that My Lord? Because that is obviously a linked but different point. And again, towards the end of my submissions on this point, draw your attention back to the practise guide at page 12, tab 2 page 12, reminding ourselves, of course, this is only a persuasive authority, actually, it's 13. Top of the page, page 13. The question of jurisdiction is determined at the time the court is seized. Once a competent court is seized, in principle, it retains jurisdiction even if the child acquires habitual residence in another Member State during the course of the court proceeding. That, of course, is dealing with the Article 8 point and in my submission illustrates clearly the point that I've been making. Tab 2 page 13 top of the page. Now one of the factors which influenced the Court of Appeal's contrary interpretation was that it would preclude any party subsequently joined to the proceedings from having any right to refuse to accept jurisdiction. Obviously, parties can be added to the proceedings, all proceedings, not only family proceedings, and not infrequently are. And in this case, of course, the child as we've established was joined as a party to these proceedings. And Lord Justice Thorpe pointed out that if consent was confined to those parties who were parties at the outset of the proceedings, that would deprive a later joint party, in particular a child through the guardian, of the right to object to the court's jurisdiction. Well, My Lord, our response to that is, that's right, it does have that consequence, and the fact that it has that consequence does not, in our submission, in any way undermine the clear interpretation and meaning of the phrase. Parties added later cannot object, in our submission, to the jurisdiction. Although of course they can in this instance under the Children Act, invite the court not to make any order in the proceedings to which they have been joined. So we submit that Lord Justice Thorpe is right. It does have that consequence, but it is the clear consequence of the interpretation, which we say is absolutely absolutely clear on the words of the document.
9	p4,00:26:11.140,00:27:41.310,spk_1,	True	Counsel: That wasn't done in this case, and I have to say from experience it tends not to be done, save by rare first instance judges, in any case. Taking it forward if one considers the effect of Article 17 of the revised regulation. Article 17, coupled together with Article 18 provides a positive onus on judges to consider jurisdiction at the earliest possible stage and realistically, there's a limit to the scope for that to be done when proceedings are launched. And that comes to the analysis of the interplay between the different aspects of Article 12(3)(b) and that is to say accepted express or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. At the time the court is seized, it may well be that there is only one active party. The other party won't necessarily have had the chance to say anything at all. And there is a difficulty at the moment with that. It's a difficulty which some practitioners address by writing on a document acknowledging service, that acknowledgement is made subject to a challenge to jurisdiction.
9	p2,01:11:14.660,01:12:29.440,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: At every time. And of course it is, My Lord Clarke was quite right to remind me, the jurisdiction of the courts. The jurisdiction is in the best interests of the child. But that is very close to asking the welfare question, and it cannot be right in my submission at all points for the court to consider the welfare question in order to determine whether it has jurisdiction, since the point of establishing jurisdiction is to carry out the welfare exercise. In this case, of course, we're dealing with a country that isn't Pakistan that is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, and consequently, 12 (4) comes into play, and here we move into an element of some uncharted waters, an interpretation which we put forward without authority for discussion. This contains a deeming provision, where the child has habitual residence in the territory of a third state, which is not a contracting party of the Hague Convention, jurisdiction under this Article shall be deemed to be in the child's interest.
9	p2,00:42:53.900,00:44:41.110,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: It does. I was going to go through Article 15 as it clearly is of interest. By way of exception, I underline that, where the Courts Member State having jurisdiction, so it's after jurisdiction is established, as to the substance of a matter, may, if they consider that a Court of another Member State with which the court has a particular connection, I'm underlining words which may be of interest to have a longer discussion about this, will be at a better place to hear the case, or a specific part thereof, and where this is in the best interest of the child, stay the case or the part thereof, and invite the parties to introduce a request or request a court of another Member State to assume jurisdiction according to paragraph 5. Paragraph 1 should apply upon the application from a party or if the courts are in motion, or upon the application from a court of another Member State with which the child has a particular connection in accordance with paragraph 3. A transfer made of the Court's own motion or the application of a court of a Member State must be accepted by at least one of the parties, so you can't do it if all the parties are against. The child shall be considered to have a particular connection, if -- there is a list of five factors in three. Four, the court of a Member State, having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter shall set a time limit by which the courts of that other Member State shall be seized in accordance with paragraph 1. If the courts are not seized by that time, the court which has been seized shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. In other words, if they refused the request or don't comply with the time limit, then the Court, the requesting Court, shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in the Court, 8 to 14. The courts of that other Member State may, due to the circumstance of the case, that this is in the best interests of the child, accept within six weeks of their seizure in accordance with paragraphs 1 (a) or (b). In this case, the Court first seized shall decline jurisdiction. Otherwise, the court first seized shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. The courts shall cooperate for the purposes of the Article. That's, in my submission, quite a complex framework for what I call consensual transfer from one court to another. It follows on, but in greater detail, the provisions of Article 10 of the 96 Convention to which which we looked at earlier. It's not the same as the English Court saying, I don't think this court is the best court. I'm going to stay the proceedings on the assumption the proceedings will be transferred to a non Member State.

9	p2,00:51:20.810,00:53:49.170,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Lord Collins' -- Lord Justice Lawrence's, at paragraph 53 on page 11. It is plain that Article 12 (1) (b) of Brussels II Revised when it speaks to the jurisdiction being quote, except expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized is not simply referring to a mere submission in matrimonial proceedings equivalent to what would be an entry of appearance under Brussels I Article 24. First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction to enrage the matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner. This must mean that accepting the jurisdiction of a court, other than that of a child's habitual residence, is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be [inaudible] by the parties at the time the proceedings are instituted. And then Your Lordship proceeded to recite the [inaudible] 12 to the regulation in paragraph 54. The first point, My Lord, we need to consider here, because in that case, the case turned on whether acknowledging the service effectively or whether the filing of a statement of arrangements in divorce proceedings amounted to consent. The court held not. The point I want to concentrate on is the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner, this must mean that acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be attributed by the parent at the time the proceedings are instituted. Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case.
9	p1,01:14:07.660,01:15:14.060,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The court will, perhaps apprehended for our part, my part particularly concerned that focuses above all on the issues that arise in this case which are by themselves equally interesting and perhaps certainly are important and definitely arise in this case, the second of those is of course, the proper interpretation of Article 12(3) with 12(4), and we focused on the meaning of the phrase third state, and that is a hotly disputed topic between the learned friend and myself. Then we consider the two hurdles under the prorogation provisions, which are relevant in this case, the proper interpretation of the phrase quote, The jurisdiction of the court has been accepted, expressed or otherwise, in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized, which involves two elements at the time is court is seized and unequivocal acceptance and then the phrase that interpretation, the phrase in the best interests of the child and then the fifth point --
9	p4,00:55:21.360,00:56:51.150,spk_1,	True	Counsel: It is very hard to think My Lord, although no doubt it's not beyond those who are in this court, of a children's case in which, following taking up of jurisdiction on this application of Article 12(3) if that view prevails, someone comes along on behalf of the child and makes a submission that the jurisdiction is not in the child's best interest on other than a factual basis, which needs to be translated into some practical arrangement. Even if it is only that, for example, the child could not be transported should not be transported to this country. It's not in the child's best interests. Or that there is some particular reason why it is not in the child's best interests to engage in an English process or some particular work needs to be done in the other jurisdiction. The English court could then say so and say in that event, we're not going to make orders. And in accordance with the principal of Article 12, subsequent litigation should take place in the country of habitual residence. The exception no longer applies. That's one way of doing it, which might very well be ECJ compliant because it would follow so closely on the reasoning of the regulation itself.

In Article 12, there is an express provision about when the jurisdiction comes to an end. Now, there is no such provision in relation to Article 8. So, why does not one treat all the -- why would not if the Article applied, why would not the European court at least, treat, for purposes of the regulation, treat all, everything that has happened subsequently as part of the proceedings, which began when the first Article 8 proceedings began. Because they all relate to the parental responsibility in relation to the child. The child had its habitual residence within the jurisdiction at the time they began. There is nothing in the regulations would suggest that one should have artificial lines. The court would surely be treated, the court of the relevant member state would surely be treated as having seizing of the proceedings until the very end.

We ask the question, what does it mean where it says at the end of Article 12(4), measures jurisdiction in this article shall be deemed to be in the child's interests, particularly if it is found impossible to hold proceeds in the third state in question. The suggestion we put forward is that there is a presumption that the child is habitually resident in the third state and that it is irrebuttable --
9	p1,01:56:27.930,01:57:00.690,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Bottom of page 45 describing Article 12(4) as described in Chapter two, Article 12 of regulation introduces a limited propagation option for a party to choose to seize a court of a member state in which the child is not habitually resident but with which the child is nevertheless a substantial connection. This option is not limited to situations where the child is habitually resident within the territory of a member state. But it applies also where the habitual residence of the child is in a third state that is not a contracting party to the 1996 Hague Convention.
10	p4,00:26:11.140,00:27:41.310,spk_1,	True	Counsel: That wasn't done in this case, and I have to say from experience it tends not to be done, save by rare first instance judges, in any case. Taking it forward if one considers the effect of Article 17 of the revised regulation. Article 17, coupled together with Article 18 provides a positive onus on judges to consider jurisdiction at the earliest possible stage and realistically, there's a limit to the scope for that to be done when proceedings are launched. And that comes to the analysis of the interplay between the different aspects of Article 12(3)(b) and that is to say accepted express or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. At the time the court is seized, it may well be that there is only one active party. The other party won't necessarily have had the chance to say anything at all. And there is a difficulty at the moment with that. It's a difficulty which some practitioners address by writing on a document acknowledging service, that acknowledgement is made subject to a challenge to jurisdiction.

10	p2,00:51:20.810,00:53:49.170,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Lord Collins' -- Lord Justice Lawrence's, at paragraph 53 on page 11. It is plain that Article 12(1)(b) of Brussels II Revised when it speaks to the jurisdiction being quote, except expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized is not simply referring to a mere submission in matrimonial proceedings equivalent to what would be an entry of appearance under Brussels I Article 24. First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction to enrage the matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner. This must mean that accepting the jurisdiction of a court, other than that of a child's habitual residence, is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be [inaudible] by the parties at the time the proceedings are instituted. And then Your Lordship proceeded to recite the [inaudible] 12 to the regulation in paragraph 54. The first point, My Lord, we need to consider here, because in that case, the case turned on whether acknowledging the service effectively or whether the filing of a statement of arrangements in divorce proceedings amounted to consent. The court held not. The point I want to concentrate on is the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner, this must mean that acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be attributed by the parent at the time the proceedings are instituted. Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case.
10	p2,01:10:15.330,01:10:34.060,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Yes, in my submission, the only reasonable and practical construction is that that falls to be considered at the time the court is seized, i.e. at the outset of the proceedings, and it's not something which falls to be considered at all points during the course of the proceedings. The reason for that is the purposive argument that the purpose of Article 12 is to enable the court to determine whether it has jurisdiction and in my submission, it would be manifestly unworkable if the court were required, the instance of any party to review the question whether it still has jurisdiction at all stages of the proceedings. Either the court has jurisdiction or it does not.

10	p3,01:02:02.600,01:03:23.640,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I'm saying that the court has to look -- once the court is seized of the matter at the beginning, which is in the sense when the proceedings were started in favour of the matter is filed, the court is seized of it then, but the court continues to be seized with it. And there are two reasons why I'm saying that one has to look at the continuance of the seizing of the court. The first is that one cannot glean unequivocal acceptance unless it's expressly made and that's something that I'm going to have to deal with separately. And also, because it says all the parties and it is very common, certainly in children cases, for children to become involved if there have been, for example, public law cases in the background such as there are here. And it is those kind of cases where there would be children living in non-European Union countries as well. Those are the kind of cases that we're looking at within the context of this case.
10	p2,00:22:13.840,00:24:14.450,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: I don't think I can add to that debate, My Lady, because I've obviously been focusing on the more contentious aspects as far as [inaudible] is concerned. And so I turn to the other two hurdles, which I have to get over and the first is that the jurisdiction the court has been expressed accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. And there are two components of that which we need to consider. And the first I want to consider is at the time the court is seized. And of course, here there is a distinction between -- the issue is, does that refer to a specific event in time, meaning when the court is first seized, or a continuum of time, such a period of time as the court is seized? The Court of Appeal held that it meant the latter. It's our submission that it means the former. Although crucially, of course, later events are relevant in determining the position at the outset of the proceedings. We rely on a number of points in support of our preferred interpretation. We submit that the word, has been, in Article 12(3)(b), is more consistent with a specific point in time. We point to the fact that under Article eight, the same phrase is used. Articulate the basic general jurisdiction. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of principle, over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seized. It is our submission to the court that the contrary interpretation would drain any meaning or effectiveness from the articles, because the crucial purpose of a jurisdictional rule, in our submission, is to determine whether the court has jurisdiction at the start of the proceedings, so they continue to determine the issue.
10	p4,00:33:52.440,00:37:24.460,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Many years ago, this house and I'm afraid I've not put the authority before the house, considered the concept of retention in child abduction cases. It was H and S and the parties argued on the one hand, I said this house that house it was, on the one hand, the contention that retention was a continuing stage under the Hague Convention, one could pick the date that was most convenient for the parties to illustrate a point. Or in this case, a date following a contracting state entering the relevant convention. The House said no fixed terminus a quo, and one has to look at the earlier state of retention despite the word retention which carries with it a certain continuum. In this case, we suggest seizing is clear. It's got to be that early moment that the regulation doesn't give scope for any other interpretation. But an evaluation of jurisdiction will be based on material which of course will gradually grow with the progression of the proceedings. And this will be the case in every set of proceedings. It will grow first when a second party has joined in practical terms. Thus the document starting the proceedings is issued and served, and then in some proceedings, most proceedings, the party served will have the opportunity to respond. Then there will be a court appearance and then there may be submissions and there may be evidence. We suggest that there are a number of ways of looking at Article 12(3). One is to say yes, it's got to be determined at the moment of seizing with such material as may be available at the moment of seizing. So perhaps a judge who may be a judge at a very low level in a registry who receives a paper application will have to look at it and say, Well does Article 12(3) apply because there is a consent? In that case, there'd have to be a fairly radical overhaul of the way proceedings are started if people are to have the chance of accepting or not accepting. A second possibility is that which I've postulated as the rabbit pulled out of the hat. A third is to say the date is the date of seizing. One can look at material, which comes to light subsequent to that, but rather as one would in public law care proceedings. One has to look back to that particular date to see what the position was then. There's an argument that in this case, such a test would be satisfied because of the undertakings given in the relocation in proceedings.

10	p2,00:26:35.130,00:27:05.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: My submission to the court will be that it is, and may I come back to that My Lord? Because that is obviously a linked but different point. And again, towards the end of my submissions on this point, draw your attention back to the practise guide at page 12, tab 2 page 12, reminding ourselves, of course, this is only a persuasive authority, actually, it's 13. Top of the page, page 13. The question of jurisdiction is determined at the time the court is seized. Once a competent court is seized, in principle, it retains jurisdiction even if the child acquires habitual residence in another Member State during the course of the court proceeding. That, of course, is dealing with the Article 8 point and in my submission illustrates clearly the point that I've been making. Tab 2 page 13 top of the page. Now one of the factors which influenced the Court of Appeal's contrary interpretation was that it would preclude any party subsequently joined to the proceedings from having any right to refuse to accept jurisdiction. Obviously, parties can be added to the proceedings, all proceedings, not only family proceedings, and not infrequently are. And in this case, of course, the child as we've established was joined as a party to these proceedings. And Lord Justice Thorpe pointed out that if consent was confined to those parties who were parties at the outset of the proceedings, that would deprive a later joint party, in particular a child through the guardian, of the right to object to the court's jurisdiction. Well, My Lord, our response to that is, that's right, it does have that consequence, and the fact that it has that consequence does not, in our submission, in any way undermine the clear interpretation and meaning of the phrase. Parties added later cannot object, in our submission, to the jurisdiction. Although of course they can in this instance under the Children Act, invite the court not to make any order in the proceedings to which they have been joined. So we submit that Lord Justice Thorpe is right. It does have that consequence, but it is the clear consequence of the interpretation, which we say is absolutely absolutely clear on the words of the document.

10	p4,00:30:23.720,00:31:15.860,spk_1,	True	Counsel: I hope I haven't fallen flat. If one looks carefully at Article 12(3)(b) and one reads it in this way. The jurisdiction of the court has been, past tense, accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner, and I'm now going to read it with an emphasis, By all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. So, in other words, that's a description, not at the time at which there must be the express acceptance, but the time at which the constituent parties who have to give their consent are counted.
10	p2,01:02:18.080,01:03:23.320,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: And in this case we're looking at a child's welfare, several years on into the proceedings. This point was considered, actually, My Lord, by Mr Justice Hedley in another case, the case of C v C, which is at tab 25 in the authority. So in my copy, that's volume two of the authority, tab 25. It is reported somewhere that we've got the [inaudible] report, and this is about a case in which a mother had been given permission to remove a child to Spain. A lot of the cases involve Spain. And the father subsequently brought further proceedings in England for contact with the child. Paragraph 12, the father's counsel says this. He says at all times, up to a letter, last summer, the mother fully participated in the proceedings. At all material times she was representative, took no issue on jurisdiction, even though the children must have been habitually resident in Spain for many months. It is true that the wording is in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized. That cannot, he contends, be narrowly construed since at the time of being seized, the issue of an application, a respondent may well have no knowledge of the matter. He submits to the court, absent express acceptance and has agreed that there is none here. Must look at the litigation, conduct and draw inferences from it. He estimated there is only one inference here, and that is now too late to object to jurisdiction of this current matter. Paragraph 16, halfway down the page, halfway down the paragraph, line seven, given that Miss Harding cannot challenge the fact on the mother's participation in the proceeding, she's for the mother, including an application whilst acting in person for an extension of time, the question can be further refined, and I think this is My Lord's point, can the mother be said to have accepted jurisdiction in an unequivocal map if she had never appreciated that it was able to challenge. It is that question that I'm required to answer. It would be unreal to think that the question of jurisdiction has never occurred to anyone. And I interject that in this case we know that it had. That said, however, I do accept Miss Harding's submission that no one ever saw it as a problem, and thus the mother did not specifically address in her mind an objection to it. In my judgement, the fundamental approach to this should be, what inference should be drawn from the mother's litigation conduct? The answer to that is clear. Complete acceptance. Then one should ask whether a failure to address the question of challenge vitiates what otherwise appears to be an unequivocal acceptance. I do not think it does. This case demonstrates a clear acceptance of the court's jurisdiction at least until late 2006, by which time, at any [inaudible] the court must be seized with the matter. Accordingly, it is then too late to object. In my judgement, the evidence demonstrates unequivocal participation in the proceedings and thus an acceptance of the jurisdiction. I do not think that the absence, as I'm prepared to accept it was, of advice on her right to object should vitiate the unequivocal acceptance otherwise is damaged. I'm glad to reach that view in this case, as questions of jurisdiction should be resolved at the outset of the case are not on the eve of the final hearing. That point of policy also fortifies my view that the court should be looking at what the partners have actually done, rather than the reasons or lack of them for doing it absent, of course, for misrepresentation. So that's the view of an extremely experienced judgment at first instance, addresses the very point Your Lordship was making.

Then we consider the two hurdles under the prorogation provisions, which are relevant in this case, the proper interpretation of the phrase quote, The jurisdiction of the court has been accepted, expressed or otherwise, in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized, which involves two elements at the time is court is seized and unequivocal acceptance and then the phrase that interpretation, the phrase in the best interests of the child and then the fifth point --

Another possibility is that they somehow become new proceedings when the child is joined, because otherwise it makes very little sense of the expression, All the parties. But we'll come back to that. But your case is it's the 2007 proceedings. We're only concerned with Article 12(3), not Article 12(1), is that right? Counsel: Yes. The Court: And that the only parties to the proceedings are the parents? So whether the child ever agreed anything is irrelevant is that right?

Suppose for a moment we accept the view that the court is seized at the moment of the moment identified in Article 16 which is at the time when the document instituting the proceedings is launched with the court. Now in that analysis, assuming that there is nothing occurred prior to 2007, assuming we don't have regard in some way to the care proceedings and it strikes me that the European Court might not look at it as narrow, instead they might look at all these proceedings together for this purpose. I don't know. But let's assume we were just looking at in a national way and the proceedings we're looking at are the ones that began on October 2007.

And that, I would have thought in the common law position, would be the way you address issues of jurisdiction. If in an ordinary action outside this particular regime, the opposing party comes in, says nothing to the contrary and simply lodges the documents opposing, without any kind of protest you would regard that as an acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court. Counsel: On the face of it yes, you would. The Court: The court has then got both parties before it and is then fully seized if I can inject [inaudible] and everybody knows where they are. Otherwise, while I absolutely understand the precision of Lord Clarke's approach, it does seem to me to be a tying it very narrowly to a situation where parties have got together before the application is made and the applicant can then put in together with the application, attached to it, an express agreement or a narrative that explains why my agreement has been reached.

At the time the court is seized, it may well be that there is only one active party. The other party won't necessarily have had the chance to say anything at all. And there is a difficulty at the moment with that. It's a difficulty which some practitioners address by writing on a document acknowledging service, that acknowledgement is made subject to a challenge to jurisdiction.

11	p2,01:02:18.080,01:03:23.320,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: And in this case we're looking at a child's welfare, several years on into the proceedings. This point was considered, actually, My Lord, by Mr Justice Hedley in another case, the case of C v C, which is at tab 25 in the authority. So in my copy, that's volume two of the authority, tab 25. It is reported somewhere that we've got the [inaudible] report, and this is about a case in which a mother had been given permission to remove a child to Spain. A lot of the cases involve Spain. And the father subsequently brought further proceedings in England for contact with the child. Paragraph 12, the father's counsel says this. He says at all times, up to a letter, last summer, the mother fully participated in the proceedings. At all material times she was representative, took no issue on jurisdiction, even though the children must have been habitually resident in Spain for many months. It is true that the wording is in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized. That cannot, he contends, be narrowly construed since at the time of being seized, the issue of an application, a respondent may well have no knowledge of the matter. He submits to the court, absent express acceptance and has agreed that there is none here. Must look at the litigation, conduct and draw inferences from it. He estimated there is only one inference here, and that is now too late to object to jurisdiction of this current matter. Paragraph 16, halfway down the page, halfway down the paragraph, line seven, given that Miss Harding cannot challenge the fact on the mother's participation in the proceeding, she's for the mother, including an application whilst acting in person for an extension of time, the question can be further refined, and I think this is My Lord's point, can the mother be said to have accepted jurisdiction in an unequivocal map if she had never appreciated that it was able to challenge. It is that question that I'm required to answer. It would be unreal to think that the question of jurisdiction has never occurred to anyone. And I interject that in this case we know that it had. That said, however, I do accept Miss Harding's submission that no one ever saw it as a problem, and thus the mother did not specifically address in her mind an objection to it. In my judgement, the fundamental approach to this should be, what inference should be drawn from the mother's litigation conduct? The answer to that is clear. Complete acceptance. Then one should ask whether a failure to address the question of challenge vitiates what otherwise appears to be an unequivocal acceptance. I do not think it does. This case demonstrates a clear acceptance of the court's jurisdiction at least until late 2006, by which time, at any [inaudible] the court must be seized with the matter. Accordingly, it is then too late to object. In my judgement, the evidence demonstrates unequivocal participation in the proceedings and thus an acceptance of the jurisdiction. I do not think that the absence, as I'm prepared to accept it was, of advice on her right to object should vitiate the unequivocal acceptance otherwise is damaged. I'm glad to reach that view in this case, as questions of jurisdiction should be resolved at the outset of the case are not on the eve of the final hearing. That point of policy also fortifies my view that the court should be looking at what the partners have actually done, rather than the reasons or lack of them for doing it absent, of course, for misrepresentation. So that's the view of an extremely experienced judgment at first instance, addresses the very point Your Lordship was making.
11	p4,01:24:54.920,01:25:37.450,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Yes, as a matter of construction My Lords but it's not going to rise in practise after the question of jurisdiction is presented by the court. Well, if the court has to ask itself, Have I got jurisdiction. If the court did do that in this case until very late in the day. But if it asks at the outset, do I have jurisdiction? Then one of the questions the judge has to consider is do the parties agree or have they unequivocally accepted? If they haven't unequivocally accepted, that them to the election. Do you agree? If they say no, then he doesn't have jurisdiction under Article 12(3). If they say yes, then he does, and that's the end of it.
11	p3,01:23:13.800,01:24:36.770,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Even if one accepts that the moment that the court has seized is the moment and one looks at it from that point of view, I would say in this case, there is no evidence that he unequivocally accepted the case. Certainly at the beginning, he wasn't represented the first time that he appeared at court. It was in person and his use of language is very limited and to impute acceptance at that point when the court is at where it becomes fully seized. I know that that's not correct terminology, really. But to impute that at the first opportunity, at the first time that the court had to assess acceptance, would be wrong. The first time that they had to assess acceptance if one is looking at the first point in time is when both parties appeared before the court unrepresented and Mr I had no interpreter. And so you couldn't say that it was an unequivocal acceptance and that was the first opportunity that the court had to assess that situation. But if you take -- 
11	p3,01:13:04.840,01:13:49.670,spk_5,	True	The Court: I'm on the moment of seizing. On the hypothesis that on the true construction of the Article, we're looking for a single moment. I know you don't accept that. But assuming that we are correct, contrary to your argument, then we need to identify what that moment is. The moment is that identified as I see it, speaking entirely for myself, by Article 16. So, we have to look at the moment when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court. And that was in 31st of October 2007 or maybe a day or two later. So, on that hypothesis, we will be focusing would be only on the question whether there had been an acceptance.

12	p3,01:11:39.310,01:12:29.170,spk_5,	True	The Court: There are various alternative ways of looking at it depending on which of your various submissions we accept. Suppose for a moment we accept the view that the court is seized at the moment of the moment identified in Article 16 which is at the time when the document instituting the proceedings is launched with the court. Now in that analysis, assuming that there is nothing occurred prior to 2007, assuming we don't have regard in some way to the care proceedings and it strikes me that the European Court might not look at it as narrow, instead they might look at all these proceedings together for this purpose. I don't know. But let's assume we were just looking at in a national way and the proceedings we're looking at are the ones that began on October 2007.

12	p3,01:38:30.700,01:38:55.250,spk_2,	True	The Court: One possibility is one actually has an express written agreement between the parties at some earlier stage. Let's assume it was there in September 2004, one had actually a document which they both signed saying, We accept the jurisdiction of the English courts in regard to our parental responsibility and in regard to this child. Not tied to any particular proceedings it's just simply accepting the jurisdiction of the court.

12	p3,01:02:02.600,01:03:23.640,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I'm saying that the court has to look -- once the court is seized of the matter at the beginning, which is in the sense when the proceedings were started in favour of the matter is filed, the court is seized of it then, but the court continues to be seized with it. And there are two reasons why I'm saying that one has to look at the continuance of the seizing of the court. The first is that one cannot glean unequivocal acceptance unless it's expressly made and that's something that I'm going to have to deal with separately. And also, because it says all the parties and it is very common, certainly in children cases, for children to become involved if there have been, for example, public law cases in the background such as there are here. And it is those kind of cases where there would be children living in non-European Union countries as well. Those are the kind of cases that we're looking at within the context of this case.
12	p3,01:18:19.470,01:19:26.270,spk_2,	True	The Court: There is a third alternative if I may respectfully say so, and that is that the continuum of time until it has become clear what the party's position is. And that, I would have thought in the common law position, would be the way you address issues of jurisdiction. If in an ordinary action outside this particular regime, the opposing party comes in, says nothing to the contrary and simply lodges the documents opposing, without any kind of protest you would regard that as an acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court. Counsel: On the face of it yes, you would. The Court: The court has then got both parties before it and is then fully seized if I can inject [inaudible] and everybody knows where they are. Otherwise, while I absolutely understand the precision of Lord Clarke's approach, it does seem to me to be a tying it very narrowly to a situation where parties have got together before the application is made and the applicant can then put in together with the application, attached to it, an express agreement or a narrative that explains why my agreement has been reached.
12	p3,01:13:04.840,01:13:49.670,spk_5,	True	The Court: I'm on the moment of seizing. On the hypothesis that on the true construction of the Article, we're looking for a single moment.

12	p4,00:30:23.720,00:31:15.860,spk_1,	True	Counsel: I hope I haven't fallen flat. If one looks carefully at Article 12(3)(b) and one reads it in this way. The jurisdiction of the court has been past tense, accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner, and I'm now going to read it with an emphasis by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. So, in other words, that's a description, not at the time at which there must be the express acceptance, but the time at which the constituent parties who have to give their consent are counted.
12	p2,00:51:20.810,00:53:49.170,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Lord Collins' -- Lord Justice Lawrence's, at paragraph 53 on page 11. It is plain that Article 12 (1) (b) of Brussels II Revised when it speaks to the jurisdiction being quote, except expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized is not simply referring to a mere submission in matrimonial proceedings equivalent to what would be an entry of appearance under Brussels I Article 24. First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction to enrage the matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner. This must mean that accepting the jurisdiction of a court, other than that of a child's habitual residence, is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be [inaudible] by the parties at the time the proceedings are instituted. And then Your Lordship proceeded to recite the [inaudible] 12 to the regulation in paragraph 54. The first point, My Lord, we need to consider here, because in that case, the case turned on whether acknowledging the service effectively or whether the filing of a statement of arrangements in divorce proceedings amounted to consent. The court held not. The point I want to concentrate on is the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner, this must mean that acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be attributed by the parent at the time the proceedings are instituted. Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case.

12	p2,00:26:35.130,00:27:05.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: My submission to the court will be that it is, and may I come back to that My Lord? Because that is obviously a linked but different point. And again, towards the end of my submissions on this point, draw your attention back to the practise guide at page 12, tab 2 page 12, reminding ourselves, of course, this is only a persuasive authority, actually, it's 13. Top of the page, page 13. The question of jurisdiction is determined at the time the court is seized. Once a competent court is seized, in principle, it retains jurisdiction even if the child acquires habitual residence in another Member State during the course of the court proceeding. That, of course, is dealing with the Article 8 point and in my submission illustrates clearly the point that I've been making. Tab 2 page 13 top of the page. Now one of the factors which influenced the Court of Appeal's contrary interpretation was that it would preclude any party subsequently joined to the proceedings from having any right to refuse to accept jurisdiction. Obviously, parties can be added to the proceedings, all proceedings, not only family proceedings, and not infrequently are. And in this case, of course, the child as we've established was joined as a party to these proceedings. And Lord Justice Thorpe pointed out that if consent was confined to those parties who were parties at the outset of the proceedings, that would deprive a later joint party, in particular a child through the guardian, of the right to object to the court's jurisdiction. Well, My Lord, our response to that is, that's right, it does have that consequence, and the fact that it has that consequence does not, in our submission, in any way undermine the clear interpretation and meaning of the phrase. Parties added later cannot object, in our submission, to the jurisdiction. Although of course they can in this instance under the Children Act, invite the court not to make any order in the proceedings to which they have been joined. So we submit that Lord Justice Thorpe is right. It does have that consequence, but it is the clear consequence of the interpretation, which we say is absolutely absolutely clear on the words of the document.
12	p4,00:26:11.140,00:27:41.310,spk_1,	True	Counsel: That wasn't done in this case, and I have to say from experience it tends not to be done, save by rare first instance judges, in any case. Taking it forward if one considers the effect of Article 17 of the revised regulation. Article 17, coupled together with Article 18 provides a positive onus on judges to consider jurisdiction at the earliest possible stage and realistically, there's a limit to the scope for that to be done when proceedings are launched. And that comes to the analysis of the interplay between the different aspects of Article 12(3)(b) and that is to say accepted express or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. At the time the court is seized, it may well be that there is only one active party. The other party won't necessarily have had the chance to say anything at all. And there is a difficulty at the moment with that. It's a difficulty which some practitioners address by writing on a document acknowledging service, that acknowledgement is made subject to a challenge to jurisdiction.
12	p4,00:33:52.440,00:37:24.460,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Many years ago, this house and I'm afraid I've not put the authority before the house, considered the concept of retention in child abduction cases. It was H and S and the parties argued on the one hand, I said this house that house it was, on the one hand, the contention that retention was a continuing stage under the Hague Convention, one could pick the date that was most convenient for the parties to illustrate a point. Or in this case, a date following a contracting state entering the relevant convention. The House said no fixed terminus a quo, and one has to look at the earlier state of retention despite the word retention which carries with it a certain continuum. In this case, we suggest seizing is clear. It's got to be that early moment that the regulation doesn't give scope for any other interpretation. But an evaluation of jurisdiction will be based on material which of course will gradually grow with the progression of the proceedings. And this will be the case in every set of proceedings. It will grow first when a second party has joined in practical terms. Thus the document starting the proceedings is issued and served, and then in some proceedings, most proceedings, the party served will have the opportunity to respond. Then there will be a court appearance and then there may be submissions and there may be evidence. We suggest that there are a number of ways of looking at Article 12.3. One is to say yes, it's got to be determined at the moment of seizing with such material as may be available at the moment of seizing. So perhaps a judge who may be a judge at a very low level in a registry who receives a paper application will have to look at it and say, Well does Article 12.3 apply because there is a consent? In that case, there'd have to be a fairly radical overhaul of the way proceedings are started if people are to have the chance of accepting or not accepting. A second possibility is that which I've postulated as the rabbit pulled out of the hat. A third is to say the date is the date of seizing. One can look at material, which comes to light subsequent to that, but rather as one would in public law care proceedings. One has to look back to that particular date to see what the position was then. There's an argument that in this case, such a test would be satisfied because of the undertakings given in the relocation in proceedings.
12	p4,00:21:18.560,00:23:56.680,spk_1,	True	Counsel: If I may, well I, let me, My Lords come to that now. There are a number of possible ways that it could be read. But looking at the sub article the date of seizing is with with respect clear from the four corners of the regulation by Article 16. Looking at the instant case one approach that My Lords could have is to say, well what on the basis of all the evidence was the position of the parties at the time of seizing? There we go back leaving aside for the moment questions of variation and continuation of proceedings which are interesting to the undertaking given by the father at the time of the relocation, and he is undertaking was to return the child if called upon to do so by the court, not in these proceedings. And it could have said in these proceedings but it didn't. By the court that is the English court. The father therefore, it might be said, was inevitably and following intensive proceedings in which he had been represented, making a concession for all the world to see and one which bound him on paying a possible imprisonment to respond obediently to requests from the English court. Now My Lords the use or the continued use of undertakings in relocation cases has been the subject of much interest to practitioners and of the occasional observation by judges, including in the Court of Appeal. And it's sometimes being said that their outmoded, particularly in cases where, for example, the Hague Child Abduction Convention applies. This is not one of those cases. It might be said that in the generality of cases in which the Brussels II revised regulation applies while they are outmoded or they're a clumsy way of achieving an end if what the court really has in mind is a reservation of jurisdiction.
12	p2,00:22:13.840,00:24:14.450,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: I don't think I can add to that debate, My Lady, because I've obviously been focusing on the more contentious aspects as far as [inaudible] is concerned. And so I turn to the other two hurdles, which I have to get over and the first is that the jurisdiction the court has been expressed accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. And there are two components of that which we need to consider. And the first I want to consider is at the time the court is seized. And of course, here there is a distinction between -- the issue is, does that refer to a specific event in time, meaning when the court is first seized, or a continuum of time, such a period of time as the court is seized? The Court of Appeal held that it meant the latter. It's our submission that it means the former. Although crucially, of course, later events are relevant in determining the position at the outset of the proceedings. We rely on a number of points in support of our preferred interpretation. We submit that the word, has been, in Article 12 (3) (b), is more consistent with a specific point in time. We point to the fact that under Article eight, the same phrase is used. Articulate the basic general jurisdiction. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of principle, over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seized. It is our submission to the court that the contrary interpretation would drain any meaning or effectiveness from the articles, because the crucial purpose of a jurisdictional rule, in our submission, is to determine whether the court has jurisdiction at the start of the proceedings, so they continue to determine the issue.

13	p1,00:27:34.820,00:33:51.980,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And then the order, to just go on to the order. The order requires the father to bring the child to the jurisdiction. For contact, the following year, this June, June for 8 weeks, June, July 2009 and provides the mother to have reasonable contact with the child either as agreed or as ordered by the court with reasonable telephone contact with a child in Pakistan and the mother is at liberty to visiting and contact the child in Pakistan. The father, having assured the court that she will be safe with his family and the judgement hopefully, in my hope, is immediately behind that, my tab eight in appendix part one. I don't know what tab number it is in court bundle. The next document is that Mr Justice Headley's judgment. Now, much of this judgment is deals with issues that arose because the judge was here in person and again, I don't propose to go through it in full unless the court wishes me to do so. But he recites the history, some of the evidence he'd heard he got the -- he asked the senior CAFCASS officer in the High Court Mr Miller, to attend to help see the parties and discuss matters. He recites what Mr Miller said to him. Paragraph 17 in the judgment and then paragraph 19 he says, I have no doubt that the court ought to give further consideration as to how this case is to be managed in the long term. It being incredibly obvious to me and not the party that trying to deal with the kind of time scale attempted this time around in such a court case merely underlines the difficulties that the court is inevitably confronted with. It is also my intention to crystallise out a statement of aspiration in paragraph five of the order the 12th December 2007 by directing the attendance of K, child in this jurisdiction in 2000 and nine on the basis that is apparently un contentious between the parties. And he may not be just a holiday but returned in case, in which case the court in every needs to be involved because they would be close to the future of contact can be considered. The mothers receive an assurance from the London borough of Newham they would undertake an assessment of their capacity to have unsupervised contact, which must be her first aspiration. If that is granted, where it will lead is, of course, a matter that stretches sufficiently far in the future to be very unwise for this court to make any comment about now. And that is an assessment to which, of course you must be entitled and is in a sense, which is of course futile without the presence of the child, or at least it could be started. But it cannot be completed without the presence of the stuff -- of the child. So those are matters about which I have no doubt which I will do course reduced in due course, reduce into order form that there needs the issue about this summer I contact in summer 2008, upon which, as upon many issues, the parties remained hopelessly divided. The judge recites parties arguments Paragraph 24, 25, 26. Now I do not, for one moment underestimate the importance of this matter to the perils. On the face of it, the mother makes a perfectly reasonable application. On the face of it, the father raises not unreasonable objections to visit taking place this summer. One simply has to recognise that this is so, one also has to acknowledge that is generally desirable strongly in the interests of a child to maintain a proper relationship with both his parents, both of whom, of course, at this stage live in the United Kingdom, which he does not. And so one recognises that in the ordinary circumstances, it is perfectly reasonable that matters should take place as contemplated. There's nothing ordinary about this case at all. The relationships are vindictive, the willingness to discuss is wholly absent nobody's able to speak without making any allegations against each other, and the whole thing is hopelessly fraught. That of course immediately to ask myself, What on earth is that I'm bringing this child into if I were to require to return? And I fear that what happened last time he was here and there was an issue about what happened to him, which I won't go into whichever account one chooses to look at, whether the mother or father does nothing but add to the concerns, then he makes further comments about the parents. And then he goes on Paragraph 29. I have, of course, no power, whatever to compel anyone in Pakistan to do anything. The only power I have is to compel the mother or the father by reason of their being parents and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the court. No one else is because, of course, the child is entirely lawfully in Pakistan. And indeed it is unusual that the court should be retaining jurisdiction in this case because, of course, the child is habitually resident in Pakistan and were this a European case the court would be positively deprived of jurisdiction by the structure of European parenting law, but it is not, and the court undoubtedly does have jurisdiction because both parties have not only submitted to the jurisdiction but have actually invoked it on a number of occasions. And so the question of jurisdiction of itself does not present a problem in this case, though, of course, the question of enforcement of orders might. I've considered the implications of that paragraph on a number of occasions of recent months, and were I to remove the two references to European, then there will be no difficulty. We'll come back onto the -- come back to the interpretation, if I may, a little later. But the point I want to emphasise is that the learned judge relied in his recent conclusion, the court undoubtedly does have jurisdiction on the fact the parties have not only submitted to the jurisdiction, but had actually invoked it on a number of occasions.
13	p3,02:06:16.580,02:09:36.860,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Of course, the order of Mrs -- Mr Justice Headley had provided for the children's representatives to restore the matter back before the court once the guardian had had time to make some preliminary inquiries. The report was therefore prepared and the matter then, of course, as we know, brought back before the court in the early part of this year. But more to the relevance of that report in my submission is perhaps that at Page 13 it seems that the guardian was the first person, certainly the first party, to seemingly apply his mind to the jurisdiction of the court. He has consistently since that time flagged up with the court his concerns about the jurisdiction. Lords, a position statement filed on his behalf in February was very clear that one of the first questions that the court should be asked to consider was the question of jurisdiction. And that position statement is at Tab 18 again of Appendix 2 as I understand it. The Court: Yes. Counsel: So, it would seem to be clear on the face of the papers that the guardian has consistently raised this concern. He has been seeking the guidance of the court on the matter, and he has sought the guidance of the child's solicitor. He himself was not expressing a personal view, and to some degree, that remains, in terms of the question of jurisdiction, his position. At the hearing in May, before his Honour, Judge Barnett, the child's solicitor argued on his behalf on legal grounds that the court did not have jurisdiction. But My Lords will, of course, have seen that in fact, when it came to arguments of forum non conveniens the guardian, in fact, preferred that the matter be dealt with in this jurisdiction. From that point on, the guardian has taken the view that he was content with that decision of his Honour, Judge Barnett. So, took essentially a neutral stance in the Court of Appeal. He didn't seek to go behind that decision, and the position today is essentially that because he doesn't seek to go behind those decisions, he essentially resists the appeal. But it isn't perhaps at first blush, the most straightforward position.

13	p2,01:02:18.080,01:03:23.320,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: And in this case we're looking at a child's welfare, several years on into the proceedings. This point was considered, actually, My Lord, by Mr Justice Hedley in another case, the case of C v C, which is at tab 25 in the authority. So in my copy, that's volume two of the authority, tab 25. It is reported somewhere that we've got the [inaudible] report, and this is about a case in which a mother had been given permission to remove a child to Spain. A lot of the cases involve Spain. And the father subsequently brought further proceedings in England for contact with the child. Paragraph 12, the father's counsel says this. He says at all times, up to a letter, last summer, the mother fully participated in the proceedings. At all material times she was representative, took no issue on jurisdiction, even though the children must have been habitually resident in Spain for many months. It is true that the wording is in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized. That cannot, he contends, be narrowly construed since at the time of being seized, the issue of an application, a respondent may well have no knowledge of the matter. He submits to the court, absent express acceptance and has agreed that there is none here. Must look at the litigation, conduct and draw inferences from it. He estimated there is only one inference here, and that is now too late to object to jurisdiction of this current matter. Paragraph 16, halfway down the page, halfway down the paragraph, line seven, given that Miss Harding cannot challenge the fact on the mother's participation in the proceeding, she's for the mother, including an application whilst acting in person for an extension of time, the question can be further refined, and I think this is My Lord's point, can the mother be said to have accepted jurisdiction in an unequivocal map if she had never appreciated that it was able to challenge. It is that question that I'm required to answer. It would be unreal to think that the question of jurisdiction has never occurred to anyone. And I interject that in this case we know that it had. That said, however, I do accept Miss Harding's submission that no one ever saw it as a problem, and thus the mother did not specifically address in her mind an objection to it. In my judgement, the fundamental approach to this should be, what inference should be drawn from the mother's litigation conduct? The answer to that is clear. Complete acceptance. Then one should ask whether a failure to address the question of challenge vitiates what otherwise appears to be an unequivocal acceptance. I do not think it does. This case demonstrates a clear acceptance of the court's jurisdiction at least until late 2006, by which time, at any [inaudible] the court must be seized with the matter. Accordingly, it is then too late to object. In my judgement, the evidence demonstrates unequivocal participation in the proceedings and thus an acceptance of the jurisdiction. I do not think that the absence, as I'm prepared to accept it was, of advice on her right to object should vitiate the unequivocal acceptance otherwise is damaged. I'm glad to reach that view in this case, as questions of jurisdiction should be resolved at the outset of the case are not on the eve of the final hearing. That point of policy also fortifies my view that the court should be looking at what the partners have actually done, rather than the reasons or lack of them for doing it absent, of course, for misrepresentation. So that's the view of an extremely experienced judgment at first instance, addresses the very point Your Lordship was making.
13	p2,00:26:35.130,00:27:05.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: My submission to the court will be that it is, and may I come back to that My Lord? Because that is obviously a linked but different point. And again, towards the end of my submissions on this point, draw your attention back to the practise guide at page 12, tab 2 page 12, reminding ourselves, of course, this is only a persuasive authority, actually, it's 13. Top of the page, page 13. The question of jurisdiction is determined at the time the court is seized. Once a competent court is seized, in principle, it retains jurisdiction even if the child acquires habitual residence in another Member State during the course of the court proceeding. That, of course, is dealing with the Article 8 point and in my submission illustrates clearly the point that I've been making. Tab 2 page 13 top of the page. Now one of the factors which influenced the Court of Appeal's contrary interpretation was that it would preclude any party subsequently joined to the proceedings from having any right to refuse to accept jurisdiction. Obviously, parties can be added to the proceedings, all proceedings, not only family proceedings, and not infrequently are. And in this case, of course, the child as we've established was joined as a party to these proceedings. And Lord Justice Thorpe pointed out that if consent was confined to those parties who were parties at the outset of the proceedings, that would deprive a later joint party, in particular a child through the guardian, of the right to object to the court's jurisdiction. Well, My Lord, our response to that is, that's right, it does have that consequence, and the fact that it has that consequence does not, in our submission, in any way undermine the clear interpretation and meaning of the phrase. Parties added later cannot object, in our submission, to the jurisdiction. Although of course they can in this instance under the Children Act, invite the court not to make any order in the proceedings to which they have been joined. So we submit that Lord Justice Thorpe is right. It does have that consequence, but it is the clear consequence of the interpretation, which we say is absolutely absolutely clear on the words of the document.
13	p3,01:38:30.700,01:38:55.250,spk_2,	True	The Court: One possibility is one actually has an express written agreement between the parties at some earlier stage. Let's assume it was there in September 2004, one had actually a document which they both signed saying, We accept the jurisdiction of the English courts in regard to our parental responsibility and in regard to this child. Not tied to any particular proceedings it's just simply accepting the jurisdiction of the court.

13	p2,00:58:15.120,00:58:19.440,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Exactly. He subsequently submitted an application to have that set aside. And then the position statements which we looked at earlier, which he says, the court has retained jurisdiction and the father accepts the court's jurisdiction. Although adding a rider about the enforceability of any orders made. Now in our submission, contrary to the -- with respect to Lord Justice Thorpe's analysis -- Lord Justice Thorpe said when the judge individually or cumulatively, I'm quite unpersuaded anything the father has done within this jurisdiction amounts to an unequivocal acceptance. It's our submission, we don't invite the courts to look at the Acts individually, but to look at them cumulatively in the context of the undertaking given in 2004. And we submit that it is manifestly unequivocal acceptance. It's only very, very late in the day that he seeks to challenge jurisdiction. Prior to doing so, he's given an undertaking to the Court to return the child to the Court, if ordered to do so by the Court. He submitted to at least two defined contact orders. His father position statement saying, I accept the court has jurisdiction, and he's made an application to the court himself.
13	p1,00:48:26.700,00:49:05.200,spk_0,	True	Counsel: He seeks to set aside or discharge the order, requiring him to bring the child to the jurisdiction that summer, effectively. So he is seeking -- he invokes the jurisdiction of the court to vary the order made by Mr Justice Headley the previous year, and the reason he does so is set out at paragraph five for the reasons set out in the applicant's position statement in this matter which we just looked at, well we haven't looked at all of it but that's the document.

13	p3,00:52:33.560,00:53:27.980,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I would ask, however, that the court considered whether his participation -- the manner of his participation can be equated with unequivocal consent. And this is how I would put it. I would start by saying that he has attended court on at least three occasions when he was ordered to do so rather than because he was seeking the jurisdiction of the court to be exercised himself. And he attended court on those occasions and they can be seen by the orders that were made by the court. First of all, at tab 28 which is the order of the 31st of October 2007.
13	p2,00:51:20.810,00:53:49.170,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Lord Collins' -- Lord Justice Lawrence's, at paragraph 53 on page 11. It is plain that Article 12 (1) (b) of Brussels II Revised when it speaks to the jurisdiction being quote, except expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized is not simply referring to a mere submission in matrimonial proceedings equivalent to what would be an entry of appearance under Brussels I Article 24. First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction to enrage the matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner. This must mean that accepting the jurisdiction of a court, other than that of a child's habitual residence, is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be [inaudible] by the parties at the time the proceedings are instituted. And then Your Lordship proceeded to recite the [inaudible] 12 to the regulation in paragraph 54. The first point, My Lord, we need to consider here, because in that case, the case turned on whether acknowledging the service effectively or whether the filing of a statement of arrangements in divorce proceedings amounted to consent. The court held not. The point I want to concentrate on is the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner, this must mean that acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be attributed by the parent at the time the proceedings are instituted. Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case.
14	p4,00:55:21.360,00:56:51.150,spk_1,	True	Counsel: It is very hard to think My Lord, although no doubt it's not beyond those who are in this court, of a children's case in which, following taking up of jurisdiction on this application of Article 12.3 if that view prevails, someone comes along on behalf of the child and makes a submission that the jurisdiction is not in the child's best interest on other than a factual basis, which needs to be translated into some practical arrangement. Even if it is only that, for example, the child could not be transported should not be transported to this country. It's not in the child's best interests. Or that there is some particular reason why it is not in the child's best interests to engage in an English process or some particular work needs to be done in the other jurisdiction. The English court could then say so and say in that event, we're not going to make orders. And in accordance with the principal of Article 12, subsequent litigation should take place in the country of habitual residence. The exception no longer applies. That's one way of doing it, which might very well be ECJ compliant because it would follow so closely on the reasoning of the regulation itself.
14	p2,01:20:11.990,01:21:27.830,Judge,	True	The Court: The real question in these proceedings is, Should this child come to this country to see mum, ensured that in due course, be capable of developing into unsupervised contact with the child? That is the issue to which the proceedings are directed. It's perfectly possible that a judge hearing that issue will say, for a variety of reasons, whatever my view about what would in theory be best, I think that it would be the best interests of this child if I do not make any order on that topic for a variety of reasons, it could be partly because of the difficulties of enforcement, partly because there are other proceedings going on in Pakistan or whatever. Partly because there are things that he doesn't know. There are all sorts of reasons why one might not make an order. It's not like ordinary civil proceedings where you have to decide one way or the other what the answer is. I think that's the difference between children proceedings and other proceedings. It's a different set of issues at the time than the issue about whether it's in the interest of the child for this particular court, at least to hear the case.
14	p4,00:49:06.770,00:50:13.820,spk_1,	True	Counsel: But if there is a capacity of the English court on a best interests basis to transfer a child and a jurisdiction to another country, why shouldn't it in the discretion of the judge be exercised in a way, I must be careful, that might by coincidence be analogous to that provided in Article 15. There's nothing in the English jurisdiction to prevent it. That is a refinement of my learned friend Mr Baker's no order approach, but only a refinement in a small way because arguably when an English court returns a child in a non Convention abduction case, it is saying we are not making orders in this jurisdiction. Save orders which facilitate a return for litigation to the other jurisdiction.
14	p2,01:11:14.660,01:12:29.440,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: At every time. And of course it is, My Lord Clarke was quite right to remind me, the jurisdiction of the courts. The jurisdiction is in the best interests of the child. But that is very close to asking the welfare question, and it cannot be right in my submission at all points for the court to consider the welfare question in order to determine whether it has jurisdiction, since the point of establishing jurisdiction is to carry out the welfare exercise. In this case, of course, we're dealing with a country that isn't Pakistan that is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, and consequently, 12 (4) comes into play, and here we move into an element of some uncharted waters, an interpretation which we put forward without authority for discussion. This contains a deeming provision, where the child has habitual residence in the territory of a third state, which is not a contracting party of the Hague Convention, jurisdiction under this Article shall be deemed to be in the child's interest.

14	p2,00:42:53.900,00:44:41.110,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: It does. I was going to go through Article 15 as it clearly is of interest. By way of exception, I underline that, where the Courts Member State having jurisdiction, so it's after jurisdiction is established, as to the substance of a matter, may, if they consider that a Court of another Member State with which the court has a particular connection, I'm underlining words which may be of interest to have a longer discussion about this, will be at a better place to hear the case, or a specific part thereof, and where this is in the best interest of the child, stay the case or the part thereof, and invite the parties to introduce a request or request a court of another Member State to assume jurisdiction according to paragraph 5. Paragraph 1 should apply upon the application from a party or if the courts are in motion, or upon the application from a court of another Member State with which the child has a particular connection in accordance with paragraph 3. A transfer made of the Court's own motion or the application of a court of a Member State must be accepted by at least one of the parties, so you can't do it if all the parties are against. The child shall be considered to have a particular connection, if -- there is a list of five factors in three. Four, the court of a Member State, having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter shall set a time limit by which the courts of that other Member State shall be seized in accordance with paragraph 1. If the courts are not seized by that time, the court which has been seized shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. In other words, if they refused the request or don't comply with the time limit, then the Court, the requesting Court, shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in the Court, 8 to 14. The courts of that other Member State may, due to the circumstance of the case, that this is in the best interests of the child, accept within six weeks of their seizure in accordance with paragraphs 1 (a) or (b). In this case, the Court first seized shall decline jurisdiction. Otherwise, the court first seized shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. The courts shall cooperate for the purposes of the Article. That's, in my submission, quite a complex framework for what I call consensual transfer from one court to another. It follows on, but in greater detail, the provisions of Article 10 of the 96 Convention to which which we looked at earlier. It's not the same as the English Court saying, I don't think this court is the best court. I'm going to stay the proceedings on the assumption the proceedings will be transferred to a non Member State.

What it is is a court in the United Kingdom having assumed jurisdiction and having heard from everybody with an interest in the welfare of the child, applying Section 1 of the Children Act, i.e. that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration, deciding that in the particular facts and circumstances of the case, it is in the best interests of the child for the UK court to make no order. It's not transferring jurisdiction to Pakistan, it's not conceding jurisdiction.

14	p4,00:43:22.000,00:45:14.040,spk_1,	True	Counsel: It goes without saying that a high premium will be placed on establishing what the best interests of the child are in the subsequent domestic proceedings held under that jurisdiction. And so, of course, it will always be in this country. So after the jurisdiction has been accepted, there will be ample opportunity in the proceedings for dare I say it, absolutely anything to be done which the child's best interests required. The principal English statute on children's matters, the Children Act 1989, is an exceedingly flexible statute, and apart from the dividing line between the public law and private law fields it is hard to think of an order which cannot be made under the Children Act 1989 under the guise of under the umbrella of Section 8 or otherwise, which would be required to meet a child's best interests. Is there a power to review jurisdiction? Because it's my learned friend's submission that in order properly to give weight to the views of the child and the interests of the child, it's not acceptable that there should be a snapshot taken at a time when the child is not represented. And then the child comes along and the child has nothing that he or she can say about jurisdiction. One looks My Lords at Article 15.

14	p3,00:18:30.290,00:21:17.440,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Which is, what should be considered to be in the child's interest. The presumption being that if the member state in which the child is habitually resident is not a contracting party to the Hague Convention then it's presumed to be in the child's interests. It's presumed to be in the child's interest for the country favoured by and agreed on by the parents because the only use throughout this document for a third state on the construction that is being put to you, My Lords, on behalf of the appellant, is that there is one situation where this regulation would apply to non-contracting countries and that is if the parents or the parties choose that it should. And in no other circumstance would it be, would it apply to third countries or to non-contracting countries if I can use that term. That in itself, I think, is a curiosity. But I think that what and what we're trying to suggest to you, is that if you look at the construction of Article 12 in its entirety, the parties that are essentially referred to are parties first of all, to a marriage and parties who are parents to a child upon which some decision is going to be made with reference to parental responsibility. Now we would say that if it would not be unusual or unheard of for the parents to be living in separate states themselves, and that there may be three states involved and that it is for that reason, that the third state is referred to. So for example, and I mean one can only give examples, the parents may both live in Belgium, the father may spend a lot of his time in France, and the child may live with grandparents in Germany and they choose France to be the country that they want the matter to be heard for matters of convenience or matters that are important to them. They choose it, they choose it unequivocally. They go to the court and say, We wholeheartedly want this court to deal with it. And that that is where the third state comes in. And I would say that Article 6(1), if you accept my construction of third, capital S, State supports what I'm saying.

14	p3,01:52:53.920,01:54:01.110,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It would not be right, for example, to presume that because the child is living in, even though Article 12(4) suggest is that because a child is living in a non-Convention non-Hague Convention country ipso facto therefore, it must be in the child's best interest. Best interests are not the same as interest. And there is also the question of the ability of the court to look at questions regarding the child's best interests and how that could be done in a way that is in keeping with that child's best interests. For example, I would say in this case it may not necessarily be, and it's not something I'm asking My Lords or My Lady to make a decision about. But in this case, one may say quite strongly that it can't possibly be in this child's best interest to be brought over to this country to be assessed when in fact he's been living for most of his life with his grandparents in Pakistan, and that's an example.
14	p3,00:27:59.680,00:30:29.540,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It seems, if I can elaborate what I'm saying at the moment, my Lord, I think it might explain what I'm trying to say about the incongruity of Article 12 being the only situation in which it would be considered apposite for parents to choose jurisdiction even if the child is not living within that jurisdiction and that is that part of the raison d'etre behind the regulation is the enforcement of judgments and the recognition of judgments. And if parents choose to deal with a country, whatever the country is be it Pakistan, be it United States of America, be it the Ukraine where the child lives, be it Jamaica. One can think of many countries that have very close connections with this country where children quite often live long term with extended family members, either after public law proceedings or within private law proceedings. And the parents choose this country or another country within the United -- within the European Union to be the jurisdiction to hear the case, when it's patently obvious that the other court may not neither recognise the judgment nor enforce it. And how that supports the generality and the specific desire of this aim, I think is the proper term of the regulation, which is also set out in the guidance, it's hard to explain and I think is incongruent, because even if enforcement is not the main priority, it's certainly a priority, and for parents to be able to choose not to have a case heard where their child is living and nothing can be done about the result, whatever the result is, even if it's the right result in inverted commas, seems to be totally outside the aims of this regulation.

15	p2,01:20:11.990,01:21:27.830,Judge,	True	The Court: The real question in these proceedings is, should this child come to this country to see mum, ensured that in due course, be capable of developing into unsupervised contact with the child? That is the issue to which the proceedings are directed. It's perfectly possible that a judge hearing that issue will say, for a variety of reasons, whatever my view about what would in theory be best, I think that it would be the best interests of this child if I do not make any order on that topic for a variety of reasons, it could be partly because of the difficulties of enforcement, partly because there are other proceedings going on in Pakistan or whatever. Partly because there are things that he doesn't know. There are all sorts of reasons why one might not make an order. It's not like ordinary civil proceedings where you have to decide one way or the other what the answer is. I think that's the difference between children proceedings and other proceedings. It's a different set of issues at the time than the issue about whether it's in the interest of the child for this particular court, at least to hear the case.
15	p4,00:49:06.770,00:50:13.820,spk_1,	True	Counsel: But if there is a capacity of the English court on a best interests basis to transfer a child and a jurisdiction to another country, why shouldn't it in the discretion of the judge be exercised in a way, I must be careful, that might by coincidence be analogous to that provided in Article 15. There's nothing in the English jurisdiction to prevent it. That is a refinement of my learned friend Mr Baker's no order approach, but only a refinement in a small way because arguably when an English court returns a child in a non Convention abduction case, it is saying we are not making orders in this jurisdiction. Save orders which facilitate a return for litigation to the other jurisdiction.

15	p2,00:36:54.980,00:37:24.070,Judge,	True	The Court: It isn't the same result with respect. It isn't. What it is is a court in the United Kingdom having assumed jurisdiction and having heard from everybody with an interest in the welfare of the child, applying Section 1 of the Children Act, i.e. that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration, deciding that in the particular facts and circumstances of the case, it is in the best interests of the child for the UK court to make no order. It's not transferring jurisdiction to Pakistan, it's not conceding jurisdiction.
15	p1,00:27:34.820,00:33:51.980,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And then the order, to just go on to the order. The order requires the father to bring the child to the jurisdiction. For contact, the following year, this June, June for 8 weeks, June, July 2009 and provides the mother to have reasonable contact with the child either as agreed or as ordered by the court with reasonable telephone contact with a child in Pakistan and the mother is at liberty to visiting and contact the child in Pakistan. The father, having assured the court that she will be safe with his family and the judgement hopefully, in my hope, is immediately behind that, my tab eight in appendix part one. I don't know what tab number it is in court bundle. The next document is that Mr Justice Headley's judgment. Now, much of this judgment is deals with issues that arose because the judge was here in person and again, I don't propose to go through it in full unless the court wishes me to do so. But he recites the history, some of the evidence he'd heard he got the -- he asked the senior CAFCASS officer in the High Court Mr Miller, to attend to help see the parties and discuss matters. He recites what Mr Miller said to him. Paragraph 17 in the judgment and then paragraph 19 he says, I have no doubt that the court ought to give further consideration as to how this case is to be managed in the long term. It being incredibly obvious to me and not the party that trying to deal with the kind of time scale attempted this time around in such a court case merely underlines the difficulties that the court is inevitably confronted with. It is also my intention to crystallise out a statement of aspiration in paragraph five of the order the 12th December 2007 by directing the attendance of K, child in this jurisdiction in 2000 and nine on the basis that is apparently un contentious between the parties. And he may not be just a holiday but returned in case, in which case the court in every needs to be involved because they would be close to the future of contact can be considered. The mothers receive an assurance from the London borough of Newham they would undertake an assessment of their capacity to have unsupervised contact, which must be her first aspiration. If that is granted, where it will lead is, of course, a matter that stretches sufficiently far in the future to be very unwise for this court to make any comment about now. And that is an assessment to which, of course you must be entitled and is in a sense, which is of course futile without the presence of the child, or at least it could be started. But it cannot be completed without the presence of the stuff -- of the child. So those are matters about which I have no doubt which I will do course reduced in due course, reduce into order form that there needs the issue about this summer I contact in summer 2008, upon which, as upon many issues, the parties remained hopelessly divided. The judge recites parties arguments Paragraph 24, 25, 26. Now I do not, for one moment underestimate the importance of this matter to the perils. On the face of it, the mother makes a perfectly reasonable application. On the face of it, the father raises not unreasonable objections to visit taking place this summer. One simply has to recognise that this is so, one also has to acknowledge that is generally desirable strongly in the interests of a child to maintain a proper relationship with both his parents, both of whom, of course, at this stage live in the United Kingdom, which he does not. And so one recognises that in the ordinary circumstances, it is perfectly reasonable that matters should take place as contemplated. There's nothing ordinary about this case at all. The relationships are vindictive, the willingness to discuss is wholly absent nobody's able to speak without making any allegations against each other, and the whole thing is hopelessly fraught. That of course immediately to ask myself, What on earth is that I'm bringing this child into if I were to require to return? And I fear that what happened last time he was here and there was an issue about what happened to him, which I won't go into whichever account one chooses to look at, whether the mother or father does nothing but add to the concerns, then he makes further comments about the parents. And then he goes on Paragraph 29. I have, of course, no power, whatever to compel anyone in Pakistan to do anything. The only power I have is to compel the mother or the father by reason of their being parents and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the court. No one else is because, of course, the child is entirely lawfully in Pakistan. And indeed it is unusual that the court should be retaining jurisdiction in this case because, of course, the child is habitually resident in Pakistan and were this a European case the court would be positively deprived of jurisdiction by the structure of European parenting law, but it is not, and the court undoubtedly does have jurisdiction because both parties have not only submitted to the jurisdiction but have actually invoked it on a number of occasions. And so the question of jurisdiction of itself does not present a problem in this case, though, of course, the question of enforcement of orders might. I've considered the implications of that paragraph on a number of occasions of recent months, and were I to remove the two references to European, then there will be no difficulty. We'll come back onto the -- come back to the interpretation, if I may, a little later. But the point I want to emphasise is that the learned judge relied in his recent conclusion, the court undoubtedly does have jurisdiction on the fact the parties have not only submitted to the jurisdiction, but had actually invoked it on a number of occasions.

15	p4,00:55:21.360,00:56:51.150,spk_1,	True	Counsel: It is very hard to think My Lord, although no doubt it's not beyond those who are in this court, of a children's case in which, following taking up of jurisdiction on this application of Article 12.3 if that view prevails, someone comes along on behalf of the child and makes a submission that the jurisdiction is not in the child's best interest on other than a factual basis, which needs to be translated into some practical arrangement. Even if it is only that, for example, the child could not be transported should not be transported to this country. It's not in the child's best interests. Or that there is some particular reason why it is not in the child's best interests to engage in an English process or some particular work needs to be done in the other jurisdiction. The English court could then say so and say in that event, we're not going to make orders. And in accordance with the principal of Article 12, subsequent litigation should take place in the country of habitual residence. The exception no longer applies. That's one way of doing it, which might very well be ECJ compliant because it would follow so closely on the reasoning of the regulation itself.

My lords will be keenly aware by now of the references to nationality in the revised regulation, founded on nationality alone in relation to children physically present in some other jurisdiction. In these dire and exceptional circumstances, the tentacles of the court could stretch towards Pakistan to rescue a girl who was and always had been a British child and who was seeking British help. It would not been right to ignore her pleas. Each case would turn on its own circumstances only if the circumstances were sufficiently dire and exceptional would such an unusual order be made. Well, I can tell my Lords that it is indeed exceptional for the parens patriae jurisdiction to be used, but there are cases where it is still used. Could it be that the Brussels regulation with its interest in nationality is one which is capable of providing a refuge of jurisdiction for its citizens in the way that by different routes the English jurisdiction provided a now almost disused parens patriae jurisdiction. My Lords I will move on from there.

Lord Justice Thorpe, paragraph 33 [inaudible] emphasise that prorogation [inaudible] in a huge majority of cases [inaudible] to international planning law, it takes horrendous [inaudible] save exceptional circumstances, the habitual residence of the child dictates which state holds the primary jurisdiction. Nationality [inaudible] should not alter [inaudible] from that approach. In our very considerable deviance from Pakistan, we are highly dependant upon the [inaudible] immigration law, which was signed by the senior judiciary of the two jurisdictions in January 2003. There are approximately a million British nationals of Pakistani origin in this jurisdiction. Conflicted cases between this jurisdiction and Pakistan passed through my office at the rate of approximately once a fortnight. I interject here, [inaudible] of course, as the court will know, Lord Justice [inaudible] was the head of international justice, I think that was the context in which I make the observation. In the vast majority of cases, we were pleading with the judges in Pakistan to recognise that welfare decisions belong to and are the responsibility of the courts of the child of British residence. I suggest that although the protocol is largely directed to cases of wrongful removal or retention, the principal stated in the first paragraph is of general application. In all the circumstances [inaudible] habitually resident. We can hardly expect the judges at the start to honour the protocol beyond the immediate territory of [inaudible] if we lay [inaudible] to the claim to jurisdiction in relation to children who are essentially Pakistani.

16	p2,01:28:38.790,01:29:08.850,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Well, quite. First point. Second point, the protocol itself doesn't talk about it being the invariable, it's the normal circumstances, and that is entirely consistent with the European jurisprudence and the regulation. We tentatively raise this question. Is it appropriate for a court interpreting English law, which is what regulation is, to do so in the light of, or by having regard to the importance of a protocol signed by the judiciary of two countries. It's been observed and we've given the references in paragraph 85, there's been some concern about the legal status of the protocol. I'm not sure whether this court will want to delve too deeply into that question. We accept that the protocol plays an important part, practical role, in regulating and assisting in relations between the courts of the two countries. But it's a non legislative agreement between members of the judiciary, and should not, in our submission, be invoked to determine the construction and application of English law. The consequence would be that one group of litigants, those who are relying on Pakistani courts to respect jurisdiction based on habitual residence, are favoured of expense of other parents who wish to choose the English court under the prorogation paths in Article 12. And furthermore, we say it risks putting the courts of this country at odds with the rest of Europe, thereby defeating the principal aim of the regulation.
16	p4,01:02:45.890,01:04:21.080,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Absolutely. They were present. But it's an informal judicial protocol. The way this arrangement would be complementary would be this. That if it were to be the case that an English court decided by coincidental analogy to Article 15 to transfer part of the jurisdiction. The Pakistan Protocol with its judicial links would provide an ideal way for this to be considered and so far from driving what Convention terms as we call a coach and four through the Pakistani Protocol. This interpretation would be consistent with the spirit of cooperation, which is at that protocol's heart. But to talk about the policy of the Pakistan Protocol and to suggest that that should impede a particular result in the case of a particular individual child, the risk of criticising an eminent judge in the Court of Appeal may be going too far. It may not be an appropriate consideration, but as it happens, we say that the objectives of the Pakistan protocol are probably assisted and certainly can be exploited in this interpretation. Lords, I've taken up a great deal of the court's time.

Dismissing an appeal against the decision of his honour Judge Barlett, sitting as a judge of the family division whereby he held the court did not have jurisdiction to entertain applications under the Children Act for orders assessing and defining contact between our client, the mother and the parties' only child, Q, who is now aged nine years of age. Permission was granted -- it was refused to appear, permission to appear was refused by the Court of Appeal but granted by this court, I think on the 28th of September. Could I just my Lord mention one or two preliminary matters? First of all, we are extremely grateful to the court for accommodating this case, this appeal so quickly. Of course, as a children's case, it is a matter of some urgency. I hope the Lord will permit me just in particular, thank the court staff particularly I name Mrs Demanbro for the assistance that they particularly she have given us over the last few weeks in the unusual circumstances in which we found ourselves. And it's a credit to the court that they were able to provide that assistance despite or the other demand on their time in the last few weeks.
17	p3,02:06:16.580,02:09:36.860,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Of course, the order of Mrs -- Mr Justice Headley had provided for the children's representatives to restore the matter back before the court once the guardian had had time to make some preliminary inquiries. The report was therefore prepared and the matter then, of course, as we know, brought back before the court in the early part of this year. But more to the relevance of that report in my submission is perhaps that at Page 13 it seems that the guardian was the first person, certainly the first party, to seemingly apply his mind to the jurisdiction of the court. He has consistently since that time flagged up with the court his concerns about the jurisdiction. Lords, a position statement filed on his behalf in February was very clear that one of the first questions that the court should be asked to consider was the question of jurisdiction. And that position statement is at Tab 18 again of Appendix 2 as I understand it. Yes. So, it would seem to be clear on the face of the papers that the guardian has consistently raised this concern. He has been seeking the guidance of the court on the matter, and he has sought the guidance of the child's solicitor. He himself was not expressing a personal view, and to some degree, that remains, in terms of the question of jurisdiction, his position. At the hearing in May, before his Honour, Judge Barnett, the child's solicitor argued on his behalf on legal grounds that the court did not have jurisdiction. But My Lords will, of course, have seen that in fact, when it came to arguments of forum non conveniens the guardian, in fact, preferred that the matter be dealt with in this jurisdiction. From that point on, the guardian has taken the view that he was content with that decision of his Honour, Judge Barnett. So, took essentially a neutral stance in the Court of Appeal. He didn't seek to go behind that decision, and the position today is essentially that because he doesn't seek to go behind those decisions, he essentially resists the appeal. But it isn't perhaps at first blush, the most straightforward position.
17	p4,01:24:22.820,01:24:36.020,spk_5,	True	I am choosing yes for this text as there is a semantic link between the two "I agree" statements from the judgement and the "good/good enough agreement" from the text from transcripts.   The Court: If you don't make a good enough agreement the first time there's no reason why you shouldn't make one later, since there's nothing about time on this analysis in the Article. But suppose by this time the child is a party. Would it never they nevertheless be a good agreement?

17	p1,01:18:54.810,01:20:10.580,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Well, we don't have to, but reverting then to my submissions, but looking at the flowchart, the court asked, Do I have jurisdiction to consider the general rule, general being habitual residence of the child. Yes, I have jurisdiction. If no, do I have jurisdiction to Articles 9 to 10, 12 or 13? If yes, I have jurisdiction. If no, does another court in another member state have jurisdiction over the regulation after 17? If yes, this is Lady Lady Hale's point, I must declare of my own motion that I do not have jurisdiction. It's only the answer to all those questions is no that the court that no court is competent under the regulation and in those circumstances, either judge can exercise any jurisdiction available under my national law, the residual law. So the effect of the regulation is in my submission quite radical because it is confined, the domestic rules about jurisdiction to the very relatively narrow circumstances in which none of those questions is answered yes.

18	p2,00:10:06.940,00:10:18.890,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Now, Dr Borrás' commentary about this is quite interesting, at tab 9 in the same bundle. This is Dr Borrás' report, in case it is not clear, is the explanatory report prepared for the Convention, we jumped ahead of this this morning, but before initially, the plan was that the new EU rules and procedures about jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of matrimonial cases, was to be the subject of a convention rather than a regulation. But in the event, the draft convention was converted into a regulation. I'm sure I use inelegant and inaccurate language, but that's what happened. This report is an explanatory report for the convention that became the regulation, Brussels II, Dr Borrás'. And can I ask you, please, turn to page 12 and 13, and beginning at paragraph 35 you see a heading, parental responsibility. Paragraph 35 simply recites paraphrases Article 3 of Brussels II. And then she says this, paragraph 36. The structure and content of this provision are the product of difficult negotiation, both within the community and in relation to worldwide provisions, particularly the 1996 Hague Convention. The fact that the community Convention limits itself to children habitually resident in the Member State facilitates its compatibility with the Hague Convention. The agreement between the Member States to include this matter within the scope of the Convention simply transferred the problem to the establishment of grounds for jurisdiction. Since while there were no problems where the child is habitually resident in the State as authorities have jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings, the same does not apply to cases where the child is habitually resident in another Member State. The problem is further complicated by the fact that Article 52 (2) of the Hague Convention provides that the Convention does not affect the possibility of one or more contracting States to conclude agreements which contain, in respect of children habitually resident in any of the States parties to such agreements, provisions on matters governed by that Convention. As a result, where both Conventions are in force -- remember, by both Conventions, she means Hague and the anticipated Brussels Convention. The Convention to which this report relates will take precedence in respect of children resident in Member States of the EU which are party to it. Whereas the Hague Convention will apply to other cases. There are no problems in relation to Article 3 (1), which establishes jurisdiction in the matter relating to parental responsibility over a child of both spouses where the child is habitually resident in the Member State, whose authorities also exercise jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings. It needs to be made clear that in no case does that provision mean that it must be the same authority in the State concerned to rule on the matrimonial and the parental responsibility. The rule is intended not only to establish that the authorities deciding on both matters are authorities of the same State. In practise, they will be the same authorities in some States and separate authorities in others. For the purpose of the Convention, the only point of interest is that they'd be authorities of the same Member State with due regard for internal distribution of competence. Paragraph 2 sets out the conditions under which the authorities of the Member State exercising jurisdiction on the divorce also have jurisdiction to decide parental responsibility, where the child is resident, not in that State but in another Member State. Both the following conditions have to be met. At least one of the spouses must have responsibility in relation to the child, and the jurisdiction of the courts must be accepted by the spouses and must be in the best interests of the child. This provision is taken from Article 10 (1) of the 1996 Hague Convention, which guarantees that there is no contradiction between Article 3 (2) of the Convention under discussion and the relevant provisions of the Hague Convention. The relevant provision of the Hague convention is practically the same thing, the only difference being that, in addition to requiring that one of the parents has responsibility, it also requires that at the time of the commencement proceedings, one of the parents habitually resides in that state. The difference derives from the differing subject matters of the two Conventions. The Hague Convention deals with the protection of children, whereas the Convention to which this report relates deals in matrimonial matters and for that reason the parents connection with the territory of a State for the purpose of determining jurisdiction in matrimonial matters is determined by the grounds set out in Article 2. Article 3 (2) is designed to cover one particular situation in which the best solution is to use the same grounds of the Hague Convention. So the important point is that, according to Dr Borrás, the terms of the original Brussels II regulation in this regard, were effectively designed to facilitate compatibility with the Hague Convention.

The first question to be considered under Article 12 is whether the power to prorogue jurisdiction extends to children who are habitually resident in a state that is not a member state of the EU. The rationale for Article 12 is to provide an exception to the general rule. The jurisdiction matters of PR has converged on the member state of the child's habitual residence. Article 12, as well already identified provides two powers of propagation in matters of parental possibility. One in matrimonial, the other in non matrimonial proceedings. This case concerns a non matrimonial case.

The jurisdiction is in the best interests of the child. But that is very close to asking the welfare question, and it cannot be right in my submission at all points for the court to consider the welfare question in order to determine whether it has jurisdiction, since the point of establishing jurisdiction is to carry out the welfare exercise. In this case, of course, we're dealing with a country that isn't Pakistan that is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, and consequently, 12 (4) comes into play, and here we move into an element of some uncharted waters, an interpretation which we put forward without authority for discussion. This contains a deeming provision, where the child has habitual residence in the territory of a third state, which is not a contracting party of the Hague Convention, jurisdiction under this Article shall be deemed to be in the child's interest.

18	p1,01:37:11.450,01:38:39.850,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The first issue arising is whether that power is confined as his contended on behalf of the father, to children who are habitually resident within the EU or extends to all children. As we contend. If that construction is correct, jurisdiction could be [inaudible] to cover Q. Provided the criteria Article 12 for you are satisfied before I turn to the question of third State. Could I just invite the court to look at Article 12 (3) and its predecessor. Article 12 (3), which you have open in front of you, reads, well, the first part of it reads, The courts of a member state should also have jurisdiction in relation to proceedings other than those referred to in paragraph 1. Now its predecessor was -- I realised I've also not in the course of the argument gone through the history of the Brussels regulations, that is set out in full in my document, I assume I needn't do that.
18	p1,00:58:10.620,01:00:10.740,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Yes, if you look at tab -- just to try and make it less unclear. Tab 10 contains the version of the Family Law Act 1986. It was enforced before the 2005 amendment, which was implemented to take account of Brussels II revised, as we will go on to consider later. And the court knows, Brussels II revised is the successor to an early regulation Brussels II, and this previous version of the Family Law Act 1986 was had itself been amended with itself is out of an earlier amendment to take account of the earlier regulation. So when, when we see paragraph two on page four of the document, tab 10, Section 2 reads, then read as follows, that is immediately prior to April 2005, A court in England and Wales shall not have jurisdiction to make a Section 1 (1)(a) order with respect to a child in or in connection with matrimonial proceedings in England and Wales. Unless, a, a child concerned is the child of both parties to the matrimonial proceedings and the court has jurisdiction to entertain these proceedings by virtue of the council regulation, which, of course, is Brussels II. Or, b, the condition in Section 2 A of this Act satisfied. A court in England and Wales shall only have jurisdiction to make a Section 1 (1)(a) order in a non matrimonial case, that is to say, where the condition in Section 2(a) of the act is not satisfied unless the condition in Section 3 of this act is satisfied. And the reason for that distinction at that stage was Brussels II it was a regulation dealing with matrimonial cases and only covered issues of power and responsibility that arose in the context of such matrimonial proceedings, so.

19	p2,00:42:53.900,00:44:41.110,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: It does. I was going to go through Article 15 as it clearly is of interest. By way of exception, I underline that, where the Courts Member State having jurisdiction, so it's after jurisdiction is established, as to the substance of a matter, may, if they consider that a Court of another Member State with which the court has a particular connection, I'm underlining words which may be of interest to have a longer discussion about this, will be at a better place to hear the case, or a specific part thereof, and where this is in the best interest of the child, stay the case or the part thereof, and invite the parties to introduce a request or request a court of another Member State to assume jurisdiction according to paragraph 5. Paragraph 1 should apply upon the application from a party or if the courts are in motion, or upon the application from a court of another Member State with which the child has a particular connection in accordance with paragraph 3. A transfer made of the Court's own motion or the application of a court of a Member State must be accepted by at least one of the parties, so you can't do it if all the parties are against. The child shall be considered to have a particular connection, if -- there is a list of five factors in three. Four, the court of a Member State, having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter shall set a time limit by which the courts of that other Member State shall be seized in accordance with paragraph 1. If the courts are not seized by that time, the court which has been seized shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. In other words, if they refused the request or don't comply with the time limit, then the Court, the requesting Court, shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in the Court, 8 to 14. The courts of that other Member State may, due to the circumstance of the case, that this is in the best interests of the child, accept within six weeks of their seizure in accordance with paragraphs 1 (a) or (b). In this case, the Court first seized shall decline jurisdiction. Otherwise, the court first seized shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. The courts shall cooperate for the purposes of the Article. That's, in my submission, quite a complex framework for what I call consensual transfer from one court to another. It follows on, but in greater detail, the provisions of Article 10 of the 96 Convention to which which we looked at earlier. It's not the same as the English Court saying, I don't think this court is the best court. I'm going to stay the proceedings on the assumption the proceedings will be transferred to a non Member State.

19	p3,01:16:14.880,01:16:40.990,spk_5,	True	The Court: It's at the time the court is seized the agreement has to be -- shall we read it? The jurisdiction of the courts has been accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties at the time the court is seized. But that is an identified moment, namely October 2007. Then that is the moment at which the person, a certain jurisdiction, has to show the agreement.
19	p4,00:26:11.140,00:27:41.310,spk_1,	True	Counsel: That wasn't done in this case, and I have to say from experience it tends not to be done, save by rare first instance judges, in any case. Taking it forward if one considers the effect of Article 17 of the revised regulation. Article 17, coupled together with Article 18 provides a positive onus on judges to consider jurisdiction at the earliest possible stage and realistically, there's a limit to the scope for that to be done when proceedings are launched. And that comes to the analysis of the interplay between the different aspects of Article 12(3)(b) and that is to say accepted express or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. At the time the court is seized, it may well be that there is only one active party. The other party won't necessarily have had the chance to say anything at all. And there is a difficulty at the moment with that. It's a difficulty which some practitioners address by writing on a document acknowledging service, that acknowledgement is made subject to a challenge to jurisdiction.

19	p4,00:30:23.720,00:31:15.860,spk_1,	True	Counsel: I hope I haven't fallen flat. If one looks carefully at Article 12(3)(b) and one reads it in this way. The jurisdiction of the court has been past tense, accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner, and I'm now going to read it with an emphasis by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. So, in other words, that's a description, not at the time at which there must be the express acceptance, but the time at which the constituent parties who have to give their consent are counted.
19	p2,00:26:35.130,00:27:05.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: My submission to the court will be that it is, and may I come back to that My Lord? Because that is obviously a linked but different point. And again, towards the end of my submissions on this point, draw your attention back to the practise guide at page 12, tab 2 page 12, reminding ourselves, of course, this is only a persuasive authority, actually, it's 13. Top of the page, page 13. The question of jurisdiction is determined at the time the court is seized. Once a competent court is seized, in principle, it retains jurisdiction even if the child acquires habitual residence in another Member State during the course of the court proceeding. That, of course, is dealing with the Article 8 point and in my submission illustrates clearly the point that I've been making. Tab 2 page 13 top of the page. Now one of the factors which influenced the Court of Appeal's contrary interpretation was that it would preclude any party subsequently joined to the proceedings from having any right to refuse to accept jurisdiction. Obviously, parties can be added to the proceedings, all proceedings, not only family proceedings, and not infrequently are. And in this case, of course, the child as we've established was joined as a party to these proceedings. And Lord Justice Thorpe pointed out that if consent was confined to those parties who were parties at the outset of the proceedings, that would deprive a later joint party, in particular a child through the guardian, of the right to object to the court's jurisdiction. Well, My Lord, our response to that is, that's right, it does have that consequence, and the fact that it has that consequence does not, in our submission, in any way undermine the clear interpretation and meaning of the phrase. Parties added later cannot object, in our submission, to the jurisdiction. Although of course they can in this instance under the Children Act, invite the court not to make any order in the proceedings to which they have been joined. So we submit that Lord Justice Thorpe is right. It does have that consequence, but it is the clear consequence of the interpretation, which we say is absolutely absolutely clear on the words of the document.
19	p2,00:22:13.840,00:24:14.450,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: I don't think I can add to that debate, My Lady, because I've obviously been focusing on the more contentious aspects as far as [inaudible] is concerned. And so I turn to the other two hurdles, which I have to get over and the first is that the jurisdiction the court has been expressed accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. And there are two components of that which we need to consider. And the first I want to consider is at the time the court is seized. And of course, here there is a distinction between -- the issue is, does that refer to a specific event in time, meaning when the court is first seized, or a continuum of time, such a period of time as the court is seized? The Court of Appeal held that it meant the latter. It's our submission that it means the former. Although crucially, of course, later events are relevant in determining the position at the outset of the proceedings. We rely on a number of points in support of our preferred interpretation. We submit that the word, has been, in Article 12 (3) (b), is more consistent with a specific point in time. We point to the fact that under Article eight, the same phrase is used. Articulate the basic general jurisdiction. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of principle, over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seized. It is our submission to the court that the contrary interpretation would drain any meaning or effectiveness from the articles, because the crucial purpose of a jurisdictional rule, in our submission, is to determine whether the court has jurisdiction at the start of the proceedings, so they continue to determine the issue.

19	p4,01:24:54.920,01:25:37.450,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Yes, as a matter of construction My Lords but it's not going to rise in practise after the question of jurisdiction is presented by the court. Well, if the court has to ask itself, Have I got jurisdiction. If the court did do that in this case until very late in the day. But if it asks at the outset, do I have jurisdiction? Then one of the questions the judge has to consider is do the parties agree or have they unequivocally accepted? If they haven't unequivocally accepted, that them to the election. Do you agree? If they say no, then he doesn't have jurisdiction under Article 12(3). If they say yes, then he does, and that's the end of it.
19	p3,01:27:14.340,01:28:22.180,spk_0,	True	Counsel: That's the difficulty with having the seisure at the first moment that the court has the case in front of it with the documents and both parties. Unless there is an absolute unequivocal, Yes, we both want this. It's not just enough to say, Well you know I'm here. There it has to be unequivocal is says that. Unambiguous. It means that. And so in the face of this case, it wasn't there at the first opportunity because the only other way of imputing it would be to say later on after he had been to court several times and his counsel filed a document expressly accepting jurisdiction, that's when it's accepted. But that doesn't fit in with the provisions of the regulations, My Lords and My Lady.

It is plain that Article 12 (1) (b) of Brussels II Revised when it speaks to the jurisdiction being quote, except expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized is not simply referring to a mere submission in matrimonial proceedings equivalent to what would be an entry of appearance under Brussels I Article 24. First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction to enrage the matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner. This must mean that accepting the jurisdiction of a court, other than that of a child's habitual residence, is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be [inaudible] by the parties at the time the proceedings are instituted. And then Your Lordship proceeded to recite the [inaudible] 12 to the regulation in paragraph 54. The first point, My Lord, we need to consider here, because in that case, the case turned on whether acknowledging the service effectively or whether the filing of a statement of arrangements in divorce proceedings amounted to consent. The court held not. The point I want to concentrate on is the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner, this must mean that acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be attributed by the parent at the time the proceedings are instituted. Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case.

She says another rule related to the 1996 Hague convention is paragraph 4 of Article 12, which aims to solve what I have always considered an artificial problem. The objective of the rule is to clarify that Article 52, I think that is of the Hague Convention, doesn't affect children who do not hold habitual residence in a State party to the convention, which is obvious. However, the solution for those cases is somewhat strange because after having clarified that The Hague convention does not apply, it then adds that it will be presumed that jurisdiction under that Article is in the interest of the child, a disposition which has been qualified as an excessive exercise of community terrorisation of judicial jurisdiction related to the supposed interest of the child, then citing some other Spanish material.

20	p2,00:10:06.940,00:10:18.890,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Now, Dr Borrás' commentary about this is quite interesting, at tab 9 in the same bundle. This is Dr Borrás' report, in case it is not clear, is the explanatory report prepared for the Convention, we jumped ahead of this this morning, but before initially, the plan was that the new EU rules and procedures about jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of matrimonial cases, was to be the subject of a convention rather than a regulation. But in the event, the draft convention was converted into a regulation. I'm sure I use inelegant and inaccurate language, but that's what happened. This report is an explanatory report for the convention that became the regulation, Brussels II, Dr Borrás'. And can I ask you, please, turn to page 12 and 13, and beginning at paragraph 35 you see a heading, parental responsibility. Paragraph 35 simply recites paraphrases Article 3 of Brussels II. And then she says this, paragraph 36. The structure and content of this provision are the product of difficult negotiation, both within the community and in relation to worldwide provisions, particularly the 1996 Hague Convention. The fact that the community Convention limits itself to children habitually resident in the Member State facilitates its compatibility with the Hague Convention. The agreement between the Member States to include this matter within the scope of the Convention simply transferred the problem to the establishment of grounds for jurisdiction. Since while there were no problems where the child is habitually resident in the State as authorities have jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings, the same does not apply to cases where the child is habitually resident in another Member State. The problem is further complicated by the fact that Article 52 (2) of the Hague Convention provides that the Convention does not affect the possibility of one or more contracting States to conclude agreements which contain, in respect of children habitually resident in any of the States parties to such agreements, provisions on matters governed by that Convention. As a result, where both Conventions are in force -- remember, by both Conventions, she means Hague and the anticipated Brussels Convention. The Convention to which this report relates will take precedence in respect of children resident in Member States of the EU which are party to it. Whereas the Hague Convention will apply to other cases. There are no problems in relation to Article 3 (1), which establishes jurisdiction in the matter relating to parental responsibility over a child of both spouses where the child is habitually resident in the Member State, whose authorities also exercise jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings. It needs to be made clear that in no case does that provision mean that it must be the same authority in the State concerned to rule on the matrimonial and the parental responsibility. The rule is intended not only to establish that the authorities deciding on both matters are authorities of the same State. In practise, they will be the same authorities in some States and separate authorities in others. For the purpose of the Convention, the only point of interest is that they'd be authorities of the same Member State with due regard for internal distribution of competence. Paragraph 2 sets out the conditions under which the authorities of the Member State exercising jurisdiction on the divorce also have jurisdiction to decide parental responsibility, where the child is resident, not in that State but in another Member State. Both the following conditions have to be met. At least one of the spouses must have responsibility in relation to the child, and the jurisdiction of the courts must be accepted by the spouses and must be in the best interests of the child. This provision is taken from Article 10 (1) of the 1996 Hague Convention, which guarantees that there is no contradiction between Article 3 (2) of the Convention under discussion and the relevant provisions of the Hague Convention. The relevant provision of the Hague convention is practically the same thing, the only difference being that, in addition to requiring that one of the parents has responsibility, it also requires that at the time of the commencement proceedings, one of the parents habitually resides in that state. The difference derives from the differing subject matters of the two Conventions. The Hague Convention deals with the protection of children, whereas the Convention to which this report relates deals in matrimonial matters and for that reason the parents connection with the territory of a State for the purpose of determining jurisdiction in matrimonial matters is determined by the grounds set out in Article 2. Article 3 (2) is designed to cover one particular situation in which the best solution is to use the same grounds of the Hague Convention. So the important point is that, according to Dr Borrás, the terms of the original Brussels II regulation in this regard, were effectively designed to facilitate compatibility with the Hague Convention.
20	p2,00:19:48.640,00:21:06.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Article 12 (3) of Brussels II Revised specifies three criteria for the prorogation of jurisdiction by courts of a Member State in matters of responsibility over a child, all of which have to be satisfied, namely, one, that the child has a substantial connection with that Member State. Article 12 (3) (a). Two that the jurisdiction of the court has been accepted expressly or otherwise, in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seised. Article 12 (3) (b). And three, the jurisdictions in the best interests of the child. Article 12 (3) (b) again. Now as far as the first criterion is concerned, Article 12 (3) (a), that is manifestly satisfied, and this is not contentious because under Article 12 (3) (a) itself specifically provides that a substantial connection will be established, in particular, by virtue of the fact that one of the holders of parental responsibility is habitually resident in that Member State or the child is a national of that Member State. In this case, both of those exemplar conditions are satisfied and consequently, as agreed by all parties, the child has a substantial connection with this country.

20	p1,01:41:12.310,01:43:25.140,spk_0,	True	Counsel: No, it's not. But the point is that I succeed to make is that in those circumstances, under Article 3, there is an express reference to habitual residents. So where the child is not habitually resident in the member state, the court of that state shall have jurisdiction in such matters. If the child habitual resident in one of the member states and the test is satisfied, police are satisfied. Contrast Article 12, which of course, is headed prorogation, The courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction in divorce proceedings shall have jurisdiction in relation any matter where any parents really connected with that application, where and then the hurdles are inserted. So there is no reference, no restriction there to children who are habitually resident in one of the member states. [Pause]. And in our submission, there's no justification for reading into Article 12 (1). Or more importantly, for this case, Article 12 (3). The phrase in respect of a child who is habitually resident in a member state. I think this is a rhetorical point. If the authors had intended to limit the scope of the jurisdictional rules to cases where the trial was a fixture at the member state, given that they said so now in Brussels II we submit they surely would have done in Brussels II revised. The Court: Another way of putting that is that the commission must be presumed to be deliberate. Counsel: Yes, My Lord, and that first point --

And the comparison I wish to draw is, in fact, between the old article 3 under Brussels II and in fact, strictly, it's the matrimonial jurisdiction, article 12 (1). Because, of course, there was no equivalent to Article 12 (3) in the Brussels II regulations. So if I could invite the court to have Brussels II at tab six, Article 31 and Brussels II revised Article 12, run open and compare the two. So tab 1 to 6 Brussels II Article 31 says the courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction by virtue of article to an application for divorce and legal separation of marriage annulment shall have jurisdiction in respect, in respect of matters, respect a matter of principle, overcharging both prizes where the child is habitually resident in that member state to where the child is not a bit she resident in the member state referred to in paragraph one. Yeah, the court of that state shall have jurisdiction shut a matter if the child is in which the present in one of the member states and and then the two tests are set out. At least one of the spouses has PR, and the jurisdiction has been accepted by the spouses and is in the best interests of the child.

As we contend. If that construction is correct, jurisdiction could be [inaudible] to cover Q. Provided the criteria Article 12 for you are satisfied before I turn to the question of third State. Could I just invite the court to look at Article 12 (3) and its predecessor. Article 12 (3), which you have open in front of you, reads, well, the first part of it reads, The courts of a member state should also have jurisdiction in relation to proceedings other than those referred to in paragraph 1. Now its predecessor was -- I realised I've also not in the course of the argument gone through the history of the Brussels regulations, that is set out in full in my document, I assume I needn't do that.

And so I turn to the other two hurdles, which I have to get over and the first is that the jurisdiction the court has been expressed accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. And there are two components of that which we need to consider. And the first I want to consider is at the time the court is seized. And of course, here there is a distinction between -- the issue is, does that refer to a specific event in time, meaning when the court is first seized, or a continuum of time, such a period of time as the court is seized? The Court of Appeal held that it meant the latter. It's our submission that it means the former. Although crucially, of course, later events are relevant in determining the position at the outset of the proceedings. We rely on a number of points in support of our preferred interpretation. We submit that the word, has been, in Article 12 (3) (b), is more consistent with a specific point in time. We point to the fact that under Article eight, the same phrase is used. Articulate the basic general jurisdiction. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of principle, over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seized. It is our submission to the court that the contrary interpretation would drain any meaning or effectiveness from the articles, because the crucial purpose of a jurisdictional rule, in our submission, is to determine whether the court has jurisdiction at the start of the proceedings, so they continue to determine the issue.

It is plain that Article 12 (1) (b) of Brussels II Revised when it speaks to the jurisdiction being quote, except expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized is not simply referring to a mere submission in matrimonial proceedings equivalent to what would be an entry of appearance under Brussels I Article 24. First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction to enrage the matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner. This must mean that accepting the jurisdiction of a court, other than that of a child's habitual residence, is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be [inaudible] by the parties at the time the proceedings are instituted. And then Your Lordship proceeded to recite the [inaudible] 12 to the regulation in paragraph 54. The first point, My Lord, we need to consider here, because in that case, the case turned on whether acknowledging the service effectively or whether the filing of a statement of arrangements in divorce proceedings amounted to consent. The court held not. The point I want to concentrate on is the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner, this must mean that acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be attributed by the parent at the time the proceedings are instituted. Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case.

Taking it forward if one considers the effect of Article 17 of the revised regulation. Article 17, coupled together with Article 18 provides a positive onus on judges to consider jurisdiction at the earliest possible stage and realistically, there's a limit to the scope for that to be done when proceedings are launched. And that comes to the analysis of the interplay between the different aspects of Article 12(3)(b) and that is to say accepted express or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. At the time the court is seized, it may well be that there is only one active party. The other party won't necessarily have had the chance to say anything at all. And there is a difficulty at the moment with that. It's a difficulty which some practitioners address by writing on a document acknowledging service, that acknowledgement is made subject to a challenge to jurisdiction.

But in my submission to the court, is the meaning is absolutely clear. It is arguable whether it is from the competence of the EU to have done what it's done. But it has done it. In my submission, it is absolutely clear. I wanted to go back to try to just explore, without having the answers, I'm afraid, My Lord, the interconnection between 1996 Convention and that again involves looking at Dr Borrás' report in 1998 and having the Hague Convention and the regulation opened. The Hague Convention is at tab 4, isn't it, in volume 1 and, Article 10 on the third page, provides an equivalent to the article, the non revised original Brussels II provision. In other words, a prorogation in respect of a child habitually resident in another contracting State. So without prejudice to the previous articles which established the basic jurisdictional rules, the authorities of a contracting State under the Hague Convention exercising jurisdiction decide upon an application for divorce or legal separation of the parents of a child habitually resident in another contracting State or for annulment of their marriage may, if the law of the State so provides, take measures directed to the protection of the personal property of such child if at the time of commencement of the proceedings, one of his or her parents habitually resides in that State and one of them has parental responsibility in relation to the child and (b), the jurisdiction of these authorities to take such measures has been accepted by the parents as well as by any other person who has parental responsibility in relation to the child and is in the best interests of the child. And then the jurisdiction ceases, you will see the similar terms. If we compare that with Brussels, we already looked at Brussels, the original Brussels II at tab 6, you'll remember that is in very similar terms to the Article 3 (2).

21	p1,01:41:12.310,01:43:25.140,spk_0,	True	Counsel: No, it's not. But the point is that I succeed to make is that in those circumstances, under Article 3, there is an express reference to habitual residents. So where the child is not habitually resident in the member state, the court of that state shall have jurisdiction in such matters. If the child habitual resident in one of the member states and the test is satisfied, police are satisfied. Contrast Article 12, which of course, is headed prorogation, The courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction in divorce proceedings shall have jurisdiction in relation any matter where any parents really connected with that application, where and then the hurdles are inserted. So there is no reference, no restriction there to children who are habitually resident in one of the member states. [Pause]. And in our submission, there's no justification for reading into Article 12 (1). Or more importantly, for this case, Article 12 (3). The phrase in respect of a child who is habitually resident in a member state. I think this is a rhetorical point. If the authors had intended to limit the scope of the jurisdictional rules to cases where the trial was a fixture at the member state, given that they said so now in Brussels II we submit they surely would have done in Brussels II revised. The Court: Another way of putting that is that the commission must be presumed to be deliberate. Counsel: Yes, My Lord, and that first point --

But looking at the sub article the date of seising is with with respect clear from the four corners of the regulation by Article 16. Looking at the instant case one approach that My Lords could have is to say, well what on the basis of all the evidence was the position of the parties at the time of seising? There we go back leaving aside for the moment questions of variation and continuation of proceedings which are interesting to the undertaking given by the father at the time of the relocation, and he is undertaking was to return the child if called upon to do so by the court, not in these proceedings. And it could have said in these proceedings but it didn't. By the court that is the English court. The father therefore, it might be said, was inevitably and following intensive proceedings in which he had been represented, making a concession for all the world to see and one which bound him on paying a possible imprisonment to respond obediently to requests from the English court. Now My Lords the use or the continued use of undertakings in relocation cases has been the subject of much interest to practitioners and of the occasional observation by judges, including in the Court of Appeal. And it's sometimes being said that their outmoded, particularly in cases where, for example, the Hague Child Abduction Convention applies. This is not one of those cases. It might be said that in the generality of cases in which the Brussels II revised regulation applies while they are outmoded or they're a clumsy way of achieving an end if what the court really has in mind is a reservation of jurisdiction.

22	p2,01:02:18.080,01:03:23.320,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: And in this case we're looking at a child's welfare, several years on into the proceedings. This point was considered, actually, My Lord, by Mr Justice Hedley in another case, the case of C v C, which is at tab 25 in the authority. So in my copy, that's volume two of the authority, tab 25. It is reported somewhere that we've got the [inaudible] report, and this is about a case in which a mother had been given permission to remove a child to Spain. A lot of the cases involve Spain. And the father subsequently brought further proceedings in England for contact with the child. Paragraph 12, the father's counsel says this. He says at all times, up to a letter, last summer, the mother fully participated in the proceedings. At all material times she was representative, took no issue on jurisdiction, even though the children must have been habitually resident in Spain for many months. It is true that the wording is in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized. That cannot, he contends, be narrowly construed since at the time of being seized, the issue of an application, a respondent may well have no knowledge of the matter. He submits to the court, absent express acceptance and has agreed that there is none here. Must look at the litigation, conduct and draw inferences from it. He estimated there is only one inference here, and that is now too late to object to jurisdiction of this current matter. Paragraph 16, halfway down the page, halfway down the paragraph, line seven, given that Miss Harding cannot challenge the fact on the mother's participation in the proceeding, she's for the mother, including an application whilst acting in person for an extension of time, the question can be further refined, and I think this is My Lord's point, can the mother be said to have accepted jurisdiction in an unequivocal map if she had never appreciated that it was able to challenge. It is that question that I'm required to answer. It would be unreal to think that the question of jurisdiction has never occurred to anyone. And I interject that in this case we know that it had. That said, however, I do accept Miss Harding's submission that no one ever saw it as a problem, and thus the mother did not specifically address in her mind an objection to it. In my judgement, the fundamental approach to this should be, what inference should be drawn from the mother's litigation conduct? The answer to that is clear. Complete acceptance. Then one should ask whether a failure to address the question of challenge vitiates what otherwise appears to be an unequivocal acceptance. I do not think it does. This case demonstrates a clear acceptance of the court's jurisdiction at least until late 2006, by which time, at any [inaudible] the court must be seized with the matter. Accordingly, it is then too late to object. In my judgement, the evidence demonstrates unequivocal participation in the proceedings and thus an acceptance of the jurisdiction. I do not think that the absence, as I'm prepared to accept it was, of advice on her right to object should vitiate the unequivocal acceptance otherwise is damaged. I'm glad to reach that view in this case, as questions of jurisdiction should be resolved at the outset of the case are not on the eve of the final hearing. That point of policy also fortifies my view that the court should be looking at what the partners have actually done, rather than the reasons or lack of them for doing it absent, of course, for misrepresentation. So that's the view of an extremely experienced judgment at first instance, addresses the very point Your Lordship was making.
22	p1,01:37:11.450,01:38:39.850,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The first issue arising is whether that power is confined as his contended on behalf of the father, to children who are habitually resident within the EU or extends to all children. As we contend. If that construction is correct, jurisdiction could be [inaudible] to cover Q. Provided the criteria Article 12 for you are satisfied before I turn to the question of third State. Could I just invite the court to look at Article 12 (3) and its predecessor. Article 12 (3), which you have open in front of you, reads, well, the first part of it reads, The courts of a member state should also have jurisdiction in relation to proceedings other than those referred to in paragraph 1. Now its predecessor was -- I realised I've also not in the course of the argument gone through the history of the Brussels regulations, that is set out in full in my document, I assume I needn't do that.

And the comparison I wish to draw is, in fact, between the old article 3 under Brussels II and in fact, strictly, it's the matrimonial jurisdiction, article 12 (1). Because, of course, there was no equivalent to Article 12 (3) in the Brussels II regulations. So if I could invite the court to have Brussels II at tab six, Article 31 and Brussels II revised Article 12, run open and compare the two. So tab 1 10 6 Brussels II Article 31 says the courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction by virtue of article to an application for divorce and legal separation of marriage annulment shall have jurisdiction in respect, in respect of matters, respect a matter of principle, overcharging both prizes where the child is habitually resident in that member state to where the child is not a bit she resident in the member state referred to in paragraph one. Yeah, the court of that state shall have jurisdiction shut a matter if the child is in which the present in one of the member states and and then the two tests are set out.

The jurisdiction of the court has been past tense, accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner, and I'm now going to read it with an emphasis by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. So, in other words, that's a description, not at the time at which there must be the express acceptance, but the time at which the constituent parties who have to give their consent are counted.

22	p2,00:10:06.940,00:10:18.890,Appellant ,	True	Counnsel: Now, Dr Borrás' commentary about this is quite interesting, at tab 9 in the same bundle. This is Dr Borrás' report, in case it is not clear, is the explanatory report prepared for the Convention, we jumped ahead of this this morning, but before initially, the plan was that the new EU rules and procedures about jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of matrimonial cases, was to be the subject of a convention rather than a regulation. But in the event, the draft convention was converted into a regulation. I'm sure I use inelegant and inaccurate language, but that's what happened. This report is an explanatory report for the convention that became the regulation, Brussels II, Dr Borrás'. And can I ask you, please, turn to page 12 and 13, and beginning at paragraph 35 you see a heading, parental responsibility. Paragraph 35 simply recites paraphrases Article 3 of Brussels II. And then she says this, paragraph 36. The structure and content of this provision are the product of difficult negotiation, both within the community and in relation to worldwide provisions, particularly the 1996 Hague Convention. The fact that the community Convention limits itself to children habitually resident in the Member State facilitates its compatibility with the Hague Convention. The agreement between the Member States to include this matter within the scope of the Convention simply transferred the problem to the establishment of grounds for jurisdiction. Since while there were no problems where the child is habitually resident in the State as authorities have jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings, the same does not apply to cases where the child is habitually resident in another Member State. The problem is further complicated by the fact that Article 52 (2) of the Hague Convention provides that the Convention does not affect the possibility of one or more contracting States to conclude agreements which contain, in respect of children habitually resident in any of the States parties to such agreements, provisions on matters governed by that Convention. As a result, where both Conventions are in force -- remember, by both Conventions, she means Hague and the anticipated Brussels Convention. The Convention to which this report relates will take precedence in respect of children resident in Member States of the EU which are party to it. Whereas the Hague Convention will apply to other cases. There are no problems in relation to Article 3 (1), which establishes jurisdiction in the matter relating to parental responsibility over a child of both spouses where the child is habitually resident in the Member State, whose authorities also exercise jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings. It needs to be made clear that in no case does that provision mean that it must be the same authority in the State concerned to rule on the matrimonial and the parental responsibility. The rule is intended not only to establish that the authorities deciding on both matters are authorities of the same State. In practise, they will be the same authorities in some States and separate authorities in others. For the purpose of the Convention, the only point of interest is that they'd be authorities of the same Member State with due regard for internal distribution of competence. Paragraph 2 sets out the conditions under which the authorities of the Member State exercising jurisdiction on the divorce also have jurisdiction to decide parental responsibility, where the child is resident, not in that State but in another Member State. Both the following conditions have to be met. At least one of the spouses must have responsibility in relation to the child, and the jurisdiction of the courts must be accepted by the spouses and must be in the best interests of the child. This provision is taken from Article 10 (1) of the 1996 Hague Convention, which guarantees that there is no contradiction between Article 3 (2) of the Convention under discussion and the relevant provisions of the Hague Convention. The relevant provision of the Hague convention is practically the same thing, the only difference being that, in addition to requiring that one of the parents has responsibility, it also requires that at the time of the commencement proceedings, one of the parents habitually resides in that state. The difference derives from the differing subject matters of the two Conventions. The Hague Convention deals with the protection of children, whereas the Convention to which this report relates deals in matrimonial matters and for that reason the parents connection with the territory of a State for the purpose of determining jurisdiction in matrimonial matters is determined by the grounds set out in Article 2. Article 3 (2) is designed to cover one particular situation in which the best solution is to use the same grounds of the Hague Convention. So the important point is that, according to Dr Borrás, the terms of the original Brussels II regulation in this regard, were effectively designed to facilitate compatibility with the Hague Convention.

23	p2,00:51:20.810,00:53:49.170,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Lord Collins' -- Lord Justice Lawrence's, at paragraph 53 on page 11. It is plain that Article 12 (1) (b) of Brussels II Revised when it speaks to the jurisdiction being quote, except expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized is not simply referring to a mere submission in matrimonial proceedings equivalent to what would be an entry of appearance under Brussels I Article 24. First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction to enrage the matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner. This must mean that accepting the jurisdiction of a court, other than that of a child's habitual residence, is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be [inaudible] by the parties at the time the proceedings are instituted. And then Your Lordship proceeded to recite the [inaudible] 12 to the regulation in paragraph 54. The first point, My Lord, we need to consider here, because in that case, the case turned on whether acknowledging the service effectively or whether the filing of a statement of arrangements in divorce proceedings amounted to consent. The court held not. The point I want to concentrate on is the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner, this must mean that acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be attributed by the parent at the time the proceedings are instituted. Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case.

23	p1,00:42:18.400,00:44:18.510,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And as recognised by the court itself, it is not possible to enforce any order for contact against those living in Pakistan. And then at Paragraph 28, he repeats -- well, Paragraph 22 he -- has a section headed, jurisdiction, on page five, recites in Paragraph 25, what he says the law is. Section 8, the jurisdictions based either on the Family Law Act 1986. I think there must be an, or, intended or the council regulation Brussels II revised. Paragraph 26, Given the child is in Pakistan, the council regulation is not applicable and the court needs to look at the physical present which residents have found jurisdiction. Q is not physically present in the jurisdiction and no party seems to suggest he's habitually resident. Habitually resident is not subject to time, its meaning is essentially based on the facts and looking at all the circumstances of the case. Its meaning is similar to ordinary resident requires appreciable period of time to live in a particular place. Pakistan is clearly his place of habitual residence. There is, however, case law which provides a basis for jurisdiction, namely, where there is an application to vary a Section 8 order value made in the UK, notwithstanding the child was neither habitually resident nor present in the UK, see Re S, in which the court had jurisdiction even though the child had moved to live in Holland since an order was made. The father accepts the court has retained jurisdiction to make orders directed towards himself in relation to contact. Difficulty, as any orders in relation to contact cannot be enforced. As Mr Justice Headley recognised, he could not compel anyone who lives in Pakistan to do anything.

23	p2,00:22:13.840,00:24:14.450,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: I don't think I can add to that debate, My Lady, because I've obviously been focusing on the more contentious aspects as far as [inaudible] is concerned. And so I turn to the other two hurdles, which I have to get over and the first is that the jurisdiction the court has been expressed accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. And there are two components of that which we need to consider. And the first I want to consider is at the time the court is seized. And of course, here there is a distinction between -- the issue is, does that refer to a specific event in time, meaning when the court is first seized, or a continuum of time, such a period of time as the court is seized? The Court of Appeal held that it meant the latter. It's our submission that it means the former. Although crucially, of course, later events are relevant in determining the position at the outset of the proceedings. We rely on a number of points in support of our preferred interpretation. We submit that the word, has been, in Article 12 (3) (b), is more consistent with a specific point in time. We point to the fact that under Article eight, the same phrase is used. Articulate the basic general jurisdiction. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of principle, over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seized. It is our submission to the court that the contrary interpretation would drain any meaning or effectiveness from the articles, because the crucial purpose of a jurisdictional rule, in our submission, is to determine whether the court has jurisdiction at the start of the proceedings, so they continue to determine the issue.

23	p4,00:21:18.560,00:23:56.680,spk_1,	True	Counsel: If I may, well I let me My Lord come to that now. There are a number of possible ways that it could be read. But looking at the sub article the date of seizing is with with respect clear from the four corners of the regulation by Article 16. Looking at the instant case one approach that My Lords could have is to say, well what on the basis of all the evidence was the position of the parties at the time of seising? There we go back leaving aside for the moment questions of variation and continuation of proceedings which are interesting to the undertaking given by the father at the time of the relocation, and he is undertaking was to return the child if called upon to do so by the court, not in these proceedings. And it could have said in these proceedings but it didn't. By the court that is the English court. The father therefore, it might be said, was inevitably and following intensive proceedings in which he had been represented, making a concession for all the world to see and one which bound him on paying a possible imprisonment to respond obediently to requests from the English court. Now My Lords the use or the continued use of undertakings in relocation cases has been the subject of much interest to practitioners and of the occasional observation by judges, including in the Court of Appeal. And it's sometimes being said that their outmoded, particularly in cases where, for example, the Hague Child Abduction Convention applies. This is not one of those cases. It might be said that in the generality of cases in which the Brussels II revised regulation applies while they are outmoded or they're a clumsy way of achieving an end if what the court really has in mind is a reservation of jurisdiction.
23	p1,00:27:34.820,00:33:51.980,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And then the order, to just go on to the order. The order requires the father to bring the child to the jurisdiction. For contact, the following year, this June, June for 8 weeks, June, July 2009 and provides the mother to have reasonable contact with the child either as agreed or as ordered by the court with reasonable telephone contact with a child in Pakistan and the mother is at liberty to visiting and contact the child in Pakistan. The father, having assured the court that she will be safe with his family and the judgement hopefully, in my hope, is immediately behind that, my tab eight in appendix part one. I don't know what tab number it is in court bundle. The next document is that Mr Justice Headley's judgment. Now, much of this judgment is deals with issues that arose because the judge was here in person and again, I don't propose to go through it in full unless the court wishes me to do so. But he recites the history, some of the evidence he'd heard he got the -- he asked the senior CAFCASS officer in the High Court Mr Miller, to attend to help see the parties and discuss matters. He recites what Mr Miller said to him. Paragraph 17 in the judgment and then paragraph 19 he says, I have no doubt that the court ought to give further consideration as to how this case is to be managed in the long term. It being incredibly obvious to me and not the party that trying to deal with the kind of time scale attempted this time around in such a court case merely underlines the difficulties that the court is inevitably confronted with. It is also my intention to crystallise out a statement of aspiration in paragraph five of the order the 12th December 2007 by directing the attendance of K, child in this jurisdiction in 2000 and nine on the basis that is apparently un contentious between the parties. And he may not be just a holiday but returned in case, in which case the court in every needs to be involved because they would be close to the future of contact can be considered. The mothers receive an assurance from the London borough of Newham they would undertake an assessment of their capacity to have unsupervised contact, which must be her first aspiration. If that is granted, where it will lead is, of course, a matter that stretches sufficiently far in the future to be very unwise for this court to make any comment about now. And that is an assessment to which, of course you must be entitled and is in a sense, which is of course futile without the presence of the child, or at least it could be started. But it cannot be completed without the presence of the stuff -- of the child. So those are matters about which I have no doubt which I will do course reduced in due course, reduce into order form that there needs the issue about this summer I contact in summer 2008, upon which, as upon many issues, the parties remained hopelessly divided. The judge recites parties arguments Paragraph 24, 25, 26. Now I do not, for one moment underestimate the importance of this matter to the perils. On the face of it, the mother makes a perfectly reasonable application. On the face of it, the father raises not unreasonable objections to visit taking place this summer. One simply has to recognise that this is so, one also has to acknowledge that is generally desirable strongly in the interests of a child to maintain a proper relationship with both his parents, both of whom, of course, at this stage live in the United Kingdom, which he does not. And so one recognises that in the ordinary circumstances, it is perfectly reasonable that matters should take place as contemplated. There's nothing ordinary about this case at all. The relationships are vindictive, the willingness to discuss is wholly absent nobody's able to speak without making any allegations against each other, and the whole thing is hopelessly fraught. That of course immediately to ask myself, What on earth is that I'm bringing this child into if I were to require to return? And I fear that what happened last time he was here and there was an issue about what happened to him, which I won't go into whichever account one chooses to look at, whether the mother or father does nothing but add to the concerns, then he makes further comments about the parents. And then he goes on Paragraph 29. I have, of course, no power, whatever to compel anyone in Pakistan to do anything. The only power I have is to compel the mother or the father by reason of their being parents and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the court. No one else is because, of course, the child is entirely lawfully in Pakistan. And indeed it is unusual that the court should be retaining jurisdiction in this case because, of course, the child is habitually resident in Pakistan and were this a European case the court would be positively deprived of jurisdiction by the structure of European parenting law, but it is not, and the court undoubtedly does have jurisdiction because both parties have not only submitted to the jurisdiction but have actually invoked it on a number of occasions. And so the question of jurisdiction of itself does not present a problem in this case, though, of course, the question of enforcement of orders might. I've considered the implications of that paragraph on a number of occasions of recent months, and were I to remove the two references to European, then there will be no difficulty. We'll come back onto the -- come back to the interpretation, if I may, a little later. But the point I want to emphasise is that the learned judge relied in his recent conclusion, the court undoubtedly does have jurisdiction on the fact the parties have not only submitted to the jurisdiction, but had actually invoked it on a number of occasions.
23	p2,01:02:18.080,01:03:23.320,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: And in this case we're looking at a child's welfare, several years on into the proceedings. This point was considered, actually, My Lord, by Mr Justice Hedley in another case, the case of C v C, which is at tab 25 in the authority. So in my copy, that's volume two of the authority, tab 25. It is reported somewhere that we've got the [inaudible] report, and this is about a case in which a mother had been given permission to remove a child to Spain. A lot of the cases involve Spain. And the father subsequently brought further proceedings in England for contact with the child. Paragraph 12, the father's counsel says this. He says at all times, up to a letter, last summer, the mother fully participated in the proceedings. At all material times she was representative, took no issue on jurisdiction, even though the children must have been habitually resident in Spain for many months. It is true that the wording is in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized. That cannot, he contends, be narrowly construed since at the time of being seized, the issue of an application, a respondent may well have no knowledge of the matter. He submits to the court, absent express acceptance and has agreed that there is none here. Must look at the litigation, conduct and draw inferences from it. He estimated there is only one inference here, and that is now too late to object to jurisdiction of this current matter. Paragraph 16, halfway down the page, halfway down the paragraph, line seven, given that Miss Harding cannot challenge the fact on the mother's participation in the proceeding, she's for the mother, including an application whilst acting in person for an extension of time, the question can be further refined, and I think this is My Lord's point, can the mother be said to have accepted jurisdiction in an unequivocal map if she had never appreciated that it was able to challenge. It is that question that I'm required to answer. It would be unreal to think that the question of jurisdiction has never occurred to anyone. And I interject that in this case we know that it had. That said, however, I do accept Miss Harding's submission that no one ever saw it as a problem, and thus the mother did not specifically address in her mind an objection to it. In my judgement, the fundamental approach to this should be, what inference should be drawn from the mother's litigation conduct? The answer to that is clear. Complete acceptance. Then one should ask whether a failure to address the question of challenge vitiates what otherwise appears to be an unequivocal acceptance. I do not think it does. This case demonstrates a clear acceptance of the court's jurisdiction at least until late 2006, by which time, at any [inaudible] the court must be seized with the matter. Accordingly, it is then too late to object. In my judgement, the evidence demonstrates unequivocal participation in the proceedings and thus an acceptance of the jurisdiction. I do not think that the absence, as I'm prepared to accept it was, of advice on her right to object should vitiate the unequivocal acceptance otherwise is damaged. I'm glad to reach that view in this case, as questions of jurisdiction should be resolved at the outset of the case are not on the eve of the final hearing. That point of policy also fortifies my view that the court should be looking at what the partners have actually done, rather than the reasons or lack of them for doing it absent, of course, for misrepresentation. So that's the view of an extremely experienced judgment at first instance, addresses the very point Your Lordship was making.
23	p3,01:27:14.340,01:28:22.180,spk_0,	True	Counsel: That's the difficulty with having the seisure at the first moment that the court has the case in front of it with the documents and both parties. Unless there is an absolute unequivocal, Yes, we both want this. It's not just enough to say, Well you know I'm here. There it has to be unequivocal is says that. Unambiguous. It means that. And so in the face of this case, it wasn't there at the first opportunity because the only other way of imputing it would be to say later on after he had been to court several times and his counsel filed a document expressly accepting jurisdiction, that's when it's accepted. But that doesn't fit in with the provisions of the regulations, My Lords and My Lady.

And then the position statements which we looked at earlier, which he says, the court has retained jurisdiction and the father accepts the court's jurisdiction. Although adding a rider about the enforceability of any orders made. Now in our submission, contrary to the -- with respect to Lord Justice Thorpe's analysis -- Lord Justice Thorpe said when the judge individually or cumulatively, I'm quite unpersuaded anything the father has done within this jurisdiction amounts to an unequivocal acceptance. It's our submission, we don't invite the courts to look at the Acts individually, but to look at them cumulatively in the context of the undertaking given in 2004. And we submit that it is manifestly unequivocal acceptance. It's only very, very late in the day that he seeks to challenge jurisdiction. Prior to doing so, he's given an undertaking to the Court to return the child to the Court, if ordered to do so by the Court. He submitted to at least two defined contact orders. His father position statement saying, I accept the court has jurisdiction, and he's made an application to the court himself.

The reason for that is the purposive argument that the purpose of Article 12 is to enable the court to determine whether it has jurisdiction and in my submission, it would be manifestly unworkable if the court were required, the instance of any party to review the question whether it still has jurisdiction at all stages of the proceedings. Either the court has jurisdiction or it does not.

Taking it forward if one considers the effect of Article 17 of the revised regulation. Article 17, coupled together with Article 18 provides a positive onus on judges to consider jurisdiction at the earliest possible stage and realistically, there's a limit to the scope for that to be done when proceedings are launched. And that comes to the analysis of the interplay between the different aspects of Article 12(3)(b) and that is to say accepted express or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. At the time the court is seized, it may well be that there is only one active party. The other party won't necessarily have had the chance to say anything at all. And there is a difficulty at the moment with that. It's a difficulty which some practitioners address by writing on a document acknowledging service, that acknowledgement is made subject to a challenge to jurisdiction.

If you do, do you go through the hoops if this is a children's case only of Article 12.3 that could be recorded on the face of the order, and then there would be no room for doubt, including in the foreign court. That wasn't done in this case, and I have to say from experience it tends not to be done, save by rare first instance judges, in any case.

Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case.

The jurisdiction of the court has been past tense, accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner, and I'm now going to read it with an emphasis by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. So, in other words, that's a description, not at the time at which there must be the express acceptance, but the time at which the constituent parties who have to give their consent are counted.

25	p4,00:33:52.440,00:37:24.460,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Many years ago, this house and I'm afraid I've not put the authority before the house, considered the concept of retention in child abduction cases. It was H and S and the parties argued on the one hand, I said this house that house it was, on the one hand, the contention that retention was a continuing stage under the Hague Convention, one could pick the date that was most convenient for the parties to illustrate a point. Or in this case, a date following a contracting state entering the relevant convention. The House said no fixed terminus a quo, and one has to look at the earlier state of retention despite the word retention which carries with it a certain continuum. In this case, we suggest seizing is clear. It's got to be that early moment that the regulation doesn't give scope for any other interpretation. But an evaluation of jurisdiction will be based on material which of course will gradually grow with the progression of the proceedings. And this will be the case in every set of proceedings. It will grow first when a second party has joined in practical terms. Thus the document starting the proceedings is issued and served, and then in some proceedings, most proceedings, the party served will have the opportunity to respond. Then there will be a court appearance and then there may be submissions and there may be evidence. We suggest that there are a number of ways of looking at Article 12.3. One is to say yes, it's got to be determined at the moment of seizing with such material as may be available at the moment of seizing. So perhaps a judge who may be a judge at a very low level in a registry who receives a paper application will have to look at it and say, Well does Article 12.3 apply because there is a consent? In that case, there'd have to be a fairly radical overhaul of the way proceedings are started if people are to have the chance of accepting or not accepting. A second possibility is that which I've postulated as the rabbit pulled out of the hat. A third is to say the date is the date of seizing. One can look at material, which comes to light subsequent to that, but rather as one would in public law care proceedings. One has to look back to that particular date to see what the position was then. There's an argument that in this case, such a test would be satisfied because of the undertakings given in the relocation in proceedings.
25	p3,01:38:30.700,01:38:55.250,spk_2,	True	The Court: One possibility is one actually has an express written agreement between the parties at some earlier stage. Let's assume it was there in September 2004, one had actually a document which they both signed saying, We accept the jurisdiction of the English courts in regard to our parental responsibility and in regard to this child. Not tied to any particular proceedings it's just simply accepting the jurisdiction of the court. 
25	p2,01:09:31.270,01:10:11.980,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Then moving to the point I want to make about 12(3) initially is to acknowledge the syntax point, namely, that the phrase reads, the jurisdiction of the court has been accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to proceedings at the time the court is seized and is in the best interests of the child. So the phrase, and is in the best interests of the child, in the sentence, in the clause, comes after the phrase, at the time the court is seised.

25	p3,01:00:53.320,01:01:41.500,spk_5,	True	The Court: That's a different point as to -- I'm just trying to find out what is meant by the word at the time the court is seised in paragraph Article 12 Paragraph 3(b). There are two possibilities as I see it. One is that it identifies a moment. Counsel: I see. The Court: There's scope for argument as to when that moment is. A second theoretical possibility is, at least, that it encompasses the whole of the time over which the court is seised in which case an unequivocal agreement at any time during that whole period would presumably be sufficient. But the case on the other side, I think, is that at the time the court is seised identifies a moment. So, in order to -- first question therefore is you accept that we are looking for a -- whether you accept -- Counsel: No I don't accept that we are looking for a moment.

25	p3,01:02:02.600,01:03:23.640,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I'm saying that the court has to look -- once the court is seised of the matter at the beginning, which is in the sense when the proceedings were started in favour of the matter is filed, the court is seised of it then, but the court continues to be seised with it. And there are two reasons why I'm saying that one has to look at the continuance of the seising of the court. The first is that one cannot glean unequivocal acceptance unless it's expressly made and that's something that I'm going to have to deal with separately. And also, because it says all the parties and it is very common, certainly in children cases, for children to become involved if there have been, for example, public law cases in the background such as there are here. And it is those kind of cases where there would be children living in non-European Union countries as well. Those are the kind of cases that we're looking at within the context of this case.
25	p2,00:19:48.640,00:21:06.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Article 12 (3) of Brussels II Revised specifies three criteria for the prorogation of jurisdiction by courts of a Member State in matters of responsibility over a child, all of which have to be satisfied, namely, one, that the child has a substantial connection with that Member State. Article 12 (3) (a). Two that the jurisdiction of the court has been accepted expressly or otherwise, in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. Article 12 (3) (b). And three, the jurisdictions in the best interests of the child. Article 12 (3) (b) again. Now as far as the first criterion is concerned, Article 12 (3) (a), that is manifestly satisfied, and this is not contentious because under Article 12 (3) (a) itself specifically provides that a substantial connection will be established, in particular, by virtue of the fact that one of the holders of parental responsibility is habitually resident in that Member State or the child is a national of that Member State. In this case, both of those exemplar conditions are satisfied and consequently, as agreed by all parties, the child has a substantial connection with this country.

25	p2,00:26:35.130,00:27:05.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: My submission to the court will be that it is, and may I come back to that My Lord? Because that is obviously a linked but different point. And again, towards the end of my submissions on this point, draw your attention back to the practise guide at page 12, tab 2 page 12, reminding ourselves, of course, this is only a persuasive authority, actually, it's 13. Top of the page, page 13. The question of jurisdiction is determined at the time the court is seized. Once a competent court is seized, in principle, it retains jurisdiction even if the child acquires habitual residence in another Member State during the course of the court proceeding. That, of course, is dealing with the Article 8 point and in my submission illustrates clearly the point that I've been making. Tab 2 page 13 top of the page. Now one of the factors which influenced the Court of Appeal's contrary interpretation was that it would preclude any party subsequently joined to the proceedings from having any right to refuse to accept jurisdiction. Obviously, parties can be added to the proceedings, all proceedings, not only family proceedings, and not infrequently are. And in this case, of course, the child as we've established was joined as a party to these proceedings. And Lord Justice Thorpe pointed out that if consent was confined to those parties who were parties at the outset of the proceedings, that would deprive a later joint party, in particular a child through the guardian, of the right to object to the court's jurisdiction. Well, My Lord, our response to that is, that's right, it does have that consequence, and the fact that it has that consequence does not, in our submission, in any way undermine the clear interpretation and meaning of the phrase. Parties added later cannot object, in our submission, to the jurisdiction. Although of course they can in this instance under the Children Act, invite the court not to make any order in the proceedings to which they have been joined. So we submit that Lord Justice Thorpe is right. It does have that consequence, but it is the clear consequence of the interpretation, which we say is absolutely absolutely clear on the words of the document.

And so I turn to the other two hurdles, which I have to get over and the first is that the jurisdiction the court has been expressed accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. And there are two components of that which we need to consider. And the first I want to consider is at the time the court is seized. And of course, here there is a distinction between -- the issue is, does that refer to a specific event in time, meaning when the court is first seized, or a continuum of time, such a period of time as the court is seized? The Court of Appeal held that it meant the latter. It's our submission that it means the former. Although crucially, of course, later events are relevant in determining the position at the outset of the proceedings. We rely on a number of points in support of our preferred interpretation. We submit that the word, has been, in Article 12 (3) (b), is more consistent with a specific point in time. We point to the fact that under Article eight, the same phrase is used. Articulate the basic general jurisdiction. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of principle, over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seized. It is our submission to the court that the contrary interpretation would drain any meaning or effectiveness from the articles, because the crucial purpose of a jurisdictional rule, in our submission, is to determine whether the court has jurisdiction at the start of the proceedings, so they continue to determine the issue.
26	p4,00:30:23.720,00:31:15.860,spk_1,	True	Counsel: I hope I haven't fallen flat. If one looks carefully at Article 12(3)(b) and one reads it in this way. The jurisdiction of the court has been, past tense, accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner, and I'm now going to read it with an emphasis, By all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. So, in other words, that's a description, not at the time at which there must be the express acceptance, but the time at which the constituent parties who have to give their consent are counted.

26	p2,01:02:18.080,01:03:23.320,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: And in this case we're looking at a child's welfare, several years on into the proceedings. This point was considered, actually, My Lord, by Mr Justice Hedley in another case, the case of C v C, which is at tab 25 in the authority. So in my copy, that's volume two of the authority, tab 25. It is reported somewhere that we've got the [inaudible] report, and this is about a case in which a mother had been given permission to remove a child to Spain. A lot of the cases involve Spain. And the father subsequently brought further proceedings in England for contact with the child. Paragraph 12, the father's counsel says this. He says at all times, up to a letter, last summer, the mother fully participated in the proceedings. At all material times she was representative, took no issue on jurisdiction, even though the children must have been habitually resident in Spain for many months. It is true that the wording is in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized. That cannot, he contends, be narrowly construed since at the time of being seized, the issue of an application, a respondent may well have no knowledge of the matter. He submits to the court, absent express acceptance and has agreed that there is none here. Must look at the litigation, conduct and draw inferences from it. He estimated there is only one inference here, and that is now too late to object to jurisdiction of this current matter. Paragraph 16, halfway down the page, halfway down the paragraph, line seven, given that Miss Harding cannot challenge the fact on the mother's participation in the proceeding, she's for the mother, including an application whilst acting in person for an extension of time, the question can be further refined, and I think this is My Lord's point, can the mother be said to have accepted jurisdiction in an unequivocal map if she had never appreciated that it was able to challenge. It is that question that I'm required to answer. It would be unreal to think that the question of jurisdiction has never occurred to anyone. And I interject that in this case we know that it had. That said, however, I do accept Miss Harding's submission that no one ever saw it as a problem, and thus the mother did not specifically address in her mind an objection to it. In my judgement, the fundamental approach to this should be, what inference should be drawn from the mother's litigation conduct? The answer to that is clear. Complete acceptance. Then one should ask whether a failure to address the question of challenge vitiates what otherwise appears to be an unequivocal acceptance. I do not think it does. This case demonstrates a clear acceptance of the court's jurisdiction at least until late 2006, by which time, at any [inaudible] the court must be seized with the matter. Accordingly, it is then too late to object. In my judgement, the evidence demonstrates unequivocal participation in the proceedings and thus an acceptance of the jurisdiction. I do not think that the absence, as I'm prepared to accept it was, of advice on her right to object should vitiate the unequivocal acceptance otherwise is damaged. I'm glad to reach that view in this case, as questions of jurisdiction should be resolved at the outset of the case are not on the eve of the final hearing. That point of policy also fortifies my view that the court should be looking at what the partners have actually done, rather than the reasons or lack of them for doing it absent, of course, for misrepresentation. So that's the view of an extremely experienced judgment at first instance, addresses the very point Your Lordship was making.

I know you don't accept that. But assuming that we are correct, contrary to your argument, then we need to identify what that moment is. The moment is that identified as I see it, speaking entirely for myself, by Article 16. So, we have to look at the moment when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court. And that was in 31st of October 2007 or maybe a day or two later. So, on that hypothesis, we will be focusing would be only on the question whether there had been an acceptance.

The reason for that is the purposive argument that the purpose of Article 12 is to enable the court to determine whether it has jurisdiction and in my submission, it would be manifestly unworkable if the court were required, the instance of any party to review the question whether it still has jurisdiction at all stages of the proceedings.

It is plain that Article 12 (1) (b) of Brussels II Revised when it speaks to the jurisdiction being quote, except expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized is not simply referring to a mere submission in matrimonial proceedings equivalent to what would be an entry of appearance under Brussels I Article 24. First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction to enrage the matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner. This must mean that accepting the jurisdiction of a court, other than that of a child's habitual residence, is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be [inaudible] by the parties at the time the proceedings are instituted. And then Your Lordship proceeded to recite the [inaudible] 12 to the regulation in paragraph 54. The first point, My Lord, we need to consider here, because in that case, the case turned on whether acknowledging the service effectively or whether the filing of a statement of arrangements in divorce proceedings amounted to consent. The court held not. The point I want to concentrate on is the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner, this must mean that acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be attributed by the parent at the time the proceedings are instituted. Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case.

Well, if the court has to ask itself, Have I got jurisdiction. If the court did do that in this case until very late in the day. But if it asks at the outset, do I have jurisdiction? Then one of the questions the judge has to consider is do the parties agree or have they unequivocally accepted? If they haven't unequivocally accepted, that them to the election. Do you agree? If they say no, then he doesn't have jurisdiction under Article 12(3). If they say yes, then he does, and that's the end of it.

Then we consider the two hurdles under the prorogation provisions, which are relevant in this case, the proper interpretation of the phrase quote, The jurisdiction of the court has been accepted, expressed or otherwise, in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized, which involves two elements at the time is court is seized and unequivocal acceptance and then the phrase that interpretation, the phrase in the best interests of the child and then the fifth point.

Rather than having one country unilaterally declare imperiously seize jurisdiction, respect of a child who is not habitually resident, to deal with it consensually. That is obviously the way forward, one might think, and Article 15 anticipates that. But it doesn't arise in respect of countries that are not parties to the 1996 convention. That, My Lord, completes all I had wanted to say about third state. [Inaudible] I just put forward any further on that topic before I move to my next topic, which is the criteria for prorogation under under 12(3)?

27	p4,00:33:52.440,00:37:24.460,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Many years ago, this house and I'm afraid I've not put the authority before the house, considered the concept of retention in child abduction cases. It was H and S and the parties argued on the one hand, I said this house that house it was, on the one hand, the contention that retention was a continuing stage under the Hague Convention, one could pick the date that was most convenient for the parties to illustrate a point. Or in this case, a date following a contracting state entering the relevant convention. The House said no fixed terminus a quo, and one has to look at the earlier state of retention despite the word retention which carries with it a certain continuum. In this case, we suggest seizing is clear. It's got to be that early moment that the regulation doesn't give scope for any other interpretation. But an evaluation of jurisdiction will be based on material which of course will gradually grow with the progression of the proceedings. And this will be the case in every set of proceedings. It will grow first when a second party has joined in practical terms. Thus the document starting the proceedings is issued and served, and then in some proceedings, most proceedings, the party served will have the opportunity to respond. Then there will be a court appearance and then there may be submissions and there may be evidence. We suggest that there are a number of ways of looking at Article 12(3). One is to say yes, it's got to be determined at the moment of seising with such material as may be available at the moment of seising. So perhaps a judge who may be a judge at a very low level in a registry who receives a paper application will have to look at it and say, Well does Article 12(3) apply because there is a consent? In that case, there'd have to be a fairly radical overhaul of the way proceedings are started if people are to have the chance of accepting or not accepting. A second possibility is that which I've postulated as the rabbit pulled out of the hat. A third is to say the date is the date of seising. One can look at material, which comes to light subsequent to that, but rather as one would in public law care proceedings. One has to look back to that particular date to see what the position was then. There's an argument that in this case, such a test would be satisfied because of the undertakings given in the relocation in proceedings.

The Court of Appeal held that it meant the latter. It's our submission that it means the former. Although crucially, of course, later events are relevant in determining the position at the outset of the proceedings. We rely on a number of points in support of our preferred interpretation. We submit that the word, has been, in Article 12 (3) (b), is more consistent with a specific point in time. We point to the fact that under Article eight, the same phrase is used. Articulate the basic general jurisdiction. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of principle, over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seised. It is our submission to the court that the contrary interpretation would drain any meaning or effectiveness from the articles, because the crucial purpose of a jurisdictional rule, in our submission, is to determine whether the court has jurisdiction at the start of the proceedings, so they continue to determine the issue.

The reason for that is the purposive argument that the purpose of Article 12 is to enable the court to determine whether it has jurisdiction and in my submission, it would be manifestly unworkable if the court were required, the instance of any party to review the question whether it still has jurisdiction at all stages of the proceedings. Either the court has jurisdiction or it does not.

28	p3,02:24:00.670,02:25:08.320,spk_5,	True	The Court: Could I just ask you one question on the hypothesis, this relates to Article 12 (3)(b) on the hypothesis that at the time the court is seised, on the face of it means first seised. I know that there are arguments the other way but suppose that's the case. In a case, the difference between little b in Paragraph 3 and little b in Paragraph 1 is there, the agreement is simply that of the spouses, whereas in little b it's all the parties. And one view might be that the draughtsman contemplated it, that one of the parties would be at least the voice of the child and maybe the child. Now, is there any way in which one could construe little b as only coming into force, if you like, or only giving rise to the relevant seising once the child is made a party?
28	p4,00:21:18.560,00:23:56.680,spk_1,	True	Counsel: If I may, well I, let me, My Lords come to that now. There are a number of possible ways that it could be read. But looking at the sub article the date of seising is with with respect clear from the four corners of the regulation by Article 16. Looking at the instant case one approach that My Lords could have is to say, well what on the basis of all the evidence was the position of the parties at the time of seising? There we go back leaving aside for the moment questions of variation and continuation of proceedings which are interesting to the undertaking given by the father at the time of the relocation, and he is undertaking was to return the child if called upon to do so by the court, not in these proceedings. And it could have said in these proceedings but it didn't. By the court that is the English court. The father therefore, it might be said, was inevitably and following intensive proceedings in which he had been represented, making a concession for all the world to see and one which bound him on paying a possible imprisonment to respond obediently to requests from the English court. Now My Lords the use or the continued use of undertakings in relocation cases has been the subject of much interest to practitioners and of the occasional observation by judges, including in the Court of Appeal. And it's sometimes being said that their outmoded, particularly in cases where, for example, the Hague Child Abduction Convention applies. This is not one of those cases. It might be said that in the generality of cases in which the Brussels II revised regulation applies while they are outmoded or they're a clumsy way of achieving an end if what the court really has in mind is a reservation of jurisdiction.
28	p2,00:22:13.840,00:24:14.450,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: I don't think I can add to that debate, My Lady, because I've obviously been focusing on the more contentious aspects as far as [inaudible] is concerned. And so I turn to the other two hurdles, which I have to get over and the first is that the jurisdiction the court has been expressed accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seised. And there are two components of that which we need to consider. And the first I want to consider is at the time the court is seised. And of course, here there is a distinction between -- the issue is, does that refer to a specific event in time, meaning when the court is first seised, or a continuum of time, such a period of time as the court is seised?

28	p2,00:51:20.810,00:53:49.170,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Lord Collins' -- Lord Justice Lawrence's, at paragraph 53 on page 11. It is plain that Article 12 (1) (b) of Brussels II Revised when it speaks to the jurisdiction being quote, except expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized is not simply referring to a mere submission in matrimonial proceedings equivalent to what would be an entry of appearance under Brussels I Article 24. First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction to enrage the matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner. This must mean that accepting the jurisdiction of a court, other than that of a child's habitual residence, is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be [inaudible] by the parties at the time the proceedings are instituted. And then Your Lordship proceeded to recite the [inaudible] 12 to the regulation in paragraph 54. The first point, My Lord, we need to consider here, because in that case, the case turned on whether acknowledging the service effectively or whether the filing of a statement of arrangements in divorce proceedings amounted to consent. The court held not. The point I want to concentrate on is the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner, this must mean that acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be attributed by the parent at the time the proceedings are instituted. Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case.

28	p3,01:00:53.320,01:01:41.500,spk_5,	True	The Court: That's a different point as to -- I'm just trying to find out what is meant by the word at the time the court is seised in paragraph Article 12 Paragraph 3(b). There are two possibilities as I see it. One is that it identifies a moment. Counsel: I see. The Court: There's scope for argument as to when that moment is. A second theoretical possibility is, at least, that it encompasses the whole of the time over which the court is seised in which case an unequivocal agreement at any time during that whole period would presumably be sufficient. But the case on the other side, I think, is that at the time the court is seised identifies a moment. So, in order to -- first question therefore is you accept that we are looking for a -- whether you accept -- Counsel: No I don't accept that we are looking for a moment.
28	p4,00:33:52.440,00:37:24.460,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Many years ago, this house and I'm afraid I've not put the authority before the house, considered the concept of retention in child abduction cases. It was H and S and the parties argued on the one hand, I said this house that house it was, on the one hand, the contention that retention was a continuing stage under the Hague Convention, one could pick the date that was most convenient for the parties to illustrate a point. Or in this case, a date following a contracting state entering the relevant convention. The House said no fixed terminus a quo, and one has to look at the earlier state of retention despite the word retention which carries with it a certain continuum. In this case, we suggest seizing is clear. It's got to be that early moment that the regulation doesn't give scope for any other interpretation. But an evaluation of jurisdiction will be based on material which of course will gradually grow with the progression of the proceedings. And this will be the case in every set of proceedings. It will grow first when a second party has joined in practical terms. Thus the document starting the proceedings is issued and served, and then in some proceedings, most proceedings, the party served will have the opportunity to respond. Then there will be a court appearance and then there may be submissions and there may be evidence. We suggest that there are a number of ways of looking at Article 12(3). One is to say yes, it's got to be determined at the moment of seising with such material as may be available at the moment of seising. So perhaps a judge who may be a judge at a very low level in a registry who receives a paper application will have to look at it and say, Well does Article 12(3) apply because there is a consent? In that case, there'd have to be a fairly radical overhaul of the way proceedings are started if people are to have the chance of accepting or not accepting. A second possibility is that which I've postulated as the rabbit pulled out of the hat. A third is to say the date is the date of seising. One can look at material, which comes to light subsequent to that, but rather as one would in public law care proceedings. One has to look back to that particular date to see what the position was then. There's an argument that in this case, such a test would be satisfied because of the undertakings given in the relocation in proceedings.
28	p3,01:13:04.840,01:13:49.670,spk_5,	True	The Court: I'm on the moment of seising. On the hypothesis that on the true construction of the Article, we're looking for a single moment. I know you don't accept that. But assuming that we are correct, contrary to your argument, then we need to identify what that moment is. The moment is that identified as I see it, speaking entirely for myself, by Article 16. So, we have to look at the moment when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court. And that was in 31st of October 2007 or maybe a day or two later. So, on that hypothesis, we will be focusing would be only on the question whether there had been an acceptance.

Suppose for a moment we accept the view that the court is seised at the moment of the moment identified in Article 16 which is at the time when the document instituting the proceedings is launched with the court. Now in that analysis, assuming that there is nothing occurred prior to 2007, assuming we don't have regard in some way to the care proceedings and it strikes me that the European Court might not look at it as narrow, instead they might look at all these proceedings together for this purpose. I don't know. But let's assume we were just looking at in a national way and the proceedings we're looking at are the ones that began on October 2007.

30	p2,01:02:18.080,01:03:23.320,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: And in this case we're looking at a child's welfare, several years on into the proceedings. This point was considered, actually, My Lord, by Mr Justice Hedley in another case, the case of C v C, which is at tab 25 in the authority. So in my copy, that's volume two of the authority, tab 25. It is reported somewhere that we've got the [inaudible] report, and this is about a case in which a mother had been given permission to remove a child to Spain. A lot of the cases involve Spain. And the father subsequently brought further proceedings in England for contact with the child. Paragraph 12, the father's counsel says this. He says at all times, up to a letter, last summer, the mother fully participated in the proceedings. At all material times she was representative, took no issue on jurisdiction, even though the children must have been habitually resident in Spain for many months. It is true that the wording is in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized. That cannot, he contends, be narrowly construed since at the time of being seized, the issue of an application, a respondent may well have no knowledge of the matter. He submits to the court, absent express acceptance and has agreed that there is none here. Must look at the litigation, conduct and draw inferences from it. He estimated there is only one inference here, and that is now too late to object to jurisdiction of this current matter. Paragraph 16, halfway down the page, halfway down the paragraph, line seven, given that Miss Harding cannot challenge the fact on the mother's participation in the proceeding, she's for the mother, including an application whilst acting in person for an extension of time, the question can be further refined, and I think this is My Lord's point, can the mother be said to have accepted jurisdiction in an unequivocal map if she had never appreciated that it was able to challenge. It is that question that I'm required to answer. It would be unreal to think that the question of jurisdiction has never occurred to anyone. And I interject that in this case we know that it had. That said, however, I do accept Miss Harding's submission that no one ever saw it as a problem, and thus the mother did not specifically address in her mind an objection to it. In my judgement, the fundamental approach to this should be, what inference should be drawn from the mother's litigation conduct? The answer to that is clear. Complete acceptance. Then one should ask whether a failure to address the question of challenge vitiates what otherwise appears to be an unequivocal acceptance. I do not think it does. This case demonstrates a clear acceptance of the court's jurisdiction at least until late 2006, by which time, at any [inaudible] the court must be seized with the matter. Accordingly, it is then too late to object. In my judgement, the evidence demonstrates unequivocal participation in the proceedings and thus an acceptance of the jurisdiction. I do not think that the absence, as I'm prepared to accept it was, of advice on her right to object should vitiate the unequivocal acceptance otherwise is damaged. I'm glad to reach that view in this case, as questions of jurisdiction should be resolved at the outset of the case are not on the eve of the final hearing. That point of policy also fortifies my view that the court should be looking at what the partners have actually done, rather than the reasons or lack of them for doing it absent, of course, for misrepresentation. So that's the view of an extremely experienced judgment at first instance, addresses the very point Your Lordship was making.

30	p2,00:26:35.130,00:27:05.960,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: My submission to the court will be that it is, and may I come back to that My Lord? Because that is obviously a linked but different point. And again, towards the end of my submissions on this point, draw your attention back to the practise guide at page 12, tab 2 page 12, reminding ourselves, of course, this is only a persuasive authority, actually, it's 13. Top of the page, page 13. The question of jurisdiction is determined at the time the court is seized. Once a competent court is seized, in principle, it retains jurisdiction even if the child acquires habitual residence in another Member State during the course of the court proceeding. That, of course, is dealing with the Article 8 point and in my submission illustrates clearly the point that I've been making. Tab 2 page 13 top of the page. Now one of the factors which influenced the Court of Appeal's contrary interpretation was that it would preclude any party subsequently joined to the proceedings from having any right to refuse to accept jurisdiction. Obviously, parties can be added to the proceedings, all proceedings, not only family proceedings, and not infrequently are. And in this case, of course, the child as we've established was joined as a party to these proceedings. And Lord Justice Thorpe pointed out that if consent was confined to those parties who were parties at the outset of the proceedings, that would deprive a later joint party, in particular a child through the guardian, of the right to object to the court's jurisdiction. Well, My Lord, our response to that is, that's right, it does have that consequence, and the fact that it has that consequence does not, in our submission, in any way undermine the clear interpretation and meaning of the phrase. Parties added later cannot object, in our submission, to the jurisdiction. Although of course they can in this instance under the Children Act, invite the court not to make any order in the proceedings to which they have been joined. So we submit that Lord Justice Thorpe is right. It does have that consequence, but it is the clear consequence of the interpretation, which we say is absolutely absolutely clear on the words of the document.

30	p2,00:22:13.840,00:24:14.450,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: I don't think I can add to that debate, My Lady, because I've obviously been focusing on the more contentious aspects as far as [inaudible] is concerned. And so I turn to the other two hurdles, which I have to get over and the first is that the jurisdiction the court has been expressed accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seised. And there are two components of that which we need to consider. And the first I want to consider is at the time the court is seised. And of course, here there is a distinction between -- the issue is, does that refer to a specific event in time, meaning when the court is first seised, or a continuum of time, such a period of time as the court is seised? The Court of Appeal held that it meant the latter. It's our submission that it means the former. Although crucially, of course, later events are relevant in determining the position at the outset of the proceedings. We rely on a number of points in support of our preferred interpretation. We submit that the word, has been, in Article 12 (3) (b), is more consistent with a specific point in time. We point to the fact that under Article eight, the same phrase is used. Articulate the basic general jurisdiction. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of principle, over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seised. It is our submission to the court that the contrary interpretation would drain any meaning or effectiveness from the articles, because the crucial purpose of a jurisdictional rule, in our submission, is to determine whether the court has jurisdiction at the start of the proceedings, so they continue to determine the issue.
30	p4,00:21:18.560,00:23:56.680,spk_1,	True	Counsel: If I may, well I let me My Lord come to that now. There are a number of possible ways that it could be read. But looking at the sub article the date of seizing is with with respect clear from the four corners of the regulation by Article 16. Looking at the instant case one approach that My Lords could have is to say, well what on the basis of all the evidence was the position of the parties at the time of seizing? There we go back leaving aside for the moment questions of variation and continuation of proceedings which are interesting to the undertaking given by the father at the time of the relocation, and he is undertaking was to return the child if called upon to do so by the court, not in these proceedings. And it could have said in these proceedings but it didn't. By the court that is the English court. The father therefore, it might be said, was inevitably and following intensive proceedings in which he had been represented, making a concession for all the world to see and one which bound him on paying a possible imprisonment to respond obediently to requests from the English court. Now My Lords the use or the continued use of undertakings in relocation cases has been the subject of much interest to practitioners and of the occasional observation by judges, including in the Court of Appeal. And it's sometimes being said that their outmoded, particularly in cases where, for example, the Hague Child Abduction Convention applies. This is not one of those cases. It might be said that in the generality of cases in which the Brussels II revised regulation applies while they are outmoded or they're a clumsy way of achieving an end if what the court really has in mind is a reservation of jurisdiction.
30	p2,00:51:20.810,00:53:49.170,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Lord Collins' -- Lord Justice Lawrence's, at paragraph 53 on page 11. It is plain that Article 12 (1) (b) of Brussels II Revised when it speaks to the jurisdiction being quote, except expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized is not simply referring to a mere submission in matrimonial proceedings equivalent to what would be an entry of appearance under Brussels I Article 24. First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction to enrage the matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner. This must mean that accepting the jurisdiction of a court, other than that of a child's habitual residence, is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be [inaudible] by the parties at the time the proceedings are instituted. And then Your Lordship proceeded to recite the [inaudible] 12 to the regulation in paragraph 54. The first point, My Lord, we need to consider here, because in that case, the case turned on whether acknowledging the service effectively or whether the filing of a statement of arrangements in divorce proceedings amounted to consent. The court held not. The point I want to concentrate on is the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner, this must mean that acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be attributed by the parent at the time the proceedings are instituted. Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case.

30	p4,00:33:52.440,00:37:24.460,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Many years ago, this house and I'm afraid I've not put the authority before the house, considered the concept of retention in child abduction cases. It was H and S and the parties argued on the one hand, I said this house that house it was, on the one hand, the contention that retention was a continuing stage under the Hague Convention, one could pick the date that was most convenient for the parties to illustrate a point. Or in this case, a date following a contracting state entering the relevant convention. The House said no fixed terminus a quo, and one has to look at the earlier state of retention despite the word retention which carries with it a certain continuum. In this case, we suggest seizing is clear. It's got to be that early moment that the regulation doesn't give scope for any other interpretation. But an evaluation of jurisdiction will be based on material which of course will gradually grow with the progression of the proceedings. And this will be the case in every set of proceedings. It will grow first when a second party has joined in practical terms. Thus the document starting the proceedings is issued and served, and then in some proceedings, most proceedings, the party served will have the opportunity to respond. Then there will be a court appearance and then there may be submissions and there may be evidence. We suggest that there are a number of ways of looking at Article 12(3). One is to say yes, it's got to be determined at the moment of seising with such material as may be available at the moment of seising. So perhaps a judge who may be a judge at a very low level in a registry who receives a paper application will have to look at it and say, Well does Article 12(3) apply because there is a consent? In that case, there'd have to be a fairly radical overhaul of the way proceedings are started if people are to have the chance of accepting or not accepting. A second possibility is that which I've postulated as the rabbit pulled out of the hat. A third is to say the date is the date of seising. One can look at material, which comes to light subsequent to that, but rather as one would in public law care proceedings. One has to look back to that particular date to see what the position was then. There's an argument that in this case, such a test would be satisfied because of the undertakings given in the relocation in proceedings.
30	p4,00:30:23.720,00:31:15.860,spk_1,	True	Counsel: I hope I haven't fallen flat. If one looks carefully at Article 12(3)(b) and one reads it in this way. The jurisdiction of the court has been, past tense, accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner, and I'm now going to read it with an emphasis, By all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. So, in other words, that's a description, not at the time at which there must be the express acceptance, but the time at which the constituent parties who have to give their consent are counted.
30	p3,01:11:39.310,01:12:29.170,spk_5,	True	The Court: There are various alternative ways of looking at it depending on which of your various submissions we accept. Suppose for a moment we accept the view that the court is seised at the moment of the moment identified in Article 16 which is at the time when the document instituting the proceedings is launched with the court. Now in that analysis, assuming that there is nothing occurred prior to 2007, assuming we don't have regard in some way to the care proceedings and it strikes me that the European Court might not look at it as narrow, instead they might look at all these proceedings together for this purpose. I don't know. But let's assume we were just looking at in a national way and the proceedings we're looking at are the ones that began on October 2007.

I know you don't accept that. But assuming that we are correct, contrary to your argument, then we need to identify what that moment is. The moment is that identified as I see it, speaking entirely for myself, by Article 16. So, we have to look at the moment when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court. And that was in 31st of October 2007 or maybe a day or two later. So, on that hypothesis, we will be focusing would be only on the question whether there had been an acceptance.

31	p2,01:10:15.330,01:10:34.060,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: Yes, in my submission, the only reasonable and practical construction is that that falls to be considered at the time the court is seized, i.e. at the outset of the proceedings, and it's not something which falls to be considered at all points during the course of the proceedings. The reason for that is the purposive argument that the purpose of Article 12 is to enable the court to determine whether it has jurisdiction and in my submission, it would be manifestly unworkable if the court were required, the instance of any party to review the question whether it still has jurisdiction at all stages of the proceedings. Either the court has jurisdiction or it does not.

Well, if the court has to ask itself, Have I got jurisdiction. If the court did do that in this case until very late in the day. But if it asks at the outset, do I have jurisdiction? Then one of the questions the judge has to consider is do the parties agree or have they unequivocally accepted? If they haven't unequivocally accepted, that them to the election. Do you agree? If they say no, then he doesn't have jurisdiction under Article 12 3. If they say yes, then he does, and that's the end of it.

31	p4,00:26:11.140,00:27:41.310,spk_1,	True	Counsel: That wasn't done in this case, and I have to say from experience it tends not to be done, save by rare first instance judges, in any case. Taking it forward if one considers the effect of Article 17 of the revised regulation. Article 17, coupled together with Article 18 provides a positive onus on judges to consider jurisdiction at the earliest possible stage and realistically, there's a limit to the scope for that to be done when proceedings are launched. And that comes to the analysis of the interplay between the different aspects of Article 12(3)(b) and that is to say accepted express or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. At the time the court is seized, it may well be that there is only one active party. The other party won't necessarily have had the chance to say anything at all. And there is a difficulty at the moment with that. It's a difficulty which some practitioners address by writing on a document acknowledging service, that acknowledgement is made subject to a challenge to jurisdiction.

But by agreement, parties can, in essence, impose the jurisdiction of Member States on a non Member State where a child is resident because that's the essence of what will happen. The court here will decide the case, and if the court decides, or the court in France or the court in Belgium will decide the case, and will then make orders which are to be carried out in a third country, or we, would say, in a non Member State and that that can't possibly have been within the remit or the consideration of the European community when it was drafting this regulation, there's nothing that indicates that it was.

32	p2,00:42:53.900,00:44:41.110,Appellant ,	True	Counsel: It does. I was going to go through Article 15 as it clearly is of interest. By way of exception, I underline that, where the Courts Member State having jurisdiction, so it's after jurisdiction is established, as to the substance of a matter, may, if they consider that a Court of another Member State with which the court has a particular connection, I'm underlining words which may be of interest to have a longer discussion about this, will be at a better place to hear the case, or a specific part thereof, and where this is in the best interest of the child, stay the case or the part thereof, and invite the parties to introduce a request or request a court of another Member State to assume jurisdiction according to paragraph 5. Paragraph 1 should apply upon the application from a party or if the courts are in motion, or upon the application from a court of another Member State with which the child has a particular connection in accordance with paragraph 3. A transfer made of the Court's own motion or the application of a court of a Member State must be accepted by at least one of the parties, so you can't do it if all the parties are against. The child shall be considered to have a particular connection, if -- there is a list of five factors in three. Four, the court of a Member State, having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter shall set a time limit by which the courts of that other Member State shall be seised in accordance with paragraph 1. If the courts are not seised by that time, the court which has been seised shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. In other words, if they refused the request or don't comply with the time limit, then the Court, the requesting Court, shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in the Court, 8 to 14. The courts of that other Member State may, due to the circumstance of the case, that this is in the best interests of the child, accept within six weeks of their seisure in accordance with paragraphs 1 (a) or (b). In this case, the Court first seised shall decline jurisdiction. Otherwise, the court first seised shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. The courts shall cooperate for the purposes of the Article. That's, in my submission, quite a complex framework for what I call consensual transfer from one court to another. It follows on, but in greater detail, the provisions of Article 10 of the 96 Convention to which which we looked at earlier. It's not the same as the English Court saying, I don't think this court is the best court. I'm going to stay the proceedings on the assumption the proceedings will be transferred to a non Member State.

32	p3,00:27:59.680,00:30:29.540,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It seems, if I can elaborate what I'm saying at the moment, my Lord, I think it might explain what I'm trying to say about the incongruity of Article 12 being the only situation in which it would be considered apposite for parents to choose jurisdiction even if the child is not living within that jurisdiction and that is that part of the raison d'etre behind the regulation is the enforcement of judgments and the recognition of judgments. And if parents choose to deal with a country, whatever the country is be it Pakistan, be it United States of America, be it the Ukraine where the child lives, be it Jamaica. One can think of many countries that have very close connections with this country where children quite often live long term with extended family members, either after public law proceedings or within private law proceedings. And the parents choose this country or another country within the United -- within the European Union to be the jurisdiction to hear the case, when it's patently obvious that the other court may not neither recognise the judgement nor enforce it. And how that supports the generality and the specific desire of this aim, I think is the proper term of the regulation, which is also set out in the guidance, it's hard to explain and I think is incongruent, because even if enforcement is not the main priority, it's certainly a priority, and for parents to be able to choose not to have a case heard where their child is living and nothing can be done about the result, whatever the result is, even if it's the right result in inverted commas, seems to be totally outside the aims of this regulation.
