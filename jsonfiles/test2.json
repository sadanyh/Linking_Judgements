At issue in this case are the principles which should guide the exercise of the court's discretion in deciding whether to order a child to attend to give evidence in family proceedings. The current approach was stated by Smith LJ in LM v Medway Council, RM and YM [2007] EWCA Civ 9, [2007] 1 FLR 1698, at para 44: \"The correct starting point . . . is that it is undesirable that a child should have to give evidence in care proceedings and that particular justification will be required before that course is taken. There will be some cases in which it will be right to make an order. In my view they will be rare.\" She went on to explain the factors which should guide the judge in considering whether to make the order, at para 45: \". . . the judge will have to balance the need for the evidence in the circumstances of the case against what he assesses to be the potential for harm to the child. In assessing the need for oral evidence . . . the judge should, in my view, take account of the importance of the evidence to the process of his decision about the child's future. It may be that the child's future cannot satisfactorily be determined without that evidence. In assessing the risk of harm or oppression, the judge should take heed of current research into the effect on children of giving evidence and should not rely only upon his impression of the child, although that will of course be relevant.\" 2. That approach was based upon the earlier authority of Butler-Sloss LJ in R v B County Council, ex parte P [1991] 1 WLR 221 and Wilson J in Re P (Witness Summons) [1997] 2 FLR 447. It was endorsed by Wilson LJ in the Medway case and by Wall and Thorpe LJJ in SW v Portsmouth City Council; Re W (children: concurrent care and criminal proceedings) [2009] EWCA 644, [2009] 3 FCR 1. And it was followed by Wall and Wilson LJJ in their joint judgment in the present case: [2010] EWCA Civ 57. Each had previously stated that in all their years of experience in the Family Division of the High Court he had never heard oral evidence from a child in care proceedings. That is also my own experience. 3. The complaint, very moderately advanced by Mr Geekie QC, [HS1]is that a \"starting point\" [HS2]of undesirability, placing the burden upon the person wishing to cross-examine a child to show some \"particular justification\" for doing so, gives insufficient weight to the Convention rights of all concerned. 1 4. All the parties in care proceedings are entitled to a fair hearing in the determination of their civil rights and obligations the parents who stand to lose their children if allegations of abuse are made out, the children who stand to lose their parents if allegations of abuse are made out, but also stand to suffer abuse or further abuse if they are left at home because those allegations cannot be proved. And it is not only their article 6 rights which are in play. The civil rights in issue are also Convention rights in themselves the right to respect for the family lives of the parents and their children but also the right to respect for the private lives of the children, which include their rights to be protected from attacks upon their physical and psychological integrity: X and Y v The Netherlands (1986) 8 EHRR 235.  Even a \"stranger\" child, whose future is not in issue in the proceedings but whose statements are relevant, has privacy interests which deserve respect. 4. Hence, argues Mr Geekie, there should be no starting point or presumption that such cases will be rare Instead, the court should adopt the approach explained by Lord Steyn in In re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) [2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 AC 593, at para 17, when balancing of the right to respect for private and family life in article 8 and the right to freedom of expression in article 10:\"First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values of the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each.\" Mr Geekie understands that article 6 is not a qualified right in the same way that article 8 is a qualified right, but he accepts that what is entailed in a fair hearing in Childen Act proceedings will have to take account of the article 8 rights of all concerned. All he asks for is \"an intense focus\" upon their comparative importance rather than an assumption that the one will almost always trump the other. 2.", "Trancription": [{"time": "00:04:40.770,00:06:20.630,spk_3,", "text": "In a parallel process going on, at the same time, chronologically cases leading to the Children Act 1989 made clear that hearsay was not admissible in cases concerning children other than in wardship. And in the written documentation in the Bundles, we've produced the case of Re(H), Re(K), which was the decision of the Court of Appeal in relation to, statutory proceedings, private law proceedings as the children. And that judgment made clear that, as I say chronologically in the lead up to the Children Act 1989 the courts decided that hearsay was not admissible in children proceedings. A parallel and similar decision was made in the Bradford case, in relation to proceedings in the juvenile court, the venue for care proceedings prior to implementation of the Children Act.

There's nothing that I seek to derived from them in particular, other than just setting us in the historical context of, here say not being admissible other than in wardship As we move towards the Act of 1989. What is of interest we submit is that those two cases H and K in particular led directly to a late amendment to the Children's Bill, adding Section 96 as we now see it, and it might give assistance.

And that's something to which we've given considerable consideration as to whether or not we should make a claim that an Article 6 right has any greater claim in a balancing exercise and after consideration. It was our decision, I hope not wrongly, but our decision that it would not be appropriate to seek to argue that the father's Article 6 right in a situation such as this had any prior claim in relation to Article 8 rights and really two reasons underlying that decision are firstly, I believe the most appropriate language is to say that although after 60 non qualified right is not an absolute right, and so if that's the law in relation to Article 6, it begins to make the position difficult to claim a prior position for Article 6. But secondly, the Article 6 rights are in these cases spread across the parties and because the child, the child witness, has her Article 6 rights and the siblings have their Article 6 rights to a fair hearing. And so in any event, there's going to be a levelling between the parties in relation to their Article 6 rights. And indeed, we've so far, I've just been addressing the situation where one has a child, witnesses who are parties. One also, of course, has to think about child witnesses who are strangers to litigation. They will have rights to engage in the litigation.

Yeah, but I would respectfully submit that when one examines in a little more detail what was said within the section I'm at in the Pigott report, more was being said than just that. A bold statement that children giving evidence will cause them harm. Can I go on to Paragraph 2 (15) And the background 2 (15) really began with the criminal case of Woolwork, which was the case where the Lord Chief Justice said that children the evidence of a child aged five could not be received, and the concern that was that the evidence of young children wasn't being received either because of legal practise or because parents or guardians were not content to their children to go before a court without any form of protection. So if I can just read six lines or so into Paragraph 2 (15). We also received evidence and police officers and social workers that many hundreds of cases cannot be pursued successfully each year because children seem unlikely to make effective or legally competent witnesses under under present circumstances. As a result, some child victims are left with feelings of anger, resentment, frustration and even guilt, which many experts believe could be to some extent dispelled by legal procedures which enable them to speak fully and freely and when judged against the progression of Court of Appeal cases in family law as to the effect on children giving evidence, that we respect, that suggested the most interesting comments because it shows that under appropriate circumstances, there is the possibility of good effect arising from children being given a voice in proceedings clearly criminal proceedings in this context.

Conflicted cross examination about the details of the event itself may be very unproductive. It may have a different impact on in front of a jury, I don't know. But many take the view that to examine surrounding detail to examine points which can reveal whether the child is reliable or not and can reveal context and background can be more productive. And the point about that cross examination is it's less likely to be traumatising for the child. It's not one of the key concerns, of course. This is asking the child have to relive the event, and that is a supremely sensitive arena. Other questions which can be revealing, can be illuminating, for the tribunal can be in relation to aspects which are less difficult for the child. And so I simply invite the court not to approach on the basis of it has to be a you did. You didn't in relation to the the events themselves, but there can be much more that can be revealed and of assistance to the tribunal of fact. Well, My Lady, turning to the alternative proposals about other means in which this might be done. I've made submission already in relation to what we say about the standing or position of the work to be done by the family justice counsel in relation to this hearing. I don't propose to go over that submission again. The court has our position on that. Of course, I would accept that the Family Justice Council will be able to not only provide a depth and breadth of evidence, but also they will be able to advise on policy and practice. And all of that might inform future practice. What has been in a sense canvas before this court in the course of yesterday afternoon and today is the possibility of some form of Section 28 of the Youth Justice Act, which has not been brought in crime of the prerecorded cross examination being deployed within family proceedings. My Lord, I simply say in relation to that that that does seem to us with respect to involve such broad issues of policy and practice that although it might be something upon which this court could pass comment as to, the virtue of further investigation, as did indoor indeed did. Lord Justice Wall in S and W and W. We would respectfully suggest it would be. It's difficult to see how it could be a direct outcome of a hearing such of this, which is concentrating upon a specific legal test. May I just touch briefly on three or a couple of final short subjects? The question has arisen about the father's position in relation to any further application arising out of the interview. The Child on the 13th of January, 13th of January. My Lord, it's been quite impossible to contemplate putting that issue before Judge Marshall, because at all stages since the 13th of January, the question is to the appropriate test that Judge Marshall should have to apply if she had to reconsider. The matter has been under judicial scrutiny, as at the 13th of January, the Court of Appeal decision was pending that was promulgated, I believe on the ninth of February, and within days of that, this court has granted permission for the matter to come back to this court. So it's been quite impossible to invite Judge Marshall to reconsider that issue without her having available to her the test that she should apply."}, {"time": "01:46:42.050,01:48:00.590,spk_3,", "text": "the report as to what to happen is extremely short that simply reflects the newness of it is a very short letter from the Family Justice Council, which simply says that Lord Justice Thorpe is setting up a multi multi disciplinary committee has proposed by Lord Justice, Wall and Wilson.

Sorry, could you say that again? An equal starting point for all competing interests and the -- of course, one can't begin to list all competing interests that might arise, but judges can be cautioned or advised to be alert to the Article 6 and 8 rights of witnesses, and in the way that My Lady, we've canvassed already, that would apply to different -- witnesses in the three different positions before the Court. The Article 6 and 8 rights of parents, and the Article 6 and 8 rights of siblings. And if one sets those as separate categories as the appropriate path to begin thinking about, that at least gives a decision-making judge in an individual case the right ambit of decisions to consider. The present authorities rely significantly upon the, as Lord Justice Wilson put it, the yardstick of oppression, we've traced through the origins of oppression as a test in issuing a witness summons, just -- I haven't gone through it in detail, but it goes back to the ITN case and Morgan v Morgan within family proceedings, and we've done that simply because, this Court may wish to consider whether or not oppression is too clumsy a test. It may be that when one is looking at the welfare of the child, things short of oppression should be taken into account.
