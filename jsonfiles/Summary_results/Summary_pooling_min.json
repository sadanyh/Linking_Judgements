At issue in this case are the principles which should guide the exercise of the court's discretion in deciding whether to order a child to attend to give evidence in family proceedings. The current approach was stated by Smith LJ in LM v Medway Council, RM and YM [2007] EWCA Civ 9, [2007] 1 FLR 1698, at para 44: \"The correct starting point . . . is that it is undesirable that a child should have to give evidence in care proceedings and that particular justification will be required before that course is taken. There will be some cases in which it will be right to make an order. In my view they will be rare.\" She went on to explain the factors which should guide the judge in considering whether to make the order, at para 45: \". . . the judge will have to balance the need for the evidence in the circumstances of the case against what he assesses to be the potential for harm to the child. In assessing the need for oral evidence . . . the judge should, in my view, take account of the importance of the evidence to the process of his decision about the child's future. It may be that the child's future cannot satisfactorily be determined without that evidence. In assessing the risk of harm or oppression, the judge should take heed of current research into the effect on children of giving evidence and should not rely only upon his impression of the child, although that will of course be relevant.\" 2. That approach was based upon the earlier authority of Butler-Sloss LJ in R v B County Council, ex parte P [1991] 1 WLR 221 and Wilson J in Re P (Witness Summons) [1997] 2 FLR 447. It was endorsed by Wilson LJ in the Medway case and by Wall and Thorpe LJJ in SW v Portsmouth City Council; Re W (children: concurrent care and criminal proceedings) [2009] EWCA 644, [2009] 3 FCR 1. And it was followed by Wall and Wilson LJJ in their joint judgment in the present case: [2010] EWCA Civ 57. Each had previously stated that in all their years of experience in the Family Division of the High Court he had never heard oral evidence from a child in care proceedings. That is also my own experience. 3. The complaint, very moderately advanced by Mr Geekie QC, [HS1]is that a \"starting point\" [HS2]of undesirability, placing the burden upon the person wishing to cross-examine a child to show some \"particular justification\" for doing so, gives insufficient weight to the Convention rights of all concerned. 1 4. All the parties in care proceedings are entitled to a fair hearing in the determination of their civil rights and obligations the parents who stand to lose their children if allegations of abuse are made out, the children who stand to lose their parents if allegations of abuse are made out, but also stand to suffer abuse or further abuse if they are left at home because those allegations cannot be proved. And it is not only their article 6 rights which are in play. The civil rights in issue are also Convention rights in themselves the right to respect for the family lives of the parents and their children but also the right to respect for the private lives of the children, which include their rights to be protected from attacks upon their physical and psychological integrity: X and Y v The Netherlands (1986) 8 EHRR 235.  Even a \"stranger\" child, whose future is not in issue in the proceedings but whose statements are relevant, has privacy interests which deserve respect. 4. Hence, argues Mr Geekie, there should be no starting point or presumption that such cases will be rare Instead, the court should adopt the approach explained by Lord Steyn in In re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) [2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 AC 593, at para 17, when balancing of the right to respect for private and family life in article 8 and the right to freedom of expression in article 10:\"First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values of the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each.\" Mr Geekie understands that article 6 is not a qualified right in the same way that article 8 is a qualified right, but he accepts that what is entailed in a fair hearing in Childen Act proceedings will have to take account of the article 8 rights of all concerned. All he asks for is \"an intense focus\" upon their comparative importance rather than an assumption that the one will almost always trump the other. 2.",

			"text": "I believe we have a firm answer to that, so I hope it's a satisfactory one. The position your ladyship postulates, applies already in relation to a child and criminal proceedings that that if the child is asking all the investigator feels obliged to explain, then the child would have to be told you'll probably have to give oral evidence at a criminal trial. If this gives rise to an allegation of crime, you're likely to have to give evidence. And indeed, the very ABE interview in this case starts off as early on in it, a discussion with a child about the fact that you may have to give evidence in a court. So insofar as there is that concern as to the impact upon children, generally, it's within the system, and it's difficult to see why an investigator or social worker would be able to put on the child's behalf, filter out what you might have to do with in criminal proceedings of what you might have to do with in family proceedings. But secondly, perhaps more importantly, we resist very firmly any suggestion that the anyway behind our underlying disappear. All these submissions is a suggestion that children should have to give evidence in criminal proceedings more often. And the local authority directly say in their case, Statement of Case, that if this appeal is correct, then it will lead to a presumption that a child should have to give evidence. And we with great respect say absolutely not. All we are saying, is that when considering this issue, all competing interests should be evaluated from a level starting point because the competing interests are separately so important that it's wrong to rank them prior to consideration. And it's not convention compliant, We will say anyway will develop in a moment, and so you start from a level basis, and that does not lead to conclusion that there'll be a presumption that a child should give evidence what a court will do, what the individual judge will do in the individual"

The first, because one would be -- having to put it in the context of what has gone to date, the first statement would be a clear statement of an equal starting point for all competing interests. Sorry, could you say that again? An equal starting point for all competing interests and the -- of course, one can't begin to list all competing interests that might arise, but judges can be cautioned or advised to be alert to the Article 6 and 8 rights of witnesses, and in the way that My Lady, we've canvassed already, that would apply to different -- witnesses in the three different positions before the Court. The Article 6 and 8 rights of parents, and the Article 6 and 8 rights of siblings. And if one sets those as separate categories as the appropriate path to begin thinking about, that at least gives a decision-making judge in an individual case the right ambit of decisions to consider. The present authorities rely significantly upon the, as Lord Justice Wilson put it, the yardstick of oppression, we've traced through the origins of oppression as a test in issuing a witness summons, just -- I haven't gone through it in detail, but it goes back to the ITN case and Morgan v Morgan within family proceedings, and we've done that simply because, this Court may wish to consider whether or not oppression is too clumsy a test. It may be that when one is looking at the welfare of the child, things short of oppression should be taken into account. So, there is -- certainly there's no, we would submit, there's no binding authority on this Court that says oppression must stay in, and the Court may wish or need to consider whether a more flexible test in looking at the child's welfare might be appropriate."

			"text": "those in the light of submissions that have been made. My Lord, may I make a brief comment upon just a few matters that have been raised Firstly, the discussion that has taken place in relation to the ABE interview and its status as the best evidence. I don't contend the proposition for one moment that in the case of a child who has been abused, it is likely to be the best evidence. But the difficulties we apprehend it is that it does not deal with the difficulty of testing in an account, which may not be true, so that that is the heart of the difficulty for those cases where there really is an issue as to reliability. The ABE interview, because of the careful manner in which it is, produced, may disguise rather than reveal difficulties. May I just say a word about some of the exchanges that took place in relation to what was styled very loosely. I appreciate the old Bailey cross examination, but certainly I'm sure we all understood what was intended by that loose styling in a criminal case. It may well be that there are limitations upon the degree to which a Crown Court judge can intervene the reasons for that particular to the jury trial. But in the family case, we certainly would accept that a family judge has a continuing duty to safeguard the welfare of a child who is a child witness and in those circumstances, in the way that was canvas to a degree in submissions, I think particular between myself and My Lord, Lord Kerr, it would be the duty or certainly available to him, probably the duty of the family judge, too. Be more interventionist in relation to the way in which cross examination is conducted, and certainly if one is, I appreciate My Lady has raised other matters about how these things can be done, and I'll come to that in just a moment. But if one is thinking in terms of cross examination will be through, albeit through a live link, this court could make clear we would submit that it is the duty of the judge to continue to control the process. A live point of that is the point that I made yesterday about the status of the child, who is a simple witness, what I call the stranger child. And there any Article 8 rights they have. The way in which I hope will certainly intended to put that is that it's that individual, that child before the court, has a right to respect for private life, and these processes are intrusive into private life total that extent that child has, the court has to look to that child's right. That consideration will be considerably more circumscribed when one is the subject child. But the point is that in any case of any child witness before the court, the judge would have a continuing duty and therefore would be obliged to have control over the way in which the cross examination proceeds.

This child was video interviewed on the day that she made her complaint at school, and so that that is, that is the guidance to get it done as soon as possible. So it is captures the child, child's account as fresh as possible. And so firstly, there is no opportunity to at all to know how any person might respond to it, because it's the first caption of that evidence. And indeed, under the guidance of the ABE interview procedure for an interviewer to seek to challenge or to put another person's account would be regarded as wholly wrong. That is not the purpose, and the purpose is to have the child to give the account. And, My Lord, that that summary of how these things happen does impact come back into the point that my lady, My Lord Browne, we're making about the wider impact of these cases, that that's how they often start. And that is in my submission when one looks at it from that perspective, gives some reassurance that the anxiety which the court rightly raises with me is not likely to apply in practise because these interviews are almost inevitably led by the police.

I mean, I began by saying the test have a clear statement of an equal starting point, and that's obviously a distillation from that, and then of course, insofar as any alleviation measures can be taken, they should be taken. There's no reason that -- where children do give evidence in family proceedings it is done by video link and matters of that sort. And then, of course, any test would have to set out clearly the caution which would be necessary if the hearsay evidence is received by the Court, untested by cross examination, and that is found to be expressed in the authorities but perhaps not in the way that it should be. It's most articulately expressed, most urgently expressed by Lord Justice Nichols in The Crown v B. And then, My Lady, in all that I've just said there is, we would submit, nothing, which creates a presumption in the opposite direction, but it would provide, we submit,  a clear and open way in which a judge could be assisted in coming to the right decision on what are always going to be extremely difficult"

It should be neutral. The test itself should be neutral as to outcome. So it is wrong in principle to have a test which express rarity as part of the very formulation. And we made criticism of the second bullet point. There's a starting point that is well, it was characterised by Lord Justice Reimer in the Court of Appeals in this case as a presumption, and we certainly submit it has that flavour and that character that that is a starting point. If it's a starting point, it's a presumption. And if there were any doubt about that, when we move on to a particular justification, we submit that one can probably ask. Well, who is to do the justifying? And the answer must be. It's for the respondent father to show a particular justification is why, despite the starting point, despite the expression of rarity, the child should have to give evidence, oral evidence. And so that, again is an indication that there's a presumption which has got to be rebutted by the father. Why"
