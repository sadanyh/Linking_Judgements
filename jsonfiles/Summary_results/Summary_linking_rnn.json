At issue in this case are the principles which should guide the exercise of the court's discretion in deciding whether to order a child to attend to give evidence in family proceedings. The current approach was stated by Smith LJ in LM v Medway Council, RM and YM [2007] EWCA Civ 9, [2007] 1 FLR 1698, at para 44: \"The correct starting point . . . is that it is undesirable that a child should have to give evidence in care proceedings and that particular justification will be required before that course is taken. There will be some cases in which it will be right to make an order. In my view they will be rare.\" She went on to explain the factors which should guide the judge in considering whether to make the order, at para 45: \". . . the judge will have to balance the need for the evidence in the circumstances of the case against what he assesses to be the potential for harm to the child. In assessing the need for oral evidence . . . the judge should, in my view, take account of the importance of the evidence to the process of his decision about the child's future. It may be that the child's future cannot satisfactorily be determined without that evidence. In assessing the risk of harm or oppression, the judge should take heed of current research into the effect on children of giving evidence and should not rely only upon his impression of the child, although that will of course be relevant.\" 2. That approach was based upon the earlier authority of Butler-Sloss LJ in R v B County Council, ex parte P [1991] 1 WLR 221 and Wilson J in Re P (Witness Summons) [1997] 2 FLR 447. It was endorsed by Wilson LJ in the Medway case and by Wall and Thorpe LJJ in SW v Portsmouth City Council; Re W (children: concurrent care and criminal proceedings) [2009] EWCA 644, [2009] 3 FCR 1. And it was followed by Wall and Wilson LJJ in their joint judgment in the present case: [2010] EWCA Civ 57. Each had previously stated that in all their years of experience in the Family Division of the High Court he had never heard oral evidence from a child in care proceedings. That is also my own experience. 3. The complaint, very moderately advanced by Mr Geekie QC, [HS1]is that a \"starting point\" [HS2]of undesirability, placing the burden upon the person wishing to cross-examine a child to show some \"particular justification\" for doing so, gives insufficient weight to the Convention rights of all concerned. 1 4. All the parties in care proceedings are entitled to a fair hearing in the determination of their civil rights and obligations the parents who stand to lose their children if allegations of abuse are made out, the children who stand to lose their parents if allegations of abuse are made out, but also stand to suffer abuse or further abuse if they are left at home because those allegations cannot be proved. And it is not only their article 6 rights which are in play. The civil rights in issue are also Convention rights in themselves the right to respect for the family lives of the parents and their children but also the right to respect for the private lives of the children, which include their rights to be protected from attacks upon their physical and psychological integrity: X and Y v The Netherlands (1986) 8 EHRR 235.  Even a \"stranger\" child, whose future is not in issue in the proceedings but whose statements are relevant, has privacy interests which deserve respect. 4. Hence, argues Mr Geekie, there should be no starting point or presumption that such cases will be rare Instead, the court should adopt the approach explained by Lord Steyn in In re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) [2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 AC 593, at para 17, when balancing of the right to respect for private and family life in article 8 and the right to freedom of expression in article 10:\"First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values of the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each.\" Mr Geekie understands that article 6 is not a qualified right in the same way that article 8 is a qualified right, but he accepts that what is entailed in a fair hearing in Childen Act proceedings will have to take account of the article 8 rights of all concerned. All he asks for is \"an intense focus\" upon their comparative importance rather than an assumption that the one will almost always trump the other. 2.",

The first, because one would be -- having to put it in the context of what has gone to date, the first statement would be a clear statement of an equal starting point for all competing interests. Sorry, could you say that again? An equal starting point for all competing interests and the -- of course, one can't begin to list all competing interests that might arise, but judges can be cautioned or advised to be alert to the Article 6 and 8 rights of witnesses, and in the way that My Lady, we've canvassed already, that would apply to different -- witnesses in the three different positions before the Court. The Article 6 and 8 rights of parents, and the Article 6 and 8 rights of siblings. And if one sets those as separate categories as the appropriate path to begin thinking about, that at least gives a decision-making judge in an individual case the right ambit of decisions to consider. The present authorities rely significantly upon the, as Lord Justice Wilson put it, the yardstick of oppression, we've traced through the origins of oppression as a test in issuing a witness summons, just -- I haven't gone through it in detail, but it goes back to the ITN case and Morgan v Morgan within family proceedings, and we've done that simply because, this Court may wish to consider whether or not oppression is too clumsy a test. It may be that when one is looking at the welfare of the child, things short of oppression should be taken into account. So, there is -- certainly there's no, we would submit, there's no binding authority on this Court that says oppression must stay in, and the Court may wish or need to consider whether a more flexible test in looking at the child's welfare might be appropriate."

We still have a situation where the the the evidence base as it is, is that the giving of evidence is harmful, and we are not in a situation, we do not have the evidence, to say it would be all right if only we adopted a special measures approach. We simply don't have that evidence, and that is something that maybe the Family Justice Council could address. So, the local authority would say that, when the authorities as they are, take as their starting point the assumption is we do not call children because it's harmful, because it's traumatic, that assumption is not an assumption plucked out of the air. It's an assumption based on the evidence as it is at the moment."

The court has a responsibility to consider that child's welfare in a way that they courts often have to consider welfare for older witnesses who may be learning disabled. And it does. It does crop up in different situations, and those young people who may be over 18 but have learning difficulties equally would need careful and special consideration. And so estimate the the the child witness who is not not a party to proceedings does have Article 8 rights to privacy because of the nature of the allegations and the intrusive nature of the testing of evidence in this sort of case. But depending on the particular facts, a particular case a judge might come to a different decision if the child were a stranger child, if the child were the only subject child of those proceedings. And so when all that I would respectfully submit is consistent with an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed, that any potential witness who can articulate a claim is deserves that intense focus and and that's what should be undertaken and their status within the proceedings will be a factor and may or may not influence the decision as to whether or not they should give evidence."

The inquisitorial nature of childrens' proceedings applies in private law proceedings, as much as it does in care proceedings, there may not be authority for that proposition, but it's obviously correct. Absolutely. I don't believe it to be controversial, Mr Geekie will tell me if he thinks it is, so the judge would, or the court, would be in charge in the same way, as to what to do about a particular piece of hearsay evidence, and how to arrange for it to be challenged if the judge thought that that was necessary, in the circumstances. But in terms of, if you set, and I think we are very much in line behind the local authority in terms of favouring some clarification from this Court about the current position, those considerations will apply equally in the private law arena. And I do think we have to have strongly in mind, when there is a suggestion that there shouldn't be a starting point, and I think it really goes to that point, if you start with a blank canvas, as suggested by Mr Geekie, and you just factor in all of the issues as you go, we think there is a real risk of importing into the private law arena, a completely inappropriate involvement by the child in the evidence building process."

I perhaps don't need to spend too long at this stage. But just picking up my Lord, Lord Browne's points right off and 6 a little further. The the Article 6 right is an unqualified but not an absolute right. But the right when one analyse it through the convention Case law is to overall fairness in the proceedings. So the court has to stand well back and look at the overall effect within the proceedings. And it's for that reason that if one looks at the various convention cases on that subject, in some instances, hearsay evidence is admissible in some instances, not it doesn't track the Article 6 right doesn't translate into any necessary result. One has to look at the overall fairness and that's why we say that one has to measure each of these factors in an even way. And"

And so the simple submission we make is there needs to be an intense focus on the position of those younger siblings, and the position without a doubt is all the present authorities are silent on that subject, so if nothing else, under as it were the second global heading of our argument, it's something which needs, whatever the overall framework of the test, it's something which needs very clearly to be articulated, that there can be separate factors to be considered for younger siblings."

It was our decision, I hope not wrongly, but our decision that it would not be appropriate to seek to argue that the father's Article 6 right in a situation such as this had any prior claim in relation to Article 8 rights and really two reasons underlying that decision are firstly, I believe the most appropriate language is to say that although after 60 non qualified right is not an absolute right, and so if that's the law in relation to Article 6, it begins to make the position difficult to claim a prior position for Article 6. But secondly, the Article 6 rights are in these cases spread across the parties and because the child, the child witness, has her Article 6 rights and the siblings have their Article 6 rights to a fair hearing. And so in any event, there's going to be a levelling between the parties in relation to their Article 6 rights. And indeed, we've so far, I've just been addressing the situation where one has a child, witnesses who are parties. One also, of course, has to think about child witnesses who are strangers to litigation. They will have rights to engage in the litigation. Are"
