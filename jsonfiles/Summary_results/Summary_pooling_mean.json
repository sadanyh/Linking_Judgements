At issue in this case are the principles which should guide the exercise of the court's discretion in deciding whether to order a child to attend to give evidence in family proceedings. The current approach was stated by Smith LJ in LM v Medway Council, RM and YM [2007] EWCA Civ 9, [2007] 1 FLR 1698, at para 44: \"The correct starting point . . . is that it is undesirable that a child should have to give evidence in care proceedings and that particular justification will be required before that course is taken. There will be some cases in which it will be right to make an order. In my view they will be rare.\" She went on to explain the factors which should guide the judge in considering whether to make the order, at para 45: \". . . the judge will have to balance the need for the evidence in the circumstances of the case against what he assesses to be the potential for harm to the child. In assessing the need for oral evidence . . . the judge should, in my view, take account of the importance of the evidence to the process of his decision about the child's future. It may be that the child's future cannot satisfactorily be determined without that evidence. In assessing the risk of harm or oppression, the judge should take heed of current research into the effect on children of giving evidence and should not rely only upon his impression of the child, although that will of course be relevant.\" 2. That approach was based upon the earlier authority of Butler-Sloss LJ in R v B County Council, ex parte P [1991] 1 WLR 221 and Wilson J in Re P (Witness Summons) [1997] 2 FLR 447. It was endorsed by Wilson LJ in the Medway case and by Wall and Thorpe LJJ in SW v Portsmouth City Council; Re W (children: concurrent care and criminal proceedings) [2009] EWCA 644, [2009] 3 FCR 1. And it was followed by Wall and Wilson LJJ in their joint judgment in the present case: [2010] EWCA Civ 57. Each had previously stated that in all their years of experience in the Family Division of the High Court he had never heard oral evidence from a child in care proceedings. That is also my own experience. 3. The complaint, very moderately advanced by Mr Geekie QC, [HS1]is that a \"starting point\" [HS2]of undesirability, placing the burden upon the person wishing to cross-examine a child to show some \"particular justification\" for doing so, gives insufficient weight to the Convention rights of all concerned. 1 4. All the parties in care proceedings are entitled to a fair hearing in the determination of their civil rights and obligations the parents who stand to lose their children if allegations of abuse are made out, the children who stand to lose their parents if allegations of abuse are made out, but also stand to suffer abuse or further abuse if they are left at home because those allegations cannot be proved. And it is not only their article 6 rights which are in play. The civil rights in issue are also Convention rights in themselves the right to respect for the family lives of the parents and their children but also the right to respect for the private lives of the children, which include their rights to be protected from attacks upon their physical and psychological integrity: X and Y v The Netherlands (1986) 8 EHRR 235.  Even a \"stranger\" child, whose future is not in issue in the proceedings but whose statements are relevant, has privacy interests which deserve respect. 4. Hence, argues Mr Geekie, there should be no starting point or presumption that such cases will be rare Instead, the court should adopt the approach explained by Lord Steyn in In re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) [2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 AC 593, at para 17, when balancing of the right to respect for private and family life in article 8 and the right to freedom of expression in article 10:\"First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values of the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each.\" Mr Geekie understands that article 6 is not a qualified right in the same way that article 8 is a qualified right, but he accepts that what is entailed in a fair hearing in Childen Act proceedings will have to take account of the article 8 rights of all concerned. All he asks for is \"an intense focus\" upon their comparative importance rather than an assumption that the one will almost always trump the other. 2.",

And that's something to which we've given considerable consideration as to whether or not we should make a claim that an Article 6 right has any greater claim in a balancing exercise and after consideration. It was our decision, I hope not wrongly, but our decision that it would not be appropriate to seek to argue that the father's Article 6 right in a situation such as this had any prior claim in relation to Article 8 rights and really two reasons underlying that decision are firstly, I believe the most appropriate language is to say that although after 60 non qualified right is not an absolute right, and so if that's the law in relation to Article 6, it begins to make the position difficult to claim a prior position for Article 6. But secondly, the Article 6 rights are in these cases spread across the parties and because the child, the child witness, has her Article 6 rights and the siblings have their Article 6 rights to a fair hearing. And so in any event, there's going to be a levelling between the parties in relation to their Article 6 rights. And indeed, we've so far, I've just been addressing the situation where one has a child, witnesses who are parties. One also, of course, has to think about child witnesses who are strangers to litigation. They will have rights to engage in the litigation. Are"

The first, because one would be -- having to put it in the context of what has gone to date, the first statement would be a clear statement of an equal starting point for all competing interests. Sorry, could you say that again? An equal starting point for all competing interests and the -- of course, one can't begin to list all competing interests that might arise, but judges can be cautioned or advised to be alert to the Article 6 and 8 rights of witnesses, and in the way that My Lady, we've canvassed already, that would apply to different -- witnesses in the three different positions before the Court. The Article 6 and 8 rights of parents, and the Article 6 and 8 rights of siblings. And if one sets those as separate categories as the appropriate path to begin thinking about, that at least gives a decision-making judge in an individual case the right ambit of decisions to consider. The present authorities rely significantly upon the, as Lord Justice Wilson put it, the yardstick of oppression, we've traced through the origins of oppression as a test in issuing a witness summons, just -- I haven't gone through it in detail, but it goes back to the ITN case and Morgan v Morgan within family proceedings, and we've done that simply because, this Court may wish to consider whether or not oppression is too clumsy a test. It may be that when one is looking at the welfare of the child, things short of oppression should be taken into account. So, there is -- certainly there's no, we would submit, there's no binding authority on this Court that says oppression must stay in, and the Court may wish or need to consider whether a more flexible test in looking at the child's welfare might be appropriate."

But the our argument is in favour of a test, which says, if I can just use a shorthand at this stage or competing claims and rights must be looked at from an even starting point and trial judges, when considering any of the three positions that my lady deposits will have to look at the position of the individual child or children, which may fulfil different functions in one case and consider their position within that test. And so, if you have if you if you have a set of care proceedings where there is only one child, only one child in the family, only one child involved in any way at all who is the Who is alleging abuse? And so she is the child witness and she is the subject of the proceedings, you won't have to consider any sibling rights, and you will give an intense focus upon her Article 6 and Article 8 rights. If you have a case where the only witness to an event is child is not a party to the proceedings. The trial judge. When evaluating the evidence as to whether or not that child would have to give evidence, I would have to consider that she has a right to family life into privacy. So she has Article 8 rights and would have to evaluate those. But the trial just wouldn't have to worry about the one of the troubling aspects of these cases, of course, the future impact upon family relations if it is a subject child. And so the range of factors to be considered by the trial judge within the same test may not be so broad or troubling when one is considering a stranger child. So it's the What is different, I would submit, is the range of factors to be considered by the trial judge. Not not the overarching"

How, as you rightly put it if we're looking at Article 6, all the children, both the adults, have got Article 6 rights that are engaged in this case, so they're all entitled to a fair hearing in the determination of those rights. And the only question is what's fair If you introduce Article 8 that adds a different level of complexity, which may vary as between the strangers to the action and the parties to the action? That's the only point I'm putting to you. It's not identical to the straightforward battle between Article 8 and Article 10. That there was in that was complicated"

			"text": "those in the light of submissions that have been made. My Lord, may I make a brief comment upon just a few matters that have been raised Firstly, the discussion that has taken place in relation to the ABE interview and its status as the best evidence. I don't contend the proposition for one moment that in the case of a child who has been abused, it is likely to be the best evidence. But the difficulties we apprehend it is that it does not deal with the difficulty of testing in an account, which may not be true, so that that is the heart of the difficulty for those cases where there really is an issue as to reliability. The ABE interview, because of the careful manner in which it is, produced, may disguise rather than reveal difficulties. May I just say a word about some of the exchanges that took place in relation to what was styled very loosely. I appreciate the old Bailey cross examination, but certainly I'm sure we all understood what was intended by that loose styling in a criminal case. It may well be that there are limitations upon the degree to which a Crown Court judge can intervene the reasons for that particular to the jury trial. But in the family case, we certainly would accept that a family judge has a continuing duty to safeguard the welfare of a child who is a child witness and in those circumstances, in the way that was canvas to a degree in submissions, I think particular between myself and My Lord, Lord Kerr, it would be the duty or certainly available to him, probably the duty of the family judge, too. Be more interventionist in relation to the way in which cross examination is conducted, and certainly if one is, I appreciate My Lady has raised other matters about how these things can be done, and I'll come to that in just a moment. But if one is thinking in terms of cross examination will be through, albeit through a live link, this court could make clear we would submit that it is the duty of the judge to continue to control the process. A live point of that is the point that I made yesterday about the status of the child, who is a simple witness, what I call the stranger child. And there any Article 8 rights they have. The way in which I hope will certainly intended to put that is that it's that individual, that child before the court, has a right to respect for private life, and these processes are intrusive into private life total that extent that child has, the court has to look to that child's right. That consideration will be considerably more circumscribed when one is the subject child. But the point is that in any case of any child witness before the court, the judge would have a continuing duty and therefore would be obliged to have control over the way in which the cross examination proceeds.

The attendance of a reluctant child should not be required by virtue of a witness summons if it will be oppressive social order. We would add the rider, perhaps, that the attendance of any child should not be required if it's oppressive and the welfare of the child is irrelevant but not paramount consideration. And because one is trying to pick up what the test is from a number of authorities, one could express it slightly differently. But we accept that encapsulates the key elements of the test as they had been as it has been developed by the Court of Appeal."

Can I just consider, the issue of the welfare of the child and in the context and this feeds directly into my paragraph 47 where I say the welfare, of the child is irrelevant but not paramount consideration it links into Mr Geekie's point about whether a non subject child, so a child who is simply a witness within proceedings has Article 8 rights engaged, so not as confident as Mr Geekie on that. But what I would say is that if the court is considering a child as a witness and in no other capacity, we would say that that child's welfare is relevant and that probably actually answers the Article 8 point if that's engaged. But when we say welfare of a child is relevant, we mean for any child witness, whether a party or no. The way in which we had formulated the factors to be put into the balancing exercise came as is clear from paragraph 45 of the Medway case from the judgement of the Lady Justice Smith, where she went on to look at the various factors, she's put them in a much more generalised form. We don't have any objection to a more detailed formulation, I think you just for a moment oops, of"

The court has a responsibility to consider that child's welfare in a way that they courts often have to consider welfare for older witnesses who may be learning disabled. And it does. It does crop up in different situations, and those young people who may be over 18 but have learning difficulties equally would need careful and special consideration. And so estimate the the the child witness who is not not a party to proceedings does have Article 8 rights to privacy because of the nature of the allegations and the intrusive nature of the testing of evidence in this sort of case. But depending on the particular facts, a particular case a judge might come to a different decision if the child were a stranger child, if the child were the only subject child of those proceedings. And so when all that I would respectfully submit is consistent with an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed, that any potential witness who can articulate a claim is deserves that intense focus and and that's what should be undertaken and their status within the proceedings will be a factor and may or may not influence the decision as to whether or not they should give evidence."

In that case, they might have the child was a party. It's just a question of it needs to be looked at in the individual case."
