	"Summary": " Summary Hilary Term[2010] UKSC 12On appeal from: [2010] EWCA Civ 57 JUDGMENT W (Children)  before  Lord WalkerLady HaleLord BrownLord ManceLord Kerr JUDGMENT GIVEN ON 3 March 2010 Heard on 1st and 2nd March 2010AppellantCharles Geekie QCMichael Liebrecht(Instructed by Dutton Gregory LLP)RespondentLucinda DavisSarah Earley(Instructed by The County Council Legal Services)RespondentKate Branigan QCMaggie Jones(Instructed by Larcombes LLP) LADY HALE giving the judgment of the court 1. At issue in this case are the principles which should guide the exercise of the court's discretion in deciding whether to order a child to attend to give evidence in family proceedings. The current approach was stated by Smith LJ in LM v Medway Council, RM and YM [2007] EWCA Civ 9, [2007] 1 FLR 1698, at para 44: \"The correct starting point . . . is that it is undesirable that a child should have to give evidence in care proceedings and that particular justification will be required before that course is taken. There will be some cases in which it will be right to make an order. In my view they will be rare.\" She went on to explain the factors which should guide the judge in considering whether to make the order, at para 45: \". . . the judge will have to balance the need for the evidence in the circumstances of the case against what he assesses to be the potential for harm to the child. In assessing the need for oral evidence . . . the judge should, in my view, take account of the importance of the evidence to the process of his decision about the child's future. It may be that the child's future cannot satisfactorily be determined without that evidence. In assessing the risk of harm or oppression, the judge should take heed of current research into the effect on children of giving evidence and should not rely only upon his impression of the child, although that will of course be relevant.\" 2. That approach was based upon the earlier authority of Butler-Sloss LJ in R v B County Council, ex parte P [1991] 1 WLR 221 and Wilson J in Re P (Witness Summons) [1997] 2 FLR 447. It was endorsed by Wilson LJ in the Medway case and by Wall and Thorpe LJJ in SW v Portsmouth City Council; Re W (children: concurrent care and criminal proceedings) [2009] EWCA 644, [2009] 3 FCR 1. And it was followed by Wall and Wilson LJJ in their joint judgment in the present case: [2010] EWCA Civ 57. Each had previously stated that in all their years of experience in the Family Division of the High Court he had never heard oral evidence from a child in care proceedings. That is also my own experience. 3. The complaint, very moderately advanced by Mr Geekie QC, [HS1]is that a \"starting point\" [HS2]of undesirability, placing the burden upon the person wishing to cross-examine a child to show some \"particular justification\" for doing so, gives insufficient weight to the Convention rights of all concerned. 1 4. All the parties in care proceedings are entitled to a fair hearing in the determination of their civil rights and obligations the parents who stand to lose their children if allegations of abuse are made out, the children who stand to lose their parents if allegations of abuse are made out, but also stand to suffer abuse or further abuse if they are left at home because those allegations cannot be proved. And it is not only their article 6 rights which are in play. The civil rights in issue are also Convention rights in themselves the right to respect for the family lives of the parents and their children but also the right to respect for the private lives of the children, which include their rights to be protected from attacks upon their physical and psychological integrity: X and Y v The Netherlands (1986) 8 EHRR 235.  Even a \"stranger\" child, whose future is not in issue in the proceedings but whose statements are relevant, has privacy interests which deserve respect. 4. Hence, argues Mr Geekie, there should be no starting point or presumption that such cases will be rare Instead, the court should adopt the approach explained by Lord Steyn in In re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) [2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 AC 593, at para 17, when balancing of the right to respect for private and family life in article 8 and the right to freedom of expression in article 10:\"First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values of the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each.\" Mr Geekie understands that article 6 is not a qualified right in the same way that article 8 is a qualified right, but he accepts that what is entailed in a fair hearing in Childen Act proceedings will have to take account of the article 8 rights of all concerned. All he asks for is \"an intense focus\" upon their comparative importance rather than an assumption that the one will almost always trump the other. 2.",

The inquisitorial nature of childrens' proceedings applies in private law proceedings, as much as it does in care proceedings, there may not be authority for that proposition, but it's obviously correct. Absolutely. I don't believe it to be controversial, Mr Geekie will tell me if he thinks it is, so the judge would, or the court, would be in charge in the same way, as to what to do about a particular piece of hearsay evidence, and how to arrange for it to be challenged if the judge thought that that was necessary, in the circumstances. But in terms of, if you set, and I think we are very much in line behind the local authority in terms of favouring some clarification from this Court about the current position, those considerations will apply equally in the private law arena. And I do think we have to have strongly in mind, when there is a suggestion that there shouldn't be a starting point, and I think it really goes to that point, if you start with a blank canvas, as suggested by Mr Geekie, and you just factor in all of the issues as you go, we think there is a real risk of importing into the private law arena, a completely inappropriate involvement by the child in the evidence building process."

That's why I come back to our urgent claim that we're not seeking to make it more or less likely, that a child should give evidence. It may well be otherwise. But there is because of the sensitivity and the importance of the conflicting claims. You have to start from an even point and it's set out in our documentation. I perhaps don't need to spend too long at this stage. But just picking up my Lord, Lord Browne's points right off and 6 a little further. The the Article 6 right is an unqualified but not an absolute right. But the right when one analyse it through the convention Case law is to overall fairness in the proceedings. So the court has to stand well back and look at the overall effect within the proceedings. And it's for that reason that if one looks at the various convention cases on that subject, in some instances, hearsay evidence is admissible in some instances, not it doesn't track the Article 6 right doesn't translate into any necessary result. One has to look at the overall fairness and that's why we say that one has to measure each of these factors in an even way. And"

Argument is encapsulated in the suggestion that if a child is not called, there is a concomitant weakening of the local authority case, adopting if I may, Lord justice rhymes approach that is on reflection, a highly unsatisfactory situation. In this type of litigation, we're not engaged in straightforward, adversarial civil litigation. We were engaged, of course, with the court being charged with the decision is the welfare of the child. So if the door swings, one swing of the door is that the judge has to reject an allegation that is possibly true because she, the judge has not heard from the child. Then the system may well be failing. It's not satisfactory. A system intended to settle disputes between individuals but rather to promote the welfare of children may come back the wrong decision for lack of evidence, which could have been put before the"

We still have a situation where the the the evidence base as it is, is that the giving of evidence is harmful, and we are not in a situation, we do not have the evidence, to say it would be all right if only we adopted a special measures approach. We simply don't have that evidence, and that is something that maybe the Family Justice Council could address. So, the local authority would say that, when the authorities as they are, take as their starting point the assumption is we do not call children because it's harmful, because it's traumatic, that assumption is not an assumption plucked out of the air. It's an assumption based on the evidence as it is at the moment."

We would say it's far better, in the child's point of view, to be up front about it. We say that it isn't possible, with respect, to have a level playing field in circumstances such as this, if you've got adult competing litigants, with their different cases to run, absolutely, the same considerations apply. But when you are looking at children giving evidence, that is not, with respect, we say, the same thing at all, as an adult party giving evidence, and you have to, because of the inherent damage in it, because of that recognition, we do say that you have to put that right at the forefront with all the factors to be balanced against that in place. But we say in order to protect the child in the process, you have to have that as a starting point."

I mean, I began by saying the test have a clear statement of an equal starting point, and that's obviously a distillation from that, and then of course, insofar as any alleviation measures can be taken, they should be taken. There's no reason that -- where children do give evidence in family proceedings it is done by video link and matters of that sort. And then, of course, any test would have to set out clearly the caution which would be necessary if the hearsay evidence is received by the Court, untested by cross examination, and that is found to be expressed in the authorities but perhaps not in the way that it should be. It's most articulately expressed, most urgently expressed by Lord Justice Nichols in The Crown v B. And then, My Lady, in all that I've just said there is, we would submit, nothing, which creates a presumption in the opposite direction, but it would provide, we submit,  a clear and open way in which a judge could be assisted in coming to the right decision on what are always going to be extremely difficult"

But the our argument is in favour of a test, which says, if I can just use a shorthand at this stage or competing claims and rights must be looked at from an even starting point and trial judges, when considering any of the three positions that my lady deposits will have to look at the position of the individual child or children, which may fulfil different functions in one case and consider their position within that test. And so, if you have if you if you have a set of care proceedings where there is only one child, only one child in the family, only one child involved in any way at all who is the Who is alleging abuse? And so she is the child witness and she is the subject of the proceedings, you won't have to consider any sibling rights, and you will give an intense focus upon her Article 6 and Article 8 rights. If you have a case where the only witness to an event is child is not a party to the proceedings. The trial judge. When evaluating the evidence as to whether or not that child would have to give evidence, I would have to consider that she has a right to family life into privacy. So she has Article 8 rights and would have to evaluate those. But the trial just wouldn't have to worry about the one of the troubling aspects of these cases, of course, the future impact upon family relations if it is a subject child. And so the range of factors to be considered by the trial judge within the same test may not be so broad or troubling when one is considering a stranger child. So it's the What is different, I would submit, is the range of factors to be considered by the trial judge. Not not the overarching"

What we don't want to do in my submission is to land ourselves in a situation where this issue becomes a dominating feature of the overall case management. Our concern is that if you do not have a starting point, the court could be confronted with a very detailed inquiry simply about whether a child should give evidence and that that is not what we intend at all, but to pick up a point that Miss Davis made, it is and without making any assumptions about whether these allegations are right or not, or the propensity of that. If in fact you are a parent who has abused, it is undoubtedly in that party's interest effectively to make life as difficult as possible for the child. And we are really concerned about setting up a situation where the court has to hear detailed evidence about what the child feels about this, child thinking about it, potentially the social worker and the guardian being challenged on their analysis of whether this is going to be harmful to a child or not. I'm thinking about a sliding scale of children, whether a child of, say, the age of C is more ahead than her contemporaries and therefore more resilient. We really want to guard against that situation, and we do and I've said it several times. I'd say it for the last time. We really do believe that the court has to send the signal that the child is protected in this situation and that it is going to be, for the person seeking that child to give evidence to formulate the particular reasons, and I think that's the way it has to be. If we're going to keep this within its proper bounds,"
