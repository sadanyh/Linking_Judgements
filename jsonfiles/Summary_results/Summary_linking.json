{"Summary_linking": " Summary Hilary Term[2010] UKSC 12On appeal from: [2010] EWCA Civ 57 JUDGMENT W (Children)  before  Lord WalkerLady HaleLord BrownLord ManceLord Kerr JUDGMENT GIVEN ON 3 March 2010 Heard on 1st and 2nd March 2010AppellantCharles Geekie QCMichael Liebrecht(Instructed by Dutton Gregory LLP)RespondentLucinda DavisSarah Earley(Instructed by The County Council Legal Services)RespondentKate Branigan QCMaggie Jones(Instructed by Larcombes LLP) LADY HALE giving the judgment of the court 1. At issue in this case are the principles which should guide the exercise of the court's discretion in deciding whether to order a child to attend to give evidence in family proceedings. The current approach was stated by Smith LJ in LM v Medway Council, RM and YM [2007] EWCA Civ 9, [2007] 1 FLR 1698, at para 44: \"The correct starting point . . . is that it is undesirable that a child should have to give evidence in care proceedings and that particular justification will be required before that course is taken. There will be some cases in which it will be right to make an order. In my view they will be rare.\" She went on to explain the factors which should guide the judge in considering whether to make the order, at para 45: \". . . the judge will have to balance the need for the evidence in the circumstances of the case against what he assesses to be the potential for harm to the child. In assessing the need for oral evidence . . . the judge should, in my view, take account of the importance of the evidence to the process of his decision about the child's future. It may be that the child's future cannot satisfactorily be determined without that evidence. In assessing the risk of harm or oppression, the judge should take heed of current research into the effect on children of giving evidence and should not rely only upon his impression of the child, although that will of course be relevant.\" 2. That approach was based upon the earlier authority of Butler-Sloss LJ in R v B County Council, ex parte P [1991] 1 WLR 221 and Wilson J in Re P (Witness Summons) [1997] 2 FLR 447. It was endorsed by Wilson LJ in the Medway case and by Wall and Thorpe LJJ in SW v Portsmouth City Council; Re W (children: concurrent care and criminal proceedings) [2009] EWCA 644, [2009] 3 FCR 1. And it was followed by Wall and Wilson LJJ in their joint judgment in the present case: [2010] EWCA Civ 57. Each had previously stated that in all their years of experience in the Family Division of the High Court he had never heard oral evidence from a child in care proceedings. That is also my own experience. 3. The complaint, very moderately advanced by Mr Geekie QC, [HS1]is that a \"starting point\" [HS2]of undesirability, placing the burden upon the person wishing to cross-examine a child to show some \"particular justification\" for doing so, gives insufficient weight to the Convention rights of all concerned. 1 4. All the parties in care proceedings are entitled to a fair hearing in the determination of their civil rights and obligations the parents who stand to lose their children if allegations of abuse are made out, the children who stand to lose their parents if allegations of abuse are made out, but also stand to suffer abuse or further abuse if they are left at home because those allegations cannot be proved. And it is not only their article 6 rights which are in play. The civil rights in issue are also Convention rights in themselves the right to respect for the family lives of the parents and their children but also the right to respect for the private lives of the children, which include their rights to be protected from attacks upon their physical and psychological integrity: X and Y v The Netherlands (1986) 8 EHRR 235.  Even a \"stranger\" child, whose future is not in issue in the proceedings but whose statements are relevant, has privacy interests which deserve respect. 4. Hence, argues Mr Geekie, there should be no starting point or presumption that such cases will be rare Instead, the court should adopt the approach explained by Lord Steyn in In re S (Identification: Restrictions on Publication) [2004] UKHL 47, [2005] 1 AC 593, at para 17, when balancing of the right to respect for private and family life in article 8 and the right to freedom of expression in article 10:\"First, neither article has as such precedence over the other. Secondly, where the values of the two articles are in conflict, an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed in the individual case is necessary. Thirdly, the justifications for interfering with or restricting each right must be taken into account. Finally, the proportionality test must be applied to each.\" Mr Geekie understands that article 6 is not a qualified right in the same way that article 8 is a qualified right, but he accepts that what is entailed in a fair hearing in Childen Act proceedings will have to take account of the article 8 rights of all concerned. All he asks for is \"an intense focus\" upon their comparative importance rather than an assumption that the one will almost always trump the other. 2.", "Trancription": [{"time": "00:01:31.440,00:03:19.240,spk_2,", "text": "Looking at what we say should be the starting point. Can I just consider, the issue of the welfare of the child and in the context and this feeds directly into my paragraph 47 where I say the welfare, of the child is irrelevant but not paramount consideration it links into Mr Geekie's point about whether a non subject child, so a child who is simply a witness within proceedings has Article 8 rights engaged, so not as confident as Mr Geekie on that. But what I would say is that if the court is considering a child as a witness and in no other capacity, we would say that that child's welfare is relevant and that probably actually answers the Article 8 point if that's engaged. But when we say welfare of a child is relevant, we mean for any child witness, whether a party or no. The way in which we had formulated the factors to be put into the balancing exercise came as is clear from paragraph 45 of the Medway case from the judgement of the Lady Justice Smith, where she went on to look at the various factors, she's put them in a much more generalised form.

It links into a practical concern I have, And so perhaps it's worth dealing with at this stage. What we don't want to do in my submission is to land ourselves in a situation where this issue becomes a dominating feature of the overall case management. Our concern is that if you do not have a starting point, the court could be confronted with a very detailed inquiry simply about whether a child should give evidence and that that is not what we intend at all, but to pick up a point that Miss Davis made, it is and without making any assumptions about whether these allegations are right or not, or the propensity of that. If in fact you are a parent who has abused, it is undoubtedly in that party's interest effectively to make life as difficult as possible for the child. And we are really concerned about setting up a situation where the court has to hear detailed evidence about what the child feels about this, child thinking about it, potentially the social worker and the guardian being challenged on their analysis of whether this is going to be harmful to a child or not. I'm thinking about a sliding scale of children, whether a child of, say, the age of C is more ahead than her contemporaries and therefore more resilient. We really want to guard against that situation, and we do and I've said it several times. I'd say it for the last time. We really do believe that the court has to send the signal that the child is protected in this situation and that it is going to be, for the person seeking that child to give evidence to formulate the particular reasons, and I think that's the way it has to be.

Conflicted cross examination about the details of the event itself may be very unproductive. It may have a different impact on in front of a jury, I don't know. But many take the view that to examine surrounding detail to examine points which can reveal whether the child is reliable or not and can reveal context and background can be more productive. And the point about that cross examination is it's less likely to be traumatising for the child. It's not one of the key concerns, of course. This is asking the child have to relive the event, and that is a supremely sensitive arena. Other questions which can be revealing, can be illuminating, for the tribunal can be in relation to aspects which are less difficult for the child. And so I simply invite the court not to approach on the basis of it has to be a you did. You didn't in relation to the the events themselves, but there can be much more that can be revealed and of assistance to the tribunal of fact. Well, My Lady, turning to the alternative proposals about other means in which this might be done. I've made submission already in relation to what we say about the standing or position of the work to be done by the family justice counsel in relation to this hearing. I don't propose to go over that submission again. The court has our position on that. Of course, I would accept that the Family Justice Council will be able to not only provide a depth and breadth of evidence, but also they will be able to advise on policy and practice. And all of that might inform future practice. What has been in a sense canvas before this court in the course of yesterday afternoon and today is the possibility of some form of Section 28 of the Youth Justice Act, which has not been brought in crime of the prerecorded cross examination being deployed within family proceedings. My Lord, I simply say in relation to that that that does seem to us with respect to involve such broad issues of policy and practice that although it might be something upon which this court could pass comment as to, the virtue of further investigation, as did indoor indeed did. Lord Justice Wall in S and W and W. We would respectfully suggest it would be. It's difficult to see how it could be a direct outcome of a hearing such of this, which is concentrating upon a specific legal test. May I just touch briefly on three or a couple of final short subjects? The question has arisen about the father's position in relation to any further application arising out of the interview. The Child on the 13th of January, 13th of January. My Lord, it's been quite impossible to contemplate putting that issue before Judge Marshall, because at all stages since the 13th of January, the question is to the appropriate test that Judge Marshall should have to apply if she had to reconsider. The matter has been under judicial scrutiny, as at the 13th of January, the Court of Appeal decision was pending that was promulgated, I believe on the ninth of February, and within days of that, this court has granted permission for the matter to come back to this court. So it's been quite impossible to invite Judge Marshall to reconsider that issue without her having available to her the test that she should apply."}, {"time": "00:22:40.710,00:24:57.600,spk_1,", "text": "My Lady, Mr Liebrecht and I have done a lot of thinking about it, and I didn't want to be presumptuous in any dictation, but I can certainly tell Your Ladyship how -- the factors that we would see comprising the appropriate test. The first, because one would be -- having to put it in the context of what has gone to date, the first statement would be a clear statement of an equal starting point for all competing interests. Sorry, could you say that again? An equal starting point for all competing interests and the -- of course, one can't begin to list all competing interests that might arise, but judges can be cautioned or advised to be alert to the Article 6 and 8 rights of witnesses, and in the way that My Lady, we've canvassed already, that would apply to different -- witnesses in the three different positions before the Court. The Article 6 and 8 rights of parents, and the Article 6 and 8 rights of siblings. And if one sets those as separate categories as the appropriate path to begin thinking about, that at least gives a decision-making judge in an individual case the right ambit of decisions to consider. The present authorities rely significantly upon the, as Lord Justice Wilson put it, the yardstick of oppression, we've traced through the origins of oppression as a test in issuing a witness summons, just -- I haven't gone through it in detail, but it goes back to the ITN case and Morgan v Morgan within family proceedings, and we've done that simply because, this Court may wish to consider whether or not oppression is too clumsy a test. It may be that when one is looking at the welfare of the child, things short of oppression should be taken into account. So, there is -- certainly there's no, we would submit, there's no binding authority on this Court that says oppression must stay in, and the Court may wish or need to consider whether a more flexible test in looking at the child's welfare might be appropriate."}, {"time": "00:37:15.840,00:39:35.260,spk_3,", "text": "I believe we have a firm answer to that, so I hope it's a satisfactory one. The position your ladyship postulates, applies already in relation to a child and criminal proceedings that that if the child is asking all the investigator feels obliged to explain, then the child would have to be told you'll probably have to give oral evidence at a criminal trial. If this gives rise to an allegation of crime, you're likely to have to give evidence. And indeed, the very ABE interview in this case starts off as early on in it, a discussion with a child about the fact that you may have to give evidence in a court. So insofar as there is that concern as to the impact upon children, generally, it's within the system, and it's difficult to see why an investigator or social worker would be able to put on the child's behalf, filter out what you might have to do with in criminal proceedings of what you might have to do with in family proceedings. But secondly, perhaps more importantly, we resist very firmly any suggestion that the anyway behind our underlying disappear. All these submissions is a suggestion that children should have to give evidence in criminal proceedings more often. And the local authority directly say in their case, Statement of Case, that if this appeal is correct, then it will lead to a presumption that a child should have to give evidence. And we with great respect say absolutely not. All we are saying, is that when considering this issue, all competing interests should be evaluated from a level starting point because the competing interests are separately so important that it's wrong to rank them prior to consideration. And it's not convention compliant, We will say anyway will develop in a moment, and so you start from a level basis, and that does not lead to conclusion that there'll be a presumption that a child should give evidence what a court will do, what the individual judge will do in the individual"}, {"time": "00:48:44.650,00:51:52.300,spk_4,", "text": "those in the light of submissions that have been made. My Lord, may I make a brief comment upon just a few matters that have been raised Firstly, the discussion that has taken place in relation to the ABE interview and its status as the best evidence. I don't contend the proposition for one moment that in the case of a child who has been abused, it is likely to be the best evidence. But the difficulties we apprehend it is that it does not deal with the difficulty of testing in an account, which may not be true, so that that is the heart of the difficulty for those cases where there really is an issue as to reliability. The ABE interview, because of the careful manner in which it is, produced, may disguise rather than reveal difficulties. May I just say a word about some of the exchanges that took place in relation to what was styled very loosely. I appreciate the old Bailey cross examination, but certainly I'm sure we all understood what was intended by that loose styling in a criminal case. It may well be that there are limitations upon the degree to which a Crown Court judge can intervene the reasons for that particular to the jury trial. But in the family case, we certainly would accept that a family judge has a continuing duty to safeguard the welfare of a child who is a child witness and in those circumstances, in the way that was canvas to a degree in submissions, I think particular between myself and My Lord, Lord Kerr, it would be the duty or certainly available to him, probably the duty of the family judge, too. Be more interventionist in relation to the way in which cross examination is conducted, and certainly if one is, I appreciate My Lady has raised other matters about how these things can be done, and I'll come to that in just a moment. But if one is thinking in terms of cross examination will be through, albeit through a live link, this court could make clear we would submit that it is the duty of the judge to continue to control the process. A live point of that is the point that I made yesterday about the status of the child, who is a simple witness, what I call the stranger child. And there any Article 8 rights they have. The way in which I hope will certainly intended to put that is that it's that individual, that child before the court, has a right to respect for private life, and these processes are intrusive into private life total that extent that child has, the court has to look to that child's right. That consideration will be considerably more circumscribed when one is the subject child. But the point is that in any case of any child witness before the court, the judge would have a continuing duty and therefore would be obliged to have control over the way in which the cross examination proceeds.

And in the written documentation in the Bundles, we've produced the case of Re(H), Re(K), which was the decision of the Court of Appeal in relation to, statutory proceedings, private law proceedings as the children. And that judgment made clear that, as I say chronologically in the lead up to the Children Act 1989 the courts decided that hearsay was not admissible in children proceedings. A parallel and similar decision was made in the Bradford case, in relation to proceedings in the juvenile court, the venue for care proceedings prior to implementation of the Children Act. And My Lord, I don't at this stage proposed necessary to go to those two cases. There's nothing that I seek to derived from them in particular, other than just setting us in the historical context of, here say not being admissible other than in wardship As we move towards the Act of 1989. What is of interest we submit is that those two cases H and K in particular led directly to a late amendment to the Children's Bill, adding Section 96 as we now see it, and it might give assistance.

And so, if you have if you if you have a set of care proceedings where there is only one child, only one child in the family, only one child involved in any way at all who is the Who is alleging abuse? And so she is the child witness and she is the subject of the proceedings, you won't have to consider any sibling rights, and you will give an intense focus upon her Article 6 and Article 8 rights. If you have a case where the only witness to an event is child is not a party to the proceedings. The trial judge. When evaluating the evidence as to whether or not that child would have to give evidence, I would have to consider that she has a right to family life into privacy. So she has Article 8 rights and would have to evaluate those. But the trial just wouldn't have to worry about the one of the troubling aspects of these cases, of course, the future impact upon family relations if it is a subject child. And so the range of factors to be considered by the trial judge within the same test may not be so broad or troubling when one is considering a stranger child.

It has to be quantum leaps different for a child to be doing it via video link than confronting counselling court. And so I think that's where the practitioners come from, special measures has been a good introduction, has moved things forward. The reason I say that measuring up makes interesting reading, is because it comes from a different perspective. The practitioner's perspective is one thing, the perspective of the child going through the process is a completely different thing. And I'm going to take Your Lordships shortly to two or three passages which, we say, are worthy of particular note within measuring up, because, from my perspective reading that document, the perceptions of children are clearly different from where I would say that practitioners' are. The other specific reason why I think this overall issue has become increasingly troubling, is because of the huge increase in fact finding hearings. When the 89' Act came into force, I struggled to recollect any significant hearing where we spent a lot of time looking at the factual substrata. Now that may have been a wrong approach, but that was the way it was, and much more of the hearing was concentrated on welfare and the future of the child. I think rightly, we've come to recognise how important the factual substrata is, to the future decisions for the children. But that increase, in fact finding hearings, I think, has shed a spotlight onto this particular issue, and we would be saying to the Court, that it's important to look at this issue not just in the context of Section 31 but in the much broader context of family proceedings generally. And our overall submission is that, in fact, the issues that this Court is being asked to consider, and indeed the terms of reference of the Family Justice Council, actually throw up far more difficult issues in the private law arena, than they do in the public law arena, and I shall develop that shortly to explain why I say that.

But there is because of the sensitivity and the importance of the conflicting claims. You have to start from an even point and it's set out in our documentation. I perhaps don't need to spend too long at this stage. But just picking up my Lord, Lord Browne's points right off and 6 a little further. The the Article 6 right is an unqualified but not an absolute right. But the right when one analyse it through the convention Case law is to overall fairness in the proceedings. So the court has to stand well back and look at the overall effect within the proceedings. And it's for that reason that if one looks at the various convention cases on that subject, in some instances, hearsay evidence is admissible in some instances, not it doesn't track the Article 6 right doesn't translate into any necessary result.

But secondly, the Article 6 rights are in these cases spread across the parties and because the child, the child witness, has her Article 6 rights and the siblings have their Article 6 rights to a fair hearing. And so in any event, there's going to be a levelling between the parties in relation to their Article 6 rights.

The inquisitorial nature of childrens' proceedings applies in private law proceedings, as much as it does in care proceedings, there may not be authority for that proposition, but it's obviously correct. Absolutely. I don't believe it to be controversial, Mr Geekie will tell me if he thinks it is, so the judge would, or the court, would be in charge in the same way, as to what to do about a particular piece of hearsay evidence, and how to arrange for it to be challenged if the judge thought that that was necessary, in the circumstances. But in terms of, if you set, and I think we are very much in line behind the local authority in terms of favouring some clarification from this Court about the current position, those considerations will apply equally in the private law arena. And I do think we have to have strongly in mind, when there is a suggestion that there shouldn't be a starting point, and I think it really goes to that point, if you start with a blank canvas, as suggested by Mr Geekie, and you just factor in all of the issues as you go, we think there is a real risk of importing into the private law arena, a completely inappropriate involvement by the child in the evidence building process."}, {"time": "00:57:40.280,00:59:26.160,spk_3,", "text": "Yes, it it may be, but when one is considering a child, you have to.

We also received evidence and police officers and social workers that many hundreds of cases cannot be pursued successfully each year because children seem unlikely to make effective or legally competent witnesses under under present circumstances.

But we accept that encapsulates the key elements of the test as they had been as it has been developed by the Court of Appeal."}, {"time": "00:29:33.990,00:31:05.190,spk_1,", "text": "Yes, yes, it's all within that framework, precisely. I mean, I began by saying the test have a clear statement of an equal starting point, and that's obviously a distillation from that, and then of course, insofar as any alleviation measures can be taken, they should be taken. There's no reason that -- where children do give evidence in family proceedings it is done by video link and matters of that sort. And then, of course, any test would have to set out clearly the caution which would be necessary if the hearsay evidence is received by the Court, untested by cross examination, and that is found to be expressed in the authorities but perhaps not in the way that it should be. It's most articulately expressed, most urgently expressed by Lord Justice Nichols in The Crown v B. And then, My Lady, in all that I've just said there is, we would submit, nothing, which creates a presumption in the opposite direction, but it would provide, we submit,  a clear and open way in which a judge could be assisted in coming to the right decision on what are always going to be extremely difficult"}, {"time": "01:33:07.100,01:34:29.810,spk_0,", "text": "we looking, when it is said, inevitably in that exercise the damage to the child of giving evidence is going to be an important weight in the balance, are we not there making a distinction without a difference? We would say it's far better, in the child's point of view, to be up front about it. We say that it isn't possible, with respect, to have a level playing field in circumstances such as this, if you've got adult competing litigants, with their different cases to run, absolutely, the same considerations apply. But when you are looking at children giving evidence, that is not, with respect, we say, the same thing at all, as an adult party giving evidence, and you have to, because of the inherent damage in it, because of that recognition, we do say that you have to put that right at the forefront with all the factors to be balanced against that in place. But we say in order to protect the child in the process, you have to have that as a starting point."}, {"time": "01:13:18.400,01:14:33.510,spk_3,", "text": "Lord Justice Wall 68. So that's the Paragraph. Paragraph 68. Lord Justice Wall sets out Lengthy citation from the decision of Donald Judd Marston, where the judge, the trial judge, refused to permit the child to give evidence. And Lord Justice Rimer had seized on the words which come five or six lines before the break in. That citation has presented on this page he sees that that is, the father says, is grossly unfair. The reality is the position which pertains in 99 out of 100 of these sorts of cases. It is only in very unusual case that a complainant, if I can use that word from criminal law, will give evidence the child would give evidence, the child will give evidence and then goes on to the door swinging analogy, which again is something I'll come to a little later now, as Lord Justice Rimer says in the Court of Appeal's judgment. In this case, that's obviously not a scientific test, but but taken together with the other matters to which I can take the court, it does give some indication of how this test is working out and practise. A further indication can be found from Her Honour Judge Marshall's decision..."}]}
