p1,00:00:33.940,00:00:44.250,spk_1,Bringing the appeal I (a child) --
p1,00:00:46.640,00:01:22.190,spk_2,"Before we begin, can I just say two things? First of all, about timing. You may have had the impression that we were going to sit at 2.15 after the short adjournment. I don't know whether that's right, but we proposed to sit at two o'clock as usual and rise again at four. The other thing is that I understand that some names have appeared when they shouldn't have done on websites and so on, just to be perfectly clear an anonymity order is to be made today to make it plain that the details of parties names are not to be released. I hope there's no objection to that. We simply proposed to make the order."
p1,00:01:22.230,00:01:23.480,spk_0,There is no objection My Lord.
p1,00:01:23.480,00:01:24.610,spk_2,Thank you very much.
p1,00:01:24.610,00:01:33.050,spk_0,"Thank you very much. My Lord, may I introduce to representatives? Yes. I appear on behalf of the appellant mother, together with My learned friend Mr Edward Devereux who sits immediately to my left."
p1,00:01:34.140,00:01:34.440,spk_2,The
p1,00:01:34.450,00:02:05.760,spk_0,"father is represented by my learned friends Miss Alison Russell QC and Miss Divya Nichols. The children, the child who appears via children's guardian, is represented by my learned friend Miss Charlton, who sits to my far right and the intervener given permission to intervene in this appeal by your Lordships by the court last week is represented by my learned friends Mr Henry Setright QC  and Mr Teertha Gupta."
p1,00:02:07.040,00:02:23.100,spk_2,"We were proposing to hear the intervener after everybody else has spoken, is that convenient? I think unless anybody objects, it seemed to us we'd rather have all the arguments deployed because the intervener is taking a neutral position as we understand and"
p1,00:02:23.110,00:02:23.900,spk_0,I think
p1,00:02:23.900,00:02:31.750,spk_2,"it might make more sense for us to be able to put questions to the intervener once we've heard both sides of the argument. But if anybody objects, please say so."
p1,00:02:31.760,00:02:33.570,spk_1,"No, there is no objection. Thank you."
p1,00:02:33.580,00:02:34.060,spk_2,Thank you.
p1,00:02:35.840,00:03:58.090,spk_0,"The court will be aware that this is an appeal against an order of the Court of Appeal dated the 21st of July. Dismissing an appeal against the decision of his honour Judge Barlett, sitting as a judge of the family division whereby he held the court did not have jurisdiction to entertain applications under the Children Act for orders assessing and defining contact between our client, the mother and the parties' only child, Q, who is now aged nine years of age. Permission was granted -- it was refused to appear, permission to appear was refused by the Court of Appeal but granted by this court, I think on the 28th of September. Could I just my Lord mention one or two preliminary matters? First of all, we are extremely grateful to the court for accommodating this case, this appeal so quickly. Of course, as a children's case, it is a matter of some urgency. I hope the Lord will permit me just in particular, thank the court staff particularly I name Mrs Demanbro for the assistance that they particularly she have given us over the last few weeks in the unusual circumstances in which we found ourselves. And it's a credit to the court that they were able to provide that assistance despite or the other demand on their time in"
p1,00:03:58.090,00:04:07.160,spk_2,"the last few weeks. I think it's a mutual process. I think we're very pleased by the way parties have brought the case before us, and the case has been nicely presented. So we're very grateful."
p1,00:04:07.840,00:04:12.270,spk_1,"I'm sure we will pass on your kind words to Mrs Demanbro, who seems to have left us."
p1,00:04:14.640,00:04:14.870,spk_2,She
p1,00:04:14.870,00:04:58.850,spk_0,"was here a moment ago. She's behind you. Unfortunately, inevitably, my lord, there are, as a consequence of the speed there are one or two errors and omissions. Perhaps the most important, although it's not that important, is that I noticed last night that an out of date version, Your Lordships may have spotted it, an out of date version of the Family Law Act 1986 is included in the papers at Tab 10 and I'm going to ask your usher if you could just distribute -- have they been distributed? The document you have there, that's the up to date version, and in particular you will see, that on page two"
p1,00:04:59.340,00:04:59.580,spk_2,the
p1,00:04:59.580,00:05:59.690,spk_0,"jurisdiction, Section 2 at the bottom is in the current form, and I am sorry my Lord, about that. The intervener was given permission to intervene last week, and their case was produced to us last night. I understand to the court this morning. I should perhaps just mentioned if I may my Lord, not for the for the benefit of the court but for those in court, you may be puzzled by our attire that we are not wearing robes, not, that has nothing to do with the speed with which this case has been listed. But because or may I say, for the record, that we are appearing without robes with the court's permission for reasons that I could elaborate upon if required, just to say that it seemed to be having visited the court 10 days ago, that this would be more comfortable and appropriate. So we are trying it out with Your Lordship, with the court's permission."
p1,00:05:59.700,00:06:06.050,spk_2,We are definitely content and the nature of the proceedings lends to this form of dress.
p1,00:06:06.050,00:07:34.810,spk_0,"There's some, of course, controversy at the bar about this generally. I'm not setting any precedent by addressing the court in this fashion. Could I just I'm sure the papers are in order, broadly speaking, say, for one or two errors. But could I just establish the court should have, first of all, a core volume which comprises particular case the respondent's case, you know, it's for people, etcetera. The papers are in a pastoral blue colour, and the authorities, in a pastoral green colour the appendix is divided into two where the key documents of the papers in the case of part one, other documents part two and the authorities are in three volumes tabbed, continuing through from, in our in our copies from 1 to 49. 48. And I understand that the interveners documents, which I haven't myself seen, follow on 49 onwards, is that right? I was proposing my Lord briefly to outline the facts of this case, not going much beyond what set out in the statement of facts, which appears at tab, the second tab in the core binder. But would that be of assistance to the court?"
p1,00:07:36.640,00:07:45.380,spk_2,I think it's important to identify the date at which proceedings are said to have begun proceedings in which we're involved. Perhaps you could do that for us?
p1,00:07:45.460,00:07:49.680,spk_0,"My Lord, as we go through I'll see if I can identify that date for the court."
p1,00:07:49.770,00:07:52.410,spk_1,Doesn't seem to me to be entirely straightforward.
p1,00:07:52.420,00:08:25.390,spk_0,"No. Yeah, well, perhaps we can reach a decision about that as we go through my Lady. The mother is 40 years old, originates from India, is a British citizen. The father is a little younger, originates from Pakistan, but also British citizenship. And the parties were married in 1999. Q, the only child of the party was born on the 27th of July 2000, therefore nine years old and is a British citizen. The parties separated in 2002 and subsequently divorced. Both parties have now remarried."
p1,00:08:28.040,00:08:28.180,spk_2,The
p1,00:08:28.180,00:09:23.270,spk_0,"matter concerning Q first came before the court in care proceedings in 2001 after he was found to sustain a number of fractures. And those proceedings took an unusual course, but I don't propose to dwell on them at any at any length. District Judge Brass, as he then was, after a contested hearing, found that the injuries were non accidental and that they have inflicted by the father. That's a judgement which we haven't got the tab numbers. I'm sorry to say, my Lord, so I'll give you some of these as we go through that appendix part two tab 21, 29th of May. But seven months later, at another hearing, after hearing further evidence, the District Judge reversed that finding and held that the mother, not the father, had been responsible for causing those injuries that appendix part 2 tab 22. Now the mother continues to deny --"
p1,00:09:23.270,00:09:24.350,spk_1,What is his jurisdiction to do that?
p1,00:09:25.240,00:09:27.160,spk_0,Is the jurisdiction do that -- what is the justice to do that?
p1,00:09:30.240,00:09:31.650,spk_1,Side issue.
p1,00:09:32.240,00:09:49.210,spk_0,"The answer, My Lady, is it is always I would venture to suggest is always open to a court in the exercise of their discretion in care proceedings to review findings of fact. It was -- well, that was, I can say the subject of an appeal, as you see."
p1,00:09:49.220,00:09:49.750,spk_2,Yes.
p1,00:09:49.940,00:10:08.770,spk_1,"My Lady, there was more evidence before the court. Of course. Of course. I'm assuming that district Judge Brass did not capriciously change his mind. Of course not. But that still doesn't answer the question. The normal route where it would be an appeal, permission to adduce fresh evidence, and an order for a retrial."
p1,00:10:08.780,00:10:09.210,spk_0,"I agree, My Lady."
p1,00:10:09.620,00:10:13.700,spk_1,That would be the normal route for doing it. And I merely ask why on earth it was done this way?
p1,00:10:13.700,00:10:26.140,spk_0,"I don't know. I was instructed at that stage. It has been, It has been a matter of a further appeal to the Court of Appeal. But in the event those findings still stand. And that is a factual basis. Of course, that colours everything happened since."
p1,00:10:26.740,00:10:29.070,spk_3,When were the divorce proceedings completed?
p1,00:10:29.220,00:10:31.450,spk_0,"2002 -- ah, completed?"
p1,00:10:32.240,00:10:34.160,spk_2,"Um, I don't have a date for that."
p1,00:10:34.940,00:10:35.970,spk_0,We'll check that.
p1,00:10:36.060,00:10:38.720,spk_2,"Separation, you said 2002?"
p1,00:10:38.730,00:10:51.260,spk_0,"2002. Not sure we've got the decree absolute. In 2003, my Lord, but I will find the precise date after the short adjournment. I'm sorry."
p1,00:10:52.180,00:10:52.860,spk_2,
p1,00:10:54.040,00:11:17.270,spk_0,"So, having made those further findings in December 2002, the care proceedings proceeded to a welfare hearing, as it's known, and the final hearing, that second stage of care proceedings took place on the 22nd of May. And on that occasion, the judge made a residence order in favour of the father."
p1,00:11:17.360,00:11:18.830,spk_2,We're in 2003 now?
p1,00:11:18.840,00:11:36.040,spk_0,"Yes, May 2003. In my statement of facts on page two, paragraph three. He made a residence order in favour of the father, a supervision order in favour of the local authority for 12 months and a contact order in favour of the mother."
p1,00:11:37.340,00:11:40.250,spk_2,Is this a Section 8 application at this stage?
p1,00:11:40.940,00:11:46.900,spk_0,At that stage? No. At this stage? Yes. Now it is.
p1,00:11:46.910,00:11:58.640,spk_1,"At that stage, it would be the orders resolving the care proceedings. The care proceedings come to an end, but they can be resolved by making residents orders and contact orders."
p1,00:12:00.140,00:12:04.060,spk_0,"Court has the power to make any Section 8 order in any family procedures, including care proceedings --"
p1,00:12:04.060,00:12:05.980,spk_2,"When does the father, then, apply for permission?"
p1,00:12:06.130,00:12:08.000,spk_0,He did. He then applied for --
p1,00:12:08.230,00:12:09.500,spk_2,That's not Section 8 either.
p1,00:12:12.640,00:12:13.700,spk_1,
p1,00:12:13.710,00:12:14.090,spk_0,
p1,00:12:14.100,00:12:18.550,spk_1,"[Laughs]. That's a Section 13, but it's a contentious matter."
p1,00:12:19.140,00:12:25.700,spk_3,"On your case, this is an article 12(3) cases not an article 12 (1) case."
p1,00:12:25.700,00:12:27.000,spk_0,Right.
p1,00:12:27.000,00:12:32.260,spk_3,"On your case, when did the article 12 (3) proceedings begin?"
p1,00:12:33.640,00:12:41.260,spk_0,"Well, My Lord, they began the first Art --"
p1,00:12:45.740,00:12:46.440,spk_3,"well, they"
p1,00:12:46.440,00:12:51.360,spk_0,can't have begun by definition before Brussels II revised came into force.
p1,00:12:51.940,00:12:52.560,spk_3,And when was that?
p1,00:12:53.440,00:13:03.620,spk_0,2005. [Crosstalk] 1st March 2005. Can I --
p1,00:13:03.630,00:13:08.110,spk_1,What's the date of the father's application for permission to remove the Section 13?
p1,00:13:08.110,00:13:24.910,spk_0,"It was a date of early 2004. In the mid 2004. I'll check that, and it came -- I think it was four months after, six months after or so --"
p1,00:13:25.950,00:13:28.930,spk_2,"The order was made in September 2004, wasn't it?"
p1,00:13:28.930,00:13:57.750,spk_0,"So it was -- I will check that. At that stage, of course, process to revise not yet in force. And the order made by Mr Justice Headley is at Tab 25 in Appendix 2. And if I may know -- if I may I turn to that in Appendix 2."
p1,00:13:58.740,00:13:59.060,spk_1,
p1,00:14:02.040,00:14:06.750,spk_2,"Yes, I see. Leave to remove the child from United Kingdom permanently."
p1,00:14:07.440,00:14:48.780,spk_0,"Yeah. And the order. The order to note about contact is in the interim, before the child being removed weekly, supervised visiting contact and telephone contact. And such further other supervised visits may be agreed between the parties. Now the child went to Pakistan and to anticipate an issue which is raised on the"
p1,00:14:48.790,00:14:49.540,spk_2,papers
p1,00:14:50.040,00:15:16.460,spk_0,"in circumstances, I'll come on to the moment. It's the agreed position of the parties, namely the parents and the guardian that Q is now habitually resident in Pakistan. Whichever test"
p1,00:15:16.840,00:15:17.260,spk_1,
p1,00:15:17.940,00:16:35.560,spk_0,"is applied here. [Pause]. Since that date, he has lived in Pakistan, living with extended family, going to school in Pakistan. He has returned to this country on a number of occasions for contact with his mother. She's had some contact in Pakistan as well. But his home is in Pakistan. Now, the first application, and I'm now coming, I think, to the point raised by Lord Clarke. The first application made by the mother after that was on the 31st of October 2007. She was then acting in person, and it's right that the, that point should be borne in mind, as was the father at that stage and the order, the application that she made is, as one would expect of a litigant in person, I hope you forgive me, I don't intend to demean her by that phrase, it is not, perhaps in the couch from the terms which we would expect if a lawyer were involved. So if you look at in this appendix, part two Tab 27 you see the application that she made."
p1,00:16:45.740,00:16:46.000,spk_3,Is
p1,00:16:46.000,00:16:50.960,spk_2,the case number in that the number of existing proceedings or is it a new number?
p1,00:16:52.240,00:17:27.600,spk_0,"That's -- what Your Lordship will see, that it's that I think that it's FD07, which would be a new number. It looks as though FD04 has been crossed out which I apprehend was the number of the previous application for permission to remove. It was? So she looks as though she filed it as a continue -- she filed it with the number purporting to be a continuation of existing proceedings that someone either she on advice or the courts changed the number."
p1,00:17:27.610,00:17:28.740,spk_2,What's the proper practise?
p1,00:17:29.140,00:17:59.260,spk_0,"Well, the view eventually reached by Judge Barnett and which we accept is right -- accept as right, is that there was no continuing order for contact after the 2004 proceedings came to an end and that the proper the proper course was a fresh application. So in answer to my Lord Clarke question,"
p1,00:17:59.950,00:18:00.100,spk_3,the
p1,00:18:00.100,00:18:12.360,spk_0,"first application for a Section 8 order which comes within the ambit, of course I'm looking retrospectively now comes in the ambit of Brussels II revised is this application."
p1,00:18:13.730,00:18:15.440,spk_2,And this is a section eight application?
p1,00:18:15.730,00:18:36.380,spk_0,"It is, though, as I said, it's couched in terms, which are that of a litigant in person, not those used by, those are not terms that a lawyer would use. And the matter in paragraph four of the statement of facts we set out in summary what happened thereafter."
p1,00:18:36.390,00:18:37.860,spk_3,And who are the parties to it?
p1,00:18:38.370,00:18:41.360,spk_0,The parties to it are the mother and father.
p1,00:18:41.940,00:18:42.870,spk_3,Not the child?
p1,00:18:42.920,00:19:13.350,spk_0,"Not at that stage, as my Lord may recall in private law proceedings, private children's law proceeding a child is not automatically a party. They are not so called specified proceedings under the Children Act in which a child is automatically a party. But there is a power in the court to make the child of party and appoint a guardian to represent the child. It is a discretionary power to do that."
p1,00:19:13.350,00:19:14.700,spk_2,Is that in the act?
p1,00:19:14.760,00:19:15.410,spk_0,Yes.
p1,00:19:15.420,00:19:17.160,spk_2,You have the section number to mind?
p1,00:19:18.040,00:19:24.000,spk_0,"I don't. Off the top of my head, 41 is the Section which specifies the proceedings."
p1,00:19:24.000,00:19:24.550,spk_1,I know.
p1,00:19:25.040,00:19:25.850,spk_0,Section 9.
p1,00:19:26.740,00:19:27.080,spk_1,
p1,00:19:27.770,00:19:41.620,spk_0,"We'll check that. So the -- we'll see the child is joined later on in the story. The matter comes first before the court, the 20 --"
p1,00:19:41.620,00:20:03.140,spk_3,"So the answer to my question on your case, when you say that these proceedings were first commenced, the relevant proceedings were commenced in 07, the one we were just looking at 27. And on your case, when was the court first -- when was the court seized first, for the purposes of article 12 (3)?"
p1,00:20:03.150,00:20:06.750,spk_0,The court was first seized when [crosstalk]
p1,00:20:09.240,00:20:10.200,spk_2,
p1,00:20:10.940,00:20:15.260,spk_0,[pause] on the issue of in an English jurisdiction when those proceedings are issued.
p1,00:20:15.640,00:20:26.800,spk_3,"So on your case, then under article 12 (3), when do you say the court was first seized? I appreciate this may be an issue about whether it is the first seizure. That's the expression."
p1,00:20:29.280,00:20:31.450,spk_2,31st of October.
p1,00:20:31.450,00:20:32.940,spk_1,You would say the 31st of October?
p1,00:20:32.940,00:20:33.640,spk_0,2007.
p1,00:20:36.640,00:20:40.560,spk_3,And the child was not a party to those proceedings at that moment?
p1,00:20:42.840,00:21:28.360,spk_0,"That's right. Briefly, the hearings that took place, there was a hearing on the 5th of November. Both parties attended at matter adjourned. And then, on the 12th of December, 2007, both parties attended again in person for a conciliation hearing at which, after which the Deputy District Judge Crowther made an order. And that is at 30 in the same appendix two. So this is an agreed order as to contact and you, the court will see sets out in some detail"
p1,00:21:29.340,00:21:29.670,spk_1,
p1,00:21:30.640,00:21:35.050,spk_0,what is to happen [crosstalk].
p1,00:21:37.440,00:21:40.020,spk_2,
p1,00:21:40.020,00:22:11.800,spk_0,"I think it is actually -- it says as amended and attached hereto. I would expect that there will be another page somewhere. But at any rate, the basis of the group of the order agreed is set out in the body on that page."
p1,00:22:11.810,00:22:13.280,spk_3,So there should be another document?
p1,00:22:13.280,00:22:22.400,spk_0,"I think there is. I think there is another document. We'll check, we'll check. But the substance of the order is as set out at the bottom of that page."
p1,00:22:22.400,00:22:24.110,spk_3,And this is an agreement between the parents?
p1,00:22:24.180,00:22:26.150,spk_0,It is. And the body of the court order.
p1,00:22:26.150,00:22:27.800,spk_3,No agreement on behalf of the child?
p1,00:22:28.740,00:22:29.960,spk_0,No. Child not a party at that point.
p1,00:22:32.840,00:22:44.500,spk_1,We should make it clear that it's extremely unusual for children to be separately represented in section 8 proceedings. So there's nothing unusual about doing things in this way.

p1,00:27:26.440,00:27:32.170,spk_1,Bearing in mind the technicalities we're involved in in these proceedings.
p1,00:27:34.820,00:33:51.980,spk_0,"And then the order, to just go on to the order. The order requires the father to bring the child to the jurisdiction. For contact, the following year, this June, June for 8 weeks, June, July 2009 and provides the mother to have reasonable contact with the child either as agreed or as ordered by the court with reasonable telephone contact with a child in Pakistan and the mother is at liberty to visiting and contact the child in Pakistan. The father, having assured the court that she will be safe with his family and the judgement hopefully, in my hope, is immediately behind that, my tab eight in appendix part one. I don't know what tab number it is in court bundle. The next document is that Mr Justice Headley's judgment. Now, much of this judgment is deals with issues that arose because the judge was here in person and again, I don't propose to go through it in full unless the court wishes me to do so. But he recites the history, some of the evidence he'd heard he got the -- he asked the senior CAFCASS officer in the High Court Mr Miller, to attend to help see the parties and discuss matters. He recites what Mr Miller said to him. Paragraph 17 in the judgment and then paragraph 19 he says, I have no doubt that the court ought to give further consideration as to how this case is to be managed in the long term. It being incredibly obvious to me and not the party that trying to deal with the kind of time scale attempted this time around in such a court case merely underlines the difficulties that the court is inevitably confronted with. It is also my intention to crystallise out a statement of aspiration in paragraph five of the order the 12th December 2007 by directing the attendance of K, child in this jurisdiction in 2000 and nine on the basis that is apparently un contentious between the parties. And he may not be just a holiday but returned in case, in which case the court in every needs to be involved because they would be close to the future of contact can be considered. The mothers receive an assurance from the London borough of Newham they would undertake an assessment of their capacity to have unsupervised contact, which must be her first aspiration. If that is granted, where it will lead is, of course, a matter that stretches sufficiently far in the future to be very unwise for this court to make any comment about now. And that is an assessment to which, of course you must be entitled and is in a sense, which is of course futile without the presence of the child, or at least it could be started. But it cannot be completed without the presence of the stuff -- of the child. So those are matters about which I have no doubt which I will do course reduced in due course, reduce into order form that there needs the issue about this summer I contact in summer 2008, upon which, as upon many issues, the parties remained hopelessly divided. The judge recites parties arguments Paragraph 24, 25, 26. Now I do not, for one moment underestimate the importance of this matter to the perils. On the face of it, the mother makes a perfectly reasonable application. On the face of it, the father raises not unreasonable objections to visit taking place this summer. One simply has to recognise that this is so, one also has to acknowledge that is generally desirable strongly in the interests of a child to maintain a proper relationship with both his parents, both of whom, of course, at this stage live in the United Kingdom, which he does not. And so one recognises that in the ordinary circumstances, it is perfectly reasonable that matters should take place as contemplated. There's nothing ordinary about this case at all. The relationships are vindictive, the willingness to discuss is wholly absent nobody's able to speak without making any allegations against each other, and the whole thing is hopelessly fraught. That of course immediately to ask myself, What on earth is that I'm bringing this child into if I were to require to return? And I fear that what happened last time he was here and there was an issue about what happened to him, which I won't go into whichever account one chooses to look at, whether the mother or father does nothing but add to the concerns, then he makes further comments about the parents. And then he goes on Paragraph 29. I have, of course, no power, whatever to compel anyone in Pakistan to do anything. The only power I have is to compel the mother or the father by reason of their being parents and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the court. No one else is because, of course, the child is entirely lawfully in Pakistan. And indeed it is unusual that the court should be retaining jurisdiction in this case because, of course, the child is habitually resident in Pakistan and were this a European case the court would be positively deprived of jurisdiction by the structure of European parenting law, but it is not, and the court undoubtedly does have jurisdiction because both parties have not only submitted to the jurisdiction but have actually invoked it on a number of occasions. And so the question of jurisdiction of itself does not present a problem in this case, though, of course, the question of enforcement of orders might. I've considered the implications of that paragraph on a number of occasions of recent months, and were I to remove the two references to European, then there will be no difficulty. We'll come back onto the -- come back to the interpretation, if I may, a little later. But the point I want to emphasise is that the learned judge relied in his recent conclusion, the court undoubtedly does have jurisdiction on the fact the parties have not only submitted to the jurisdiction, but had actually invoked it on a number of occasions."

p1,00:33:53.130,00:34:34.550,spk_0,"The parents. Who were then, of course, up to the moment he made the order, the parties. Now that, and he then goes on two make to decide that it's impractical for the child to be brought to the country in 2008. Father agreed between the child in 2009 didn't agree in 2008. Mr Justice Hedley ruled that it was impractical for him to make an order at that date a 20th of June for that to happen."
p1,00:34:35.940,00:34:37.879,spk_3,He then directed as he said in paragraph [crosstalk].

p1,00:34:45.139,00:34:48.750,spk_2,So this is the stage at which the child becomes a party?
p1,00:34:49.240,00:34:50.600,spk_0,"Yes, doesn't say on the order."
p1,00:34:50.600,00:34:54.800,spk_2,But still we can see it in the reasons. And then
p1,00:34:56.040,00:34:57.460,spk_0,he explains --
p1,00:34:57.460,00:35:03.930,spk_3,"That's right is it? It is the order, is it? Maybe it doesn't really matter, actually."
p1,00:35:03.970,00:35:04.550,spk_0,But
p1,00:35:04.940,00:35:07.160,spk_3,been quite a lot of argument about just exactly when --

p1,00:35:08.440,00:35:09.940,spk_3,the purpose of seizing.
p1,00:35:10.490,00:35:13.170,spk_2,"It's a direction that's good enough, is it?"
p1,00:35:15.140,00:35:29.120,spk_0,"For my part or we have acted on the basis of child has from this point been a party. It doesn't say so in the order. What distinction would there be represented by a guardian, but not a party?"
p1,00:35:29.130,00:35:48.710,spk_1,"When I asked the question, because my recollection is that the law does provide for that. But given that this is what Justice Headley said in his judgment, I suspect that if anybody applied for the order to be amended under the slip rule, it would be done."
p1,00:35:48.720,00:35:54.710,spk_0,"I will, for my own peace of mind, if nothing else, check Your Ladyship. I'm always very anxious"
p1,00:35:54.710,00:35:55.760,spk_2,about disagreeing
p1,00:35:55.990,00:36:06.340,spk_0,"about the interpretation of Children Act for obvious reasons. I will check if it's right, a guardian can be appointed as Your Ladyship postulated without a child being a party."
p1,00:36:06.670,00:36:28.070,spk_2,"Well, I think the order of events and if I read this correctly, is that the garden was going to be appointed first. And then he says there upon the child, not right, the last line of Paragraph 31. And he should thereupon become a part of these proceedings. So you've got to have the guardian first. Does that make sense? That's what he seems to be saying."
p1,00:36:28.090,00:36:37.890,spk_0,"They're not -- if you forget the normal course of events, the guardian is only a pointed when -- for a party under a disability in guardian --"
p1,00:36:37.900,00:36:41.830,spk_2,"Yes, well, he's asking CAFCASS to appoint the guardian."
p1,00:36:42.430,00:37:01.460,spk_1,"But that's because CAFCASS actually supplies guardians. The logical order is to order that the child become a party and that the child then have a guardian who could be CAFCASS or could be from somebody else, and that's the logical order of doing it."
p1,00:37:02.480,00:37:10.790,spk_3,"Speaking for myself, it would be of assistance to look at Rule 95 of the family proceedings rules and, indeed, any other rule or statutory provisions which might bear on this section."

p1,00:37:12.960,00:37:13.500,spk_3,"Yes, certainly."

In other words, order made at the continuation hearing in front of District Judge Crowther in 2007. So it is a continuation of the proceedings that were started in 2007, as Lord Hope has reminded us. It has the same, bears the same number, and what happens thereafter"

p1,00:38:54.820,00:39:13.180,spk_3,"But just to follow this as we go along, these are the proceedings began in 2007, which are the relevant proceedings under article 12 (3), is that right? Yes. And on your case are the only relevant parties to those proceedings the parents --"
p1,00:39:13.620,00:39:14.040,spk_0,Well --
p1,00:39:14.520,00:39:50.730,spk_3,"On the hypothesis that there's only one set of proceedings and that seized means first seized. The logic would be that they are. Another possibility is that they somehow become new proceedings when the child is joined, because otherwise it makes very little sense of the expression all the parties. But we'll come back to that. But your cases it's the 2007 proceedings. We're only concerned with Article 12 (3), not Article 12 (1), is that right? Yes. And that the only parties to the proceedings are the parents? So whether the child ever agreed anything is irrelevant is that right?"
p1,00:39:50.730,00:39:55.290,spk_0,"That is, jumping ahead, that is my case on unequivocal acceptance."

Section 8, the jurisdictions based either on the Family Law Act 1986. I think there must be an, or, intended or the council regulation Brussels II revised. Paragraph 26, Given the child is in Pakistan, the council regulation is not applicable and the court needs to look at the physical present which residents have found jurisdiction. Q is not physically present in the jurisdiction and no party seems to suggest he's habitually resident. Habitually resident is not subject to time, its meaning is essentially based on the facts and looking at all the circumstances of the case. Its meaning is similar to ordinary resident requires appreciable period of time to live in a particular place. Pakistan is clearly his place of habitual residence. There is, however, case law which provides a basis for jurisdiction, namely, where there is an application to vary a Section 8 order value made in the UK, notwithstanding the child was neither habitually resident nor present in the UK, see Re S, in which the court had jurisdiction even though the child had moved to live in Holland since an order was made. The father accepts the court has retained jurisdiction to make orders directed towards himself in relation to contact. Difficulty, as any orders in relation to contact cannot be enforced.

In the course of that hearing, we understand, I don't think any of counsel present now were instructed at that point. In the course of that hearing, Mrs Justice Black raised the question of whether the court had jurisdiction to make orders in respect of Q.

p1,00:58:04.260,00:58:07.010,spk_1,to the Council regulation for the purpose of jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings.
p1,00:58:08.150,00:58:09.180,spk_0,Different regulations.
p1,00:58:09.190,00:58:10.140,spk_1,Different regulations.
p1,00:58:10.620,01:00:10.740,spk_0,"Yes, if you look at tab -- just to try and make it less unclear. Tab 10 contains the version of the Family Law Act 1986. It was enforced before the 2005 amendment, which was implemented to take account of Brussels II revised, as we will go on to consider later. And the court knows, Brussels II revised is the successor to an early regulation Brussels II, and this previous version of the Family Law Act 1986 was had itself been amended with itself is out of an earlier amendment to take account of the earlier regulation. So when, when we see paragraph two on page four of the document, tab 10, Section 2 reads, then read as follows, that is immediately prior to April 2005, A court in England and Wales shall not have jurisdiction to make a Section 1 (1)(a) order with respect to a child in or in connection with matrimonial proceedings in England and Wales. Unless, a, a child concerned is the child of both parties to the matrimonial proceedings and the court has jurisdiction to entertain these proceedings by virtue of the council regulation, which, of course, is Brussels II. Or, b, the condition in Section 2 A of this Act satisfied. A court in England and Wales shall only have jurisdiction to make a Section 1 (1)(a) order in a non matrimonial case, that is to say, where the condition in Section 2(a) of the act is not satisfied unless the condition in Section 3 of this act is satisfied. And the reason for that distinction at that stage was Brussels II it was a regulation dealing with matrimonial cases and only covered issues of power and responsibility that arose in the context of such matrimonial proceedings, so."
p1,01:00:13.510,01:00:26.330,spk_3,So the effects of the change previously the court could make them while still now you can make an order in the context of matrimonial proceedings in relation to the child?
p1,01:00:32.010,01:00:32.060,spk_2,
p1,01:00:32.060,01:02:11.730,spk_0,"No, no. If we look at that, we compare the two versions, you'll see -- if we compare the two versions to the previous law provided in matrimonial cases, it would appear for alternative sets out as pure alternatives. Either you bring your -- in a matrimonial case, either you the child falls within 21(a) or 21(b). In either case, the court has jurisdiction. But under the new draft that's drafted rather differently, and it encompasses sweeps away the distinction between matrimony and non matrimonial cases, as does the regulation itself, as we'll see later and instead provide as follows, A court in England and Wales should not make a section one when they order with respect to a child, unless a, it has jurisdiction under the regulation or b, the regulation does not apply. But the question of making the order arise or connection matrimonial proceedings or the condition in section three is satisfied."
p1,01:02:12.300,01:02:20.520,spk_1,"And you say the regulation does apply, the court has jurisdiction under the regulation, and so we don't need to look at the bundle?"

p1,01:03:04.500,01:03:13.640,spk_0,you look first of all to see if you've got jurisdiction under Brussels II revised and only if you haven't do you consider whether you've got jurisdiction under the residual rule.
p1,01:03:13.650,01:03:47.820,spk_1,"Doesn't it go further than that? Only if the council regulation doesn't apply, which is different from saying you don't have jurisdiction under it, because the whole purpose of putting council regulation on top is that under the council regulation, you might not have jurisdiction. Another EU country would, in which case (b) couldn't apply. So it's not, you don't have jurisdiction under the council regulation, but it doesn't apply? That's a very important distinction."
p1,01:03:48.200,01:03:53.600,spk_0,Yes. Your ladyship was right to correct me. We'll come on to look at the regulation in --
p1,01:03:53.660,01:04:04.010,spk_1,"Supposing the regulation says Germany has jurisdiction. We don't have jurisdiction, but the regulation applies. And so we can't go hunting for some other basis to do it."
p1,01:04:04.790,01:06:48.220,spk_0,"That's right. That is the hierarchical. We'll look at the detail of the hierarchy is still that very clearly in the practise guide, which will come into in a moment. Now just to go on, then, with the story, the history. In the course of that argument, the judge asked for further submissions on the issue of forum non conveniens. In other words, were he to decide that the court had jurisdiction, as argued for on behalf of the mother, he wanted them to consider and have helped as to whether or not he should grant a stay on the grounds of forum non conveniens to stay of the proceedings and arguments were addressed on that on the next day. And on that on that point, mother of course contended that these courts were convenient forum and the guardian's position is interesting. She had he season he had opposed, he had argued against the jurisdictional part, in other words, holding, submitting that the court did not have jurisdiction. But if he was wrong about that, he argued that it was a convenient forum. Yeah, Judge Barnes judgement was handed down on the 28th of May and he held that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the applications. However, he further held that if there was application to entertain -- sorry, jurisdiction to entertain the applications, he would have refused to grant a stay of the applications on the ground and formed opinions. I mentioned that because I think Lord Justice thought with great respect, has erred in paragraph nine of his judgement when he says, if you look at the appealed judgement, which is tab two it's immediately, it's in your core, your Lordship, Courts copy. It's in the core, a whole bundle, she says in paragraph nine, He's corrected Lord Justice I have re read his judgement I assure the court. But that's not what he said when he was giving it extra."
p1,01:06:48.620,01:06:51.210,spk_2,I

He hasn't changed that, but he has corrected himself. I apologised to him in paragraph -- what he says about, he's got it right and I got it wrong. So we then appealed. Mother then appealed. And,"

p1,01:07:15.230,01:07:49.750,spk_0,"we've got the judgement of the Court of Appeal hand in and that sets out what happened thereafter. I was then instructed the argument for the Court of Appeal was framed very differently. We put forward the Brussels II revised arguments, which we now advance before this court. We argued that the jurisdictional question fell first to be considered under Brussels II revised. Otherwise, the hierarchical order,"
p1,01:07:50.580,01:07:51.530,spk_2,as we've looked at
p1,01:07:51.530,01:09:03.400,spk_0,"already needed to be considered that on that basis, we submitted that the court had part, that there was a power of prorogation under Article 12 (3) that extended to all children in theory, wherever they are, wasn't confined to a sort of European ambit. That the requirements for interrogation in Article 12 were satisfied and we, and we also in our written case, although this wasn't developed an oral argument. We argued that following the decision of the European Court in the Owusu case, the principle of forum non conveniens did not apply in cases where the jurisdiction was based on Brussel's regulations. Alternatively, of course, we relied on Judge Banett's findings that this was the convenient forum. The Court of Appeal didn't go on to consider forum non conveniens because they determined that the court did not have jurisdiction."
p1,01:09:04.870,01:09:05.020,spk_2,The
p1,01:09:05.020,01:09:40.529,spk_0,"court rejected the submission that the prorogation powers under Article 12 (3) provisions extended to Children who were habitually resident outside the EU. The court held any event we didn't satisfy the hurdles for prorogation under Article 12 (3) and dismissed the appeal. Hence our appeal to this court and the -- that's all I propose to say about the facts or history of the case. At this stage, there may be other matters which we need to look at it."
p1,01:09:40.750,01:09:41.650,spk_2,Very much. Unless the
p1,01:09:41.650,01:09:44.839,spk_0,court wishes me to go back over anything further we admitted.
p1,01:09:44.850,01:09:45.830,spk_2,That's very helpful.
p1,01:09:45.970,01:12:35.380,spk_0,"On page 9 of the statement of issues I outlined the issues. These are these are agreed, although I will just mention this Brussel. But I remember agreement from her document. Obviously, we have a very quickly to get this this document. Broadly speaking, these are the issues that are raised before you. There are we raised the issues and we I put before the court we put before the court the issues under three headings the primacy of the Brussels II revised provision of jurisdiction, the scope and application of the provisions of Article 12 for Brussels II revised interrogation and the application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Now taking those in turn, I'm on page nine of my statement of facts document paragraph two. The first issue we raises is the primacy of the Brussels II revised provisions. That is not controversial as between the parties representatives before you. As you will see from Miss Russell's document, she accepts on behalf of her client our submissions to the privacy of the Brussels II revised provisions. But I will spend a little, not long, a little time just to lining our argument about that in due course, because of what follows from it. Secondly, we identify a number of matters arising under Article 12 free itself. And this is at the heart of the case. Paragraph 4. The first we mentioned the meaning of habitually resident. Now that point, strictly speaking, doesn't arise in this case because all parties are agreed. But whatever test is applied, Q is habitually resident in Pakistan and his parents are habitually resident in this country. Yeah, we, in other words, we're not seeking to float what would be a highly optimistic argument, that Q had retained to have had two official residences. We say the factual position is clear. However, we and it will be Mr Devereux who will be developing these arguments if called on by the court. We invite the court to consider whether it would be helpful and appropriate to consider issues of habitual residence and that arise in Brussel's law"

The final heading is forum non conveniens . Now again, on this point, there isn't an issue between the parties for the purposes of this appeal. And Miss Russell will correct me if I'm summarising her case incorrectly, she accepts, as I understand it, she accepts the thrust of our submissions about forum non conveniens so far as Brussels II revised is concerned. Her cases is that the issues which are covered would normally be covered under the doctrine of forum non conveniens are adequately catered for by other provisions within the regulation, of course, one can immediately see similarities between the forum non conveniens test and the best interests test. But I went straight to that argument. At that point, we'll come onto that and so those are the issues. For our part"

p1,01:17:37.930,01:17:40.500,spk_2,Don't feel you have to go into great detail if it's already written down.
p1,01:17:40.580,01:18:38.120,spk_0,"Thank you. Well, I won't. Could I just draw your attention, then my lord to the practice guide. Now, that is in tab two in the authorities bundle. So green files volume one tab two. Page 12. [Pause]. A court seized with a request concerning for responsibility has to make the following analysis, Do I have jurisdiction pursuant to the general rules? Article eight. I have of course not -- I'm sorry. Does your Lordship wish me in any way to recite or go through the Brussels II revised to which we'll be looking at?"

p1,01:18:54.810,01:20:10.580,spk_0,"Well, we don't have to, but reverting then to my submissions, but looking at the flowchart, the court asked, Do I have jurisdiction to consider the general rule, general being habitual residence of the child. Yes, I have jurisdiction. If no, do I have jurisdiction to Articles 9 to 10, 12 or 13? If yes, I have jurisdiction. If no, does another court in another member state have jurisdiction over the regulation after 17? If yes, this is Lady Lady Hale's point, I must declare of my own motion that I do not have jurisdiction. It's only the answer to all those questions is no that the court that no court is competent under the regulation and in those circumstances, either judge can exercise any jurisdiction available under my national law, the residual law. So the effect of the regulation is in my submission quite radical because it is confined, the domestic rules about jurisdiction to the very relatively narrow circumstances in which none of"

p1,01:20:29.370,01:20:50.750,spk_1,Of course the main point about the Family Law Act 1986 was not to fix jurisdiction as between courts of the United Kingdom and other courts. It was the result of a treaty between the English and the Scots as to jurisdiction within the United Kingdom.

p1,01:27:07.550,01:27:40.580,spk_0,"A different lifetime. I think it would be the case that it would be seen as parens patriae, the child is a citizen and the court might have -- would have a discretion of jurisdiction, would have jurisdiction, but would have a discretion whether not to exercise it.

p1,01:27:40.590,01:27:54.090,spk_1,"It had a lot of, a lot of effect on cross border situations. And, of course, some of our standard practises like the undertaking, given by the father instead would have developed a wardship."

p1,01:29:25.230,01:29:41.080,spk_3,"Article 12(2) that is what is meant by, the jurisdiction shall cease. If the jurisdiction has already been properly exercised, why would not any ancillary question like, what variation during the minority. Suppose the original order was during the minority."

The prorogation, if you look at article 12 1, 12 1 gives the court jurisdiction pro gives prorogation, jurisdiction in matrimonial cases. But that ceases as soon as the marriage comes to an end. The divorce proceedings come to an end, alternatively, where the PR proceedings are still pending, at that point, a final judgment is made. All the proceedings come to an end for another reason."

p1,01:33:39.550,01:33:40.220,spk_0,No.
p1,01:33:40.510,01:33:42.280,spk_1,That's common ground?
p1,01:33:42.280,01:33:48.300,spk_0,We are. Although I do take Lord Clarke's point that one no doubt that we will look to see how they relate.
p1,01:33:48.410,01:33:55.410,spk_2,"Well, you need to know that to get into Article 12 (3), don't you? Because it says proceedings other than those referred to in paragraph 1. But if it's common ground --"
p1,01:33:55.420,01:34:10.220,spk_0,"Yes, but in this case, it doesn't rise because there was nothing like a liberty to apply provision, which could possibly be regarded as enabling the order to continue, procedures to continue in any interpretation."
p1,01:34:10.240,01:34:20.300,spk_1,Isn't there a better answer that no orders relating to this child were made in the course of the divorce proceedings? This was not --
p1,01:34:20.310,01:34:21.320,spk_0,"Well, I don't know whether that's right."
p1,01:34:21.680,01:34:23.550,spk_1,"Well, we need to find out."
p1,01:34:23.560,01:34:31.520,spk_0,"I don't know, I'm assuming not because, of course, the care proceedings were contemporaneous divorce proceedings, and I'm assuming it was dealt with. I don't know that."
p1,01:34:32.320,01:34:36.400,spk_2,You have to say something about children in the divorce.
p1,01:34:36.400,01:34:37.330,spk_0,You do.
p1,01:34:37.330,01:34:44.390,spk_1,But you don't have to make orders. The whole point is you don't make orders most of the time. And most of the orders are made independently under the Children Act.
p1,01:34:44.710,01:34:45.360,spk_0,"2002 yes, that was still."
p1,01:34:45.370,01:35:05.960,spk_1,"That's the general proposition. And so it would be unlikely for there to be orders that were made in the course of the matrimonial proceedings, and in any event, where there are care proceedings going on contemporaneously, they're definitely separate from the matrimonial proceedings. And the fundamental order in this case, the residents order to dad was made in the care proceedings."
p1,01:35:06.740,01:35:07.240,spk_2,Yes.
p1,01:35:07.310,01:35:11.310,spk_1,That must be why it's common ground that we're not concerned with the matrimonial basis of jurisdiction.
p1,01:35:11.420,01:35:17.380,spk_2,"Historically, the care proceedings have begun before the separation. So they were ongoing?"
p1,01:35:17.390,01:35:24.060,spk_0,"Yes. Yes, I will just check. Your Lordship's right, we need to know exactly. I will check that. To see a copy of the order which will be the matrimonial proceedings."
p1,01:35:24.840,01:35:25.870,spk_3,
p1,01:35:28.840,01:35:30.410,spk_1,"Yes, that would be the decree."
p1,01:35:31.810,01:35:43.750,spk_0,"Decree, and whatever order, if any, was made so far as a child was concerned, I suspect there is none, but I'll have to check."
p1,01:35:43.750,01:35:46.580,spk_1,There would be the usual certificate.
p1,01:35:46.580,01:36:18.710,spk_0,"There would have been. Would it be in the same form as now? Yes, we're 2002. Anyway. So that's that's, how do we get on to that now? I'm now moving on to the prorogation powers. And at this point in our argument that we touch on habitual residence. But I've said more than I intended to in any way about habitual residents. And I'm going to leave that argument to Mr Devereux."
p1,01:36:18.720,01:36:21.050,spk_2,So we're onto --
p1,01:36:21.530,01:36:22.230,spk_0,And my case --
p1,01:36:22.230,01:36:23.980,spk_2,Paragraph 45?
p1,01:36:24.230,01:37:08.640,spk_0,"Yes, that's right. The first question to be considered under Article 12 is whether the power to prorogue jurisdiction extends to children who are habitually resident in a state that is not a member state of the EU. The rationale for Article 12 is to provide an exception to the general rule. The jurisdiction matters of PR has converged on the member state of the child's habitual residence. Article 12, as well already identified provides two powers of propagation in matters of parental possibility. One in matrimonial, the other in non matrimonial proceedings. This case concerns a non matrimonial case."
p1,01:37:10.530,01:37:10.940,spk_2,
p1,01:37:11.450,01:38:39.850,spk_0,"The first issue arising is whether that power is confined as his contended on behalf of the father, to children who are habitually resident within the EU or extends to all children. As we contend. If that construction is correct, jurisdiction could be paraded to cover. Q. Provided the criteria Article 12 for you are satisfied before I turn to the question of third State. Could I just invite the court to look at Article 12 (3) and its predecessor. Article 12 (3), which you have open in front of you, reads, well, the first part of it reads, The courts of a member state should also have jurisdiction in relation to proceedings other than those referred to in paragraph 1. Now its predecessor was -- I realised I've also not in the course of the argument gone through the history of the Brussels regulations that is set out in full in my document, I assume, might even know that. Yes."
p1,01:38:40.820,01:38:41.050,spk_2,The
p1,01:38:41.050,01:41:01.030,spk_0,"predecessor to Brussels II revised was, of course, Brussels II. And that is a tab 6 in the authorities bundle volume one. And the comparison I wish to draw is, in fact, between the old article 3 under Brussels II and in fact, strictly, it's the matrimonial jurisdiction, article 12 (1). Because, of course, there was no equivalent to Article 12 (3) in the Brussels II regulations. So if I could invite the court to have Brussels II at tab six, Article 31 and Brussels II revised Article 12, run open and compare the two. So tab 1 10 6 Brussels II Article 31 says the courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction by virtue of article to an application for divorce and legal separation of marriage annulment shall have jurisdiction in respect, in respect of matters, respect a matter of principle, overcharging both prizes where the child is habitually resident in that member state to where the child is not a bit she resident in the member state referred to in paragraph one. Yeah, the court of that state shall have jurisdiction shut a matter if the child is in which the present in one of the member states and and then the two tests are set out. At least one of the spouses has PR, and the jurisdiction has been accepted by the spouses and is in the best interests of the child."
p1,01:41:03.710,01:41:06.230,spk_2,The word prorogation is not used --
p1,01:41:06.810,01:41:07.450,spk_0,No.
p1,01:41:07.460,01:41:11.540,spk_2,At all in heading or anywhere else in this regulation.
p1,01:41:12.310,01:43:25.140,spk_0,"No, it's not. But the point is that I succeed to make is that in those circumstances, under Article 3, there is an express reference to habitual residents. So where the child is not habitually resident in the member state, the court of that state shall have jurisdiction in such matters. If the child habitual resident in one of the member states and the test is satisfied, police are satisfied. Contrast Article 12, which of course, is headed prorogation, The courts of a member state exercising jurisdiction in divorce proceedings shall have jurisdiction in relation any matter where any parents really connected with that application, where and then the hurdles are inserted. So there is no reference, no restriction there to children who are habitually resident in one of the member states. [Pause]. And in our submission, there's no justification for reading into Article 12 (1). Or more importantly, for this case, Article 12 (3). The phrase in respect of a child who is habitually resident in a member state. I think this is a rhetorical point. If the authors had intended to limit the scope of the jurisdictional rules to cases where the trial was a fixture at the member state, given that they said so now in Brussels II we submit they surely would have done in Brussels II revised. Another way of putting that is that the commission must be presumed to be deliberate. Yes, My Lord, and that first point --"
p1,01:43:25.150,01:43:28.690,spk_1,Aren't we back to the meaning of third state in Article 12?
p1,01:43:28.700,01:43:46.690,spk_0,"Well, I've now moved, that my Lady, that's the central issue. The first issue between my learned friend and myself and of course the short point is we say third state means non member state, in short, we say it's a term of art in EC law to mean non member state."
p1,01:43:46.970,01:43:51.650,spk_1,"And if so, 12 (4) provides that it's possible for jurisdiction to --"
p1,01:43:51.660,01:43:52.780,spk_0,Precisely.

p1,01:43:55.000,01:44:09.580,spk_0,"12(4) only makes sense if, we submit it only makes sense if 12 (3) applies to children who have been resident in third states. But really, we're jumping ahead. Forgive me for saying so because"
p1,01:44:09.580,01:44:10.440,spk_1,it is
p1,01:44:10.440,01:44:15.410,spk_0,contend-able of the father that third state does not in this context mean non member state.
p1,01:44:16.190,01:44:20.800,spk_1,"Yes, I understand that. But as it seems to be rather crucial to the argument of construction."
p1,01:44:21.210,01:44:30.920,spk_0,"Well, because we say it's absolutely clear it's -- we've cited a few examples a rather long passage from general report"
p1,01:44:31.890,01:44:32.050,spk_2,to
p1,01:44:32.050,01:44:46.590,spk_0,illustrate it. But there are numerous other examples in EU law of third state being used to mean non member meaning in the context non member state. And there is no we've been unable to
p1,01:44:46.590,01:44:47.620,spk_1,find any
p1,01:44:48.090,01:45:03.800,spk_0,"conceivable possible interpretation of that phrase in any case or EU legislation to mean anything for any construction, possible construction of third state, meaning anything other than non member state."
p1,01:45:03.960,01:45:17.800,spk_2,"You've said, and I think this may be right, Miss Russell will tell us later that she is saying, well, that may be all very well in other contexts. But when we're looking at this particular context, third state must mean a member state. Well,"
p1,01:45:18.690,01:45:30.420,spk_0,"My Lord, we submit that that it's a term which is only capable of one, of one meaning. I think your postered that is perplexing when it has been used in the"

p1,01:45:46.390,01:48:17.590,spk_0,"It's not defined. Would that it were defined conclusively. I might just, Mr Setright was going to invite the court, perhaps to suggest possible amendments to the regulation. And certainly a definition section seems arguably, a definition of the phrase seems maybe necessary. We say it's not, we say it's clear. It's only mentioned twice the phrase third state in the regulations and the second in Article 61. We say this demonstrates beyond any conceivable argument. With respect to my learned friend that third state means non member state. Article 61 is about the relationship between this regulation and the Hague Convention 1996 on the jurisdiction applicable on recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children, which I shall call the 1996 Hague Convention for short. It reads as follows, As regards, as concerns relation with the 1996 Hague Convention, this regulation shall apply (a) where the child concerned has his or her habitual residence on the territory of a member state, (b) as concerns the recognition and enforcement of a judgement given in a court of a member state on the territory of another member state, even if the child concerned has his or her habitual residence on the territory of a third state, which is a contracting party to the said convention. In other words, the regulation always applies where the child is habitually resident in a third state and in addition, applies where the child is habitually resident on a third i.e. non member state as concerns the recognition and enforcement of a judgment given the member state A on the territory of member state B. There is no possible way that, we submit, in which third state in Article 61 can mean anything other than non member state. And it would, in our submission, be astonishing if any other interpretation was possible of the other reference to third state in the regulation."

p2,00:00:45.440,00:01:01.160,Appellant ,"Before leaving the topic of Third State, My Lord, I was wondering whether the court would be assisted by some consideration of the rationale, for the interpretation or whether that would be unnecessary given what we would say is the absolute pure meaning of the phrase."
p2,00:01:02.790,00:01:08.690,Judge,"Well, you've taken us quite some distance. I think let's see how the case progresses. I think you can move on to the next topic."
p2,00:01:08.880,00:01:13.560,Judge,One question. How would it work if it meant another Member State?
p2,00:01:14.540,00:01:16.560,Appellant ,"In Brussels, in the Article 12."
p2,00:01:16.570,00:01:27.780,Judge,"Yes, because you can't -- as between Member States, it's a first in time rule, isn't it?"
p2,00:01:27.850,00:01:31.200,Appellant ,"It is. There is the first in time rule. And in addition, of course there's Article 15."
p2,00:01:34.460,00:01:35.070,Judge,Yes.
p2,00:01:35.540,00:02:01.030,Appellant ,"Which is, as I understand it, My Lordship will know better than I, is an entirely novel provision, or of a type which is unknown elsewhere in international law. For consensual transfer between -- that's not right. It's certainly unusual, consensual transfer between one jurisdiction and another."
p2,00:02:01.080,00:02:10.649,Judge,"I thought it's 19 (2), that gives the first in time rule."

p2,00:02:32.140,00:03:40.260,Appellant ,"Why is it in this format? I'm not sure I have the answer, so it may well be, it would be a waste of time to seek to try to explain it. The obvious point is that in the enlarged community there are a very large number of people of a wide variety of nationalities, living within -- citizens of Member States, living in other Member States and citizens of non Member States living within the EU, not least the substantial number of Pakistani citizens or people of Pakistani descent living in this country amongst many others. And they are entitled to the same consideration when looking at the overall purpose of the regulation to facilitate the area, creation of an area of freedom, security, and justice. They are entitled to the same rights as all other persons within the EU as part of the overall goal of the EU in achieving free movement of persons."
p2,00:04:01.940,00:04:24.150,Judge,"Just going again to paragraph four, where it says the third party, third state rather, which is not a contracting party of the Hague Convention, just a footnote to our previous discussion, if the state is a party to the Hague Convention, is the position that the same position exists under the Hague Convention, as exists under the regulation or what?"
p2,00:04:24.160,00:04:30.650,Appellant ,"Well, no, because the Hague Convention is a matrimonial."
p2,00:04:30.650,00:04:36.310,Judge,"So what's the rationale of limiting paragraph 4 to third states, not a contracting party?"
p2,00:04:36.340,00:04:53.960,Appellant ,"Our case is that 12 (3) applies to all children, wherever habitually resident and 12 (4) creates the deeming provision, which we will come onto in a moment, in respect of the children who are actually resident in a non-Hague convention country."
p2,00:04:53.970,00:05:14.510,Judge,"I suppose your basic point about rationale is that if you've got parties who are in the EU or in a Member State of the EU, and they want to use the courts of the jurisdiction where they happen to be in order to decide the future of their children, why shouldn't they?"
p2,00:05:14.520,00:05:45.050,Appellant ,"Exactly. And that is,  and that right is something which should be enjoyed by all persons resident within the Union. Those who are citizens of Member States and those who are not, but are resident and working here. It's entirely consistent with the aims of the EU for the free movement of persons."
p2,00:05:46.340,00:06:48.000,Judge,"There's no one who knows more about this than Professor Alegria Borrás. She says another rule related to the 1996 Hague convention is paragraph 4 of Article 12, which aims to solve what I have always considered an artificial problem. The objective of the rule is to clarify that Article 52, I think that is of the Hague Convention, doesn't affect children who do not hold habitual residence in a State party to the convention, which is obvious. However, the solution for those cases is somewhat strange because after having clarified that The Hague convention does not apply, it then adds that it will be presumed that jurisdiction under that Article is in the interest of the child, a disposition which has been qualified as an excessive exercise of community terrorisation of judicial jurisdiction related to the supposed interest of the child, then citing some other Spanish material."
p2,00:06:51.280,00:07:49.450,Appellant ,"Well, it does, there are issues of comity, which Miss Russell relies on, and they are recognised in some of the academic discussion. But in my submission to the court, is the meaning is absolutely clear. It is arguable whether it is from the competence of the EU to have done what it's done. But it has done it. In my submission, it is absolutely clear. I wanted to go back to try to just explore, without having the answers, I'm afraid, My Lord, the interconnection between 1996 Convention and that again involves looking at Dr Borrás' report in 1998 and having the Hague Convention and the regulation opened. The Hague Convention is at tab 4, isn't it, in volume 1 and,  Article 10 on the third page, provides an equivalent to the article, the non revised original Brussels II provision. In other words, a prorogation in respect of a child habitually resident in another contracting State. So without prejudice to the previous articles which established the basic jurisdictional rules, the authorities of a contracting State under the Hague Convention exercising jurisdiction decide upon an application for divorce or legal separation of the parents of a child habitually resident in another contracting State or for annulment of their marriage may, if the law of the State so provides, take measures directed to the protection of the personal property of such child if at the time of commencement of the proceedings, one of his or her parents habitually resides in that State and one of them has parental responsibility in relation to the child and (b), the jurisdiction of these authorities to take such measures has been accepted by the parents as well as by any other person who has parental responsibility in relation to the child and is in the best interests of the child. And then the jurisdiction ceases, you will see the similar terms. If we compare that with Brussels, we already looked at Brussels, the original Brussels II at tab 6, you'll remember that is in very similar terms to the Article 3 (2)."
p2,00:10:05.620,00:10:06.060,Judge,Yeah.
p2,00:10:06.940,00:10:18.890,Appellant ,"Now, Dr Borrás' commentary about this is quite interesting, at tab 9 in the same bundle. This is Dr Borrás' report, in case it is not clear, is the explanatory report prepared for the Convention, we jumped ahead of this this morning, but before initially, the plan was that the new EU rules and procedures about jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of matrimonial cases, was to be the subject of a convention rather than a regulation. But in the event, the draft convention was converted into a regulation. I'm sure I use inelegant and inaccurate language, but that's what happened. This report is an explanatory report for the convention that became the regulation, Brussels II, Dr Borrás'. And can I ask you, please, turn to page 12 and 13, and beginning at paragraph 35 you see a heading, parental responsibility. Paragraph 35 simply recites paraphrases Article 3 of Brussels II. And then she says this, paragraph 36. The structure and content of this provision are the product of difficult negotiation, both within the community and in relation to worldwide provisions, particularly the 1996 Hague Convention. The fact that the community Convention limits itself to children habitually resident in the Member State facilitates its compatibility with the Hague Convention. The agreement between the Member States to include this matter within the scope of the Convention simply transferred the problem to the establishment of grounds for jurisdiction. Since while there were no problems where the child is habitually resident in the State as authorities have jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings, the same does not apply to cases where the child is habitually resident in another Member State. The problem is further complicated by the fact that Article 52 (2) of the Hague Convention provides that the Convention does not affect the possibility of one or more contracting States to conclude agreements which contain, in respect of children habitually resident in any of the States parties to such agreements, provisions on matters governed by that Convention. As a result, where both Conventions are in force -- remember, by both Conventions, she means Hague and the anticipated Brussels Convention. The Convention to which this report relates will take precedence in respect of children resident in Member States of the EU which are party to it. Whereas the Hague Convention will apply to other cases. There are no problems in relation to Article 3 (1), which establishes jurisdiction in the matter relating to parental responsibility over a child of both spouses where the child is habitually resident in the Member State, whose authorities also exercise jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings. It needs to be made clear that in no case does that provision mean that it must be the same authority in the State concerned to rule on the matrimonial and the parental responsibility. The rule is intended not only to establish that the authorities deciding on both matters are authorities of the same State. In practise, they will be the same authorities in some States and separate authorities in others. For the purpose of the Convention, the only point of interest is that they'd be authorities of the same Member State with due regard for internal distribution of competence. Paragraph 2 sets out the conditions under which the authorities of the Member State exercising jurisdiction on the divorce also have jurisdiction to decide parental responsibility, where the child is resident, not in that State but in another Member State. Both the following conditions have to be met. At least one of the spouses must have responsibility in relation to the child, and the jurisdiction of the courts must be accepted by the spouses and must be in the best interests of the child. This provision is taken from Article 10 (1) of the 1996 Hague Convention, which guarantees that there is no contradiction between Article 3 (2) of the Convention under discussion and the relevant provisions of the Hague Convention. The relevant provision of the Hague convention is practically the same thing, the only difference being that, in addition to requiring that one of the parents has responsibility, it also requires that at the time of the commencement proceedings, one of the parents habitually resides in that state. The difference derives from the differing subject matters of the two Conventions. The Hague Convention deals with the protection of children, whereas the Convention to which this report relates deals in matrimonial matters and for that reason the parents connection with the territory of a State for the purpose of determining jurisdiction in matrimonial matters is determined by the grounds set out in Article 2. Article 3 (2) is designed to cover one particular situation in which the best solution is to use the same grounds of the Hague Convention. So the important point is that, according to Dr Borrás, the terms of the original Brussels II regulation in this regard, were effectively designed to facilitate compatibility with the Hague Convention."
p2,00:15:01.540,00:15:52.060,Judge,"Well, isn't the effect of Article 52 of the Hague Convention that where the two competing States are subject to another international instrument, which I think for this purpose would include the Brussels II regulation, it's that other instrument which prevails, and that is the same solution as in Article 61. So that's dealing with two member states, one of whom may be subject, or both of whom may be subject to the Hague Convention. The Brussels II revised trumps anything in the Hague Convention. And then that would then make sense of 12 (4) telling you what relevance the Hague Convention might have when it's a non Member State."
p2,00:15:52.440,00:16:13.960,Appellant ,"Yes. In other words, the Hague convention, when it's a non Member State, it's not a signatory, as Pakistan to the Hague Convention, then the deeming provision comes into play. And that illustrates, we say, that third state means non Member State."
p2,00:16:17.140,00:16:22.060,Judge,If the third state is a Hague Convention country then the Hague Convention applies as between the Member State and the third.
p2,00:16:32.940,00:16:34.970,Appellant ,"Yes, but only in so far as the Convention makes provision."
p2,00:16:55.040,00:17:50.470,Appellant ,"And the Brussels II revised, because it goes beyond Brussels II into non matrimonial cases, does not therefore involve or require something which is compatible with Article 10 of the Hague Convention. Of course, the other point to make is that Article 8 and 9 of the Hague Convention contain a power which anticipates Article 15 of Brussels II. Article 15 is the provision Brussels II Revised. Article 15 of the Brussels II revised is the provisions which provides for consensual transfer between Member States. And there are similar provisions as between contracting states in Articles 8 and 9 of the Hague Convention."
p2,00:17:50.480,00:17:51.920,Judge,Was that in Brussels II?
p2,00:17:52.030,00:17:52.560,Appellant ,No.
p2,00:17:53.340,00:17:54.250,Judge,Only in the revised?
p2,00:17:54.260,00:17:55.670,Appellant ,Only in the revised.
p2,00:17:57.480,00:18:01.230,Judge,Did Dr Borrás opine about the Revised Brussels II?
p2,00:18:01.240,00:18:26.050,Appellant ,"No. Again, Lord Collins, correct me if I'm wrong, first of all, as I understand it, there was no explanatory report preceding the Brussels II Revised. There are various preparatory acts and comments from various bodies within the EU, but nothing of the status of Dr Borrás' report. And I am I right, My Lord?"
p2,00:18:23.530,00:18:27.310,Judge,As far as I know.
p2,00:18:27.310,00:19:44.450,Appellant ,"That's why I'm struggling. But anyway, that is a theory as to why it is drafted as it is, my point being that if the existence of the power of consensual transfer between contracting states under the Hague Convention, it might be thought that that would anticipate and deal in practical terms with the sort of difficulties that might arise where there were contrasting competing claims for jurisdiction. Rather than having one country unilaterally declare imperiously seize jurisdiction, respect of a child who is not habitually resident, to deal with it consensually. That is obviously the way forward, one might think, and Article 15 anticipates that. But it doesn't arise in respect of countries that are not parties to the 1996 convention. That, My Lord, completes all I had wanted to say about third state. [Inaudible] I just put forward any further on that topic before I move to my next topic, which is the criteria for prorogation under under 12 (3)?"
p2,00:19:44.460,00:19:47.450,Judge,"Yes, I think you can move on. Thank you."
p2,00:19:48.640,00:21:06.960,Appellant ,"Article 12 (3) of Brussels II Revised specifies three criteria for the prorogation of jurisdiction by courts of a Member State in matters of responsibility over a child, all of which have to be satisfied, namely, one, that the child has a substantial connection with that Member State. Article 12 (3) (a). Two that the jurisdiction of the court has been accepted expressly or otherwise, in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. Article 12 (3) (b). And three, the jurisdictions in the best interests of the child. Article 12 (3) (b) again. Now as far as the first criterion is concerned, Article 12 (3) (a), that is manifestly satisfied, and this is not contentious because under Article 12 (3) (a) itself specifically provides that a substantial connection will be established, in particular, by virtue of the fact that one of the holders of parental responsibility is habitually resident in that Member State or the child is a national of that Member State. In this case, both of those exemplar conditions are satisfied and consequently, as agreed by all parties, the child has a substantial connection with this country."
p2,00:21:26.190,00:21:41.240,Judge,"Why should there be the alternatives? I can understand the first one because it has some bearing on enforceability, but the second alternative is rather detached from that. I don't quite understand. But anyway, there it is."
p2,00:21:42.130,00:21:56.260,Judge,"It's very common in European conflicts law for nationality to be a connecting factor. Isn't that correct? We, of course, in the common law countries tended to go for [inaudible]. Habitual residence was the new kid on the block, so to speak. But the civilian countries tended to go for nationality."
p2,00:22:03.790,00:22:05.060,Judge,There was parents [inaudible].
p2,00:22:09.140,00:22:12.560,Judge,Yes. The wardship is actually an exception to that.
p2,00:22:13.840,00:24:14.450,Appellant ,"I don't think I can add to that debate, My Lady, because I've obviously been focusing on the more contentious aspects as far as [inaudible] is concerned. And so I turn to the other two hurdles, which I have to get over and the first is that the jurisdiction the court has been expressed accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. And there are two components of that which we need to consider. And the first I want to consider is at the time the court is seized. And of course, here there is a distinction between -- the issue is, does that refer to a specific event in time, meaning when the court is first seized, or a continuum of time, such a period of time as the court is seized? The Court of Appeal held that it meant the latter. It's our submission that it means the former. Although crucially, of course, later events are relevant in determining the position at the outset of the proceedings. We rely on a number of points in support of our preferred interpretation. We submit that the word, has been, in Article 12 (3) (b), is more consistent with a specific point in time. We point to the fact that under Article eight, the same phrase is used. Articulate the basic general jurisdiction. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of principle, over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seized. It is our submission to the court that the contrary interpretation would drain any meaning or effectiveness from the articles, because the crucial purpose of a jurisdictional rule, in our submission, is to determine whether the court has jurisdiction at the start of the proceedings, so they continue to determine the issue."
p2,00:24:51.280,00:25:02.500,Judge,It's something that one determines [inaudible] doesn't it? Normally it's one of the first things you have to look at in order to decide whether the court can do anything. A preliminary issue.
p2,00:25:02.510,00:25:14.530,Appellant ,"We submit that's right. And once acquired, in our submission, the court retains jurisdiction during the currency of the proceedings, save in the absence of very clear provision to the contrary."
p2,00:25:14.600,00:25:19.870,Judge,At the time the court is seized is used in that sense in Brussels convention and in Brussels I.
p2,00:25:19.880,00:25:22.210,Appellant ,Brussels I. Yes.
p2,00:25:22.220,00:25:24.990,Judge,It would be difficult to see how Article 19 would otherwise work.
p2,00:25:25.000,00:25:27.250,Appellant ,Quite.
p2,00:25:27.260,00:25:35.950,Judge,"I'm not a linguist, but I've had a look at the French and the Italian, and they both talk about the date at which the court is seized."
p2,00:25:37.340,00:26:06.770,Appellant ,"I did consider some aspects of the French, but not this particular point. And looking at what the impact would be, in the context of this provision, which at the point is being linked to consent of the parties, it would open up the possibility of a party withdrawing consent at any point during the proceedings up to almost the delivery of judgment, in theory, if they wanted to. If at the time the court is seized means during the currency of the proceedings, and you have to show unequivocal acceptance or agreement throughout the court throughout that time, it would enable party who was dissatisfied with the course of the proceedings to withdraw consent at any point."
p2,00:26:30.240,00:26:35.050,Judge,"And is the expression, is in the best interests of the child, tested at the same moment?"
p2,00:26:35.130,00:27:05.960,Appellant ,"My submission to the court will be that it is, and may I come back to that My Lord? Because that is obviously a linked but different point. And again, towards the end of my submissions on this point, draw your attention back to the practise guide at page 12, tab 2 page 12, reminding ourselves, of course, this is only a persuasive authority, actually, it's 13. Top of the page, page 13. The question of jurisdiction is determined at the time the court is seized. Once a competent court is seized, in principle, it retains jurisdiction even if the child acquires habitual residence in another Member State during the course of the court proceeding. That, of course, is dealing with the Article 8 point and in my submission illustrates clearly the point that I've been making. Tab 2 page 13 top of the page. Now one of the factors which influenced the Court of Appeal's contrary interpretation was that it would preclude any party subsequently joined to the proceedings from having any right to refuse to accept jurisdiction. Obviously, parties can be added to the proceedings, all proceedings, not only family proceedings, and not infrequently are. And in this case, of course, the child as we've established was joined as a party to these proceedings. And Lord Justice Thorpe pointed out that if consent was confined to those parties who were parties at the outset of the proceedings, that would deprive a later joint party, in particular a child through the guardian, of the right to object to the court's jurisdiction. Well, My Lord, our response to that is, that's right, it does have that consequence, and the fact that it has that consequence does not, in our submission, in any way undermine the clear interpretation and meaning of the phrase. Parties added later cannot object, in our submission, to the jurisdiction. Although of course they can in this instance under the Children Act, invite the court not to make any order in the proceedings to which they have been joined. So we submit that Lord Justice Thorpe is right. It does have that consequence, but it is the clear consequence of the interpretation, which we say is absolutely absolutely clear on the words of the document."
p2,00:30:07.510,00:30:44.560,Judge,"What are the kind of issues that will be likely to be raised? Leaving aside the question of interpretation which, assuming that we accept your approach to interpretation on other issues, are they something that would go to issues of fact as to whether there truly was a substantial connection sufficient to satisfy 3 (a) and the best interests of the child point in 3 (b)? To be going to factual issues, should that be right?"
p2,00:30:45.740,00:30:48.850,Appellant ,Does your Lordship mean that those are issues which the guardian would [crosstalk]?
p2,00:30:48.860,00:31:25.310,Judge,"Well, I'm talking about the party who comes in later. Assuming that the Court is seized because the Court is satisfied at the outset that the tests are satisfied and there are the factual issues I mentioned, which presumably will have gone through the courts mind in deciding whether or not the jurisdiction was actually established. But if it is satisfied then, I just wonder to what extent facts are likely to really shift significantly if some other party comes in. The best interests issue, of course, is always open ground, and it would be an underlying question anyway for the Court in deciding what to do on the facts."
p2,00:31:25.320,00:31:25.860,Appellant ,Yes.
p2,00:31:26.540,00:31:41.550,Judge,I'm just trying to get a sense for the reality of somebody coming in later and to what extent he or she would be prejudiced from presenting arguments that really matter on the issue.
p2,00:31:41.560,00:31:50.940,Appellant ,My point to the Court is that they wouldn't be prejudiced from presenting arguments that really matter to the welfare of the child. And that's why I give the example of the no order principle.
p2,00:31:51.150,00:31:52.670,Judge,So why not? I didn't follow that.
p2,00:31:53.140,00:32:18.390,Appellant ,"Because they may not be able to object to jurisdiction, but under the jurisdiction, the Court has a very wide discretion about what orders to make and indeed, whether to make any orders at all. And if the guardian for example, in this case, felt that it was not in the best interest for the English Court to make an order in respect of the children, he or she could make submissions to that effect. The Court could well adopt those arguments."
p2,00:32:18.400,00:32:54.630,Judge,"Isn't the real point whether a later coming party should be able to withhold consent and thus deprive the earlier parties, the original parties, of the agreement that they had made to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court? Once you put it that way, and the other would be that the later coming party is stuck with the consent that the earlier parties have given. As between those two, which makes the most sense?"
p2,00:32:54.680,00:32:56.170,Appellant ,"Yes, that's --"
p2,00:32:56.220,00:33:00.650,Judge,"I'm not supplying an answer to my question, but that's what the issue is."
p2,00:33:00.650,00:33:24.090,Appellant ,"Our point is that it would have that effect and, in essence, particularly thinking of the guardian, the guardian would not be prejudiced in any way by being unable to challenge the jurisdiction because they, he or she, could, and would undoubtedly, make substantive submissions on the right order to be made, and that order might well be no order."
p2,00:33:24.240,00:33:35.070,Judge,"Absolutely, somebody coming in for the child can say, Well, I don't think you should be deciding this because it obviously ought to be decided in Pakistan and it will be in the best interests of the child that it is decided in Pakistan."
p2,00:33:35.550,00:33:37.560,Appellant ,And the judge could then make no order.
p2,00:33:37.640,00:33:39.370,Judge,"But that's a peculiarity of children proceedings. Whereas if you ask my question, that applies to all provisions of this nature, which will apply in other situations as well. Is it the original party's consent that matters? Or has it to which a third party coming in is stuck? Or can the third party deprive the original parties of the jurisdiction to which they have consented? I appreciate there is a factual issue of if actually they did consent."
p2,00:34:10.080,00:34:15.060,Appellant ,"In purely adversarial proceedings, one can see strong arguments why a party coming and should not be entitled. I suppose it could be argued that in the the less adversarial stroke, quasi inquisitorial nature family, children proceedings, different principles may apply. But if, for example, a grandparent, as often happens, I know you're considering grandparents in due course in this court. If grandparents apply and seek leave to join in these circumstances, could a grandmother say, I'm applying to be joined these proceedings so I can object to the jurisdiction? In our submission, that would offend a number of principles. But it's a hypothetical point in this case, that in our submission, there is no substantive, real disadvantage to those who represent children, which was the great concern of Lord Justice Thorpe, there is no real disadvantage for those who represent children if they are deprived of the right to object to jurisdiction in the circumstances in this case, given their clear power to a make submissions and recommendations according to the nature of orders that should --"
p2,00:35:17.090,00:35:19.260,Judge,"Even though that would have the effect of objecting to the jurisdiction, if the order sought on behalf of the child was that all these matters should be determined in the courts of Pakistan."
p2,00:35:30.540,00:35:32.860,Appellant ,"Well, yes, that's right."
p2,00:35:32.870,00:35:44.150,Judge,"It would have the effect absolutely contrary to what on the face of this provision appears to be the meaning, if it has your meaning, but if you can see that that would be the position --"
p2,00:35:44.390,00:35:47.860,Appellant ,This provision only establishes jurisdiction under the Children Act.
p2,00:35:47.870,00:35:54.300,Judge,"We would be making the order having considered the merits of the case, that's one advantage [cross talk]."
p2,00:35:54.530,00:36:30.430,Judge,"It would have the effect also of altering in effect Article 15 to extend it to non member states, because the whole point about Article 15 is that the court has jurisdiction but then there's a discretion if there's some other court within the community, the court at first seize can say, Well, I have jurisdiction, but it'd be better for these matters to be dealt with in the course of Italy, that's what Article 15 says. Now, in your analysis, you get to exactly the same results by your approach."
p2,00:36:31.460,00:36:37.500,Appellant ,Article 15 goes a lot further than simply a court disclaiming jurisdiction. It provides for the orderly transfer of jurisdiction.
p2,00:36:37.630,00:36:54.970,Judge,"Yes, but it's all about the courts of another Member State, the effect of the concessions made, if it's correct, and if it will be regarded by the European Court as correct, would be in effect to provide the same result on the application."
p2,00:36:54.980,00:37:24.070,Judge,"It isn't the same result with respect. It isn't. What it is is a court in the United Kingdom having assumed jurisdiction and having heard from everybody with an interest in the welfare of the child, applying Section 1 of the Children Act, i.e. that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration, deciding that in the particular facts and circumstances of the case, it is in the best interests of the child for the UK court to make no order. It's not transferring jurisdiction to Pakistan, it's not conceding jurisdiction."
p2,00:37:24.080,00:37:31.150,Judge,But it could do all those things which Article 15 is essentially focused on.
p2,00:37:31.150,00:37:32.600,Judge,It would do it in a very different way.
p2,00:37:32.600,00:37:34.900,Judge,But it can't have the same practical result.
p2,00:37:34.910,00:37:59.460,Judge,"On the wording of Article 15, it can't be operated unless the court actually has jurisdiction. It says, the Court having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter. So, I mean, the practical effect may in the end, be exactly the same. But it's just a means of addressing the problem, which you're having to face, of getting through the hurdles to get through to Article 12, the proper one."
p2,00:37:59.470,00:38:01.070,Appellant ,"Well, yes."
p2,00:38:01.080,00:38:47.150,Judge,"But can I ask you just one point? That is, on the factual matrix of what we're looking at. Assume that since the date of first seizure, if one is looking at that as a point of time, a particular date, there's a change in the habitual residence by the one person with parental responsibility who satisfied the test at the beginning, suppose there's a change later on. That, I suppose, is a fact which could have a bearing on the order the court would make at the end of the day anyway, because presence of parents in jurisdictions matters a lot to what orders you are going to make. So really the whole whole factual issue can be addressed as part of the substance, even though it isn't available as a point on jurisdiction."
p2,00:38:47.820,00:39:16.160,Appellant ,"Although maybe My Lord, difficult for me to make the submission at the end of a long proceedings during the jurisdiction. Jurisdiction issues are designed to be resolved speedily, as speedily as possible, and without fuss and without undue examination of the merits of the case. If, at the end of the day, in jurisdiction having been found, the Court makes no order, I quite take Lord Clarke's point that the effect may be the same from the party's point of view as if the court declined jurisdiction in the first place."
p2,00:39:16.160,00:39:27.640,Judge,"Because the test under Article 15, for example, is the best interests of the child at the time of the application. That's not at the time of first seized. Article 15 is focusing on the best interests of the child at the moment the application is made by the Court which has jurisdiction, isn't it?"
p2,00:39:38.820,00:39:45.930,Appellant ,"Yes. Well, I'm going to come onto the best interest now and how I deal with that in a moment."
p2,00:39:46.300,00:39:51.740,Judge,"That is very important, because these things have to be considered in the context, each of the other."
p2,00:39:52.320,00:40:27.840,Appellant ,"Of course, I would urge Your Lordship, with respect, to be cautious about considering Article 15 as simply equivalent to a decline of jurisdiction. It is not a decline of jurisdiction. It's a far more complex process of, as I call it, consensual transfer of jurisdiction. May I come back to best interests and how this impinges upon that in due course?"
p2,00:40:28.020,00:40:29.140,Judge,"Depends what's meant by, to hear the case. You can transfer the hearing of the whole of the case under Article 15. And that is limited. It's what's troubling me a bit about this analysis is that while it has a certain forensic attraction, I can see that, it doesn't fit terribly well with the actual restrictions in the regulation."
p2,00:40:56.910,00:40:59.950,Appellant ,"Which restrictions in particular, does Your Lordship have in mind?"
p2,00:40:59.950,00:41:16.270,Judge,"For example, restricting Article 15 to courts of another Member State. By a different analysis, you can transfer the hearing of the case to Pakistan."
p2,00:41:16.280,00:41:39.530,Appellant ,"But the whole point of Article 15 is to create a framework for a consensual transfer, and that can only operate between those who are parties to the international regulation, be it this regulation or in the equivalent provisions in the 1996 Convention. You can't tie Pakistan to Article 15 until it signs it."
p2,00:41:39.540,00:41:53.570,Judge,Could I just ask a question about Article 15? Can the State to which the case is to be transferred decline jurisdiction?
p2,00:41:53.580,00:41:58.730,Appellant ,"Yes, they can request it and they can decline it."
p2,00:41:59.710,00:42:07.510,Judge,They are invited to cooperate. Very unfortunate to go through all the process and find the Court declines.
p2,00:42:07.510,00:42:17.430,Appellant ,"Yes, I'll see if I can find an authority on Article 15. There is one."
p2,00:42:17.900,00:42:48.520,Judge,"I suppose they can decline it. Well, they would have to consider how that is done with the doctrine of mutual trust. It seems to me that it is well known under one of the principles which we all know underpins these provisions is the doctrine of mutual trust. So if you have a court which has the jurisdiction, namely say, the United Kingdom Court, requesting another court to hear the case, then I'm not sure, absent some very surprising circumstances, surely the doctrine of mutual trust would require the receiving State to hear it."
p2,00:42:49.600,00:42:51.380,Appellant ,"Well, if we just look at --"
p2,00:42:51.840,00:42:53.890,Judge,15 (4) deals with that.
p2,00:42:53.900,00:44:41.110,Appellant ,"It does. I was going to go through Article 15 as it clearly is of interest. By way of exception, I underline that, where the Courts Member State having jurisdiction, so it's after jurisdiction is established, as to the substance of a matter, may, if they consider that a Court of another Member State with which the court has a particular connection, I'm underlining words which may be of interest to have a longer discussion about this, will be at a better place to hear the case, or a specific part thereof, and where this is in the best interest of the child, stay the case or the part thereof, and invite the parties to introduce a request or request a court of another Member State to assume jurisdiction according to paragraph 5. Paragraph 1 should apply upon the application from a party or if the courts are in motion, or upon the application from a court of another Member State with which the child has a particular connection in accordance with paragraph 3. A transfer made of the Court's own motion or the application of a court of a Member State must be accepted by at least one of the parties, so you can't do it if all the parties are against. The child shall be considered to have a particular connection, if -- there is a list of five factors in three. Four, the court of a Member State, having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter shall set a time limit by which the courts of that other Member State shall be seized in accordance with paragraph 1. If the courts are not seized by that time, the court which has been seized shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. In other words, if they refused the request or don't comply with the time limit, then the Court, the requesting Court, shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in the Court, 8 to 14. The courts of that other Member State may, due to the circumstance of the case, that this is in the best interests of the child, accept within six weeks of their seizure in accordance with paragraphs 1 (a) or (b). In this case, the Court first seized shall decline jurisdiction. Otherwise, the court first seized shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14. The courts shall cooperate for the purposes of the Article. That's, in my submission, quite a complex framework for what I call consensual transfer from one court to another. It follows on, but in greater detail, the provisions of Article 10 of the 96 Convention to which which we looked at earlier. It's not the same as the English Court saying, I don't think this court is the best court. I'm going to stay the proceedings on the assumption the proceedings will be transferred to a non Member State."
p2,00:45:46.110,00:46:16.400,Judge,"I think another way of putting that, actually is that the whole structure of Article 15 doesn't contemplate once and for all non reviewable decision. It's a provisional decision, and the final view as to whether or not it should be transferred will depend, among other things, on the reaction of the Court to which it is proposed to be transferred and therefore can be distinguished between the Court in this jurisdiction declining jurisdiction."
p2,00:46:17.280,00:46:24.210,Appellant ,"Yes, My Lord, that's a far clearer way of putting it than I was able to achieve."
p2,00:46:24.260,00:46:56.800,Judge,"It is an interesting example of the usage of the word seizure in the fourth line of paragraph 5 of Article 15. If you if you cross refer to paragraph 1 (a) and 1 (b), what amounts to seizure is either the request under (a) or the invitation which leads to a request under (a) or the request under (b). It's a single act, really, in each case, and that rather supports what you were saying about seizure and we were looking at 12 (3)."
p2,00:46:57.580,00:47:02.410,Appellant ,"Yes and in addition, Article 16."
p2,00:47:03.880,00:47:21.260,Judge,I was going to ask about Article 16. Does that help us about what is meant by a court being seized? Given that it obviously refers to a date when proceedings are instituted.
p2,00:47:22.180,00:47:42.210,Appellant ,"Yes. Although I don't, My Lady, think that it would entirely knock out the alternative interpretation, but it certainly demonstrates that in the context of regulation, the focus is normally on establishing a point at which the Court is seized."
p2,00:47:42.250,00:48:29.080,Judge,"Could I ask you, what do you understand the effect of the first respondents argument to be on decisions taken by a court before the dispute about jurisdiction is raised? Let's suppose a case which has progressed through various stages, various orders have been made. No dispute about jurisdiction has been raised. But ultimately, a party, let's take the example of a party introduced the proceedings, objects to jurisdiction. What do you understand the effect of the first respondents argument to be if it is the case that that can rob the court of jurisdiction? Does it invalidate the early orders?"
p2,00:48:29.970,00:48:30.590,Appellant ,"Well, that [inaudible], but --"
p2,00:48:34.070,00:48:36.490,Judge,That would be an interesting consequence in this case. [Inaudible].
p2,00:48:49.740,00:49:11.000,Appellant ,"Anyway, Mr Devereux reminds me to refer to the decision in Bush v Bush. Paragraph 65 and 66, I set out some passages from the judgment of Lord Justice Thorpe and the judgment of Lord Collins."
p2,00:49:11.670,00:49:12.590,Judge,Yes.
p2,00:49:13.410,00:49:25.650,Appellant ,And the italicised sections may indicate that a specific point is being considered.
p2,00:49:25.650,00:49:35.270,Judge,"Thus reflects that seizing in all these European instruments, means the initial assumption of jurisdiction by the court."
p2,00:49:35.670,00:49:41.520,Judge,"There are quite a lot of cases in the civil area, more generally, on that very point."
p2,00:49:41.530,00:49:42.310,Appellant ,Yes.
p2,00:49:43.370,00:49:52.850,Judge,I was thinking about Lugano Convention case. It was all about who got there first and how you defined what was meant by service.
p2,00:49:53.310,00:49:57.080,Appellant ,"Of course, who got there first is usually why this point arises."
p2,00:49:57.570,00:49:57.990,Judge,That's right.
p2,00:49:59.770,00:50:02.980,Appellant ,"Yes. Anyway, My Lord, have I said enough about, at the time the Court is seizing? Can I move to unequivocal acceptance?"
p2,00:50:08.060,00:50:13.420,Judge,"I think you can. Thank you. So we're moving to, in your case, to paragraph 71."
p2,00:50:13.430,00:50:50.190,Appellant ,"That's right. And Article 12 (3) requires that the jurisdiction has been accepted expressly or otherwise, by all the parties to the proceedings. Can I turn to the report in Bush v Bush, which is at tab 25? Because I want to quote the whole of the relevant passage of the Lord Collins' judgment. Tab 25 in authorities Volume 2."
p2,00:50:51.160,00:50:54.200,Judge,I think it was 26.
p2,00:50:54.200,00:51:02.690,Appellant ,"26. Sorry. Now this was a case involving Spain. And I don't think we need to look at the facts. It's the interpretation of this part of the regulation which concerns us, and I do want to concentrate on"
p2,00:51:20.810,00:53:49.170,Appellant ,"Lord Collins's -- Lord Justice Lawrence's, at paragraph 53 on page 11. It is plain that Article 12 (1) (b) of Brussels II Revised when it speaks to the jurisdiction being quote, except expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner at the time the court is seized is not simply referring to a mere submission in matrimonial proceedings equivalent to what would be an entry of appearance under Brussels I Article 24. First, it is clear that it does not refer to acceptance of the jurisdiction to enrage the matrimonial proceedings alone. It must refer to jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. Second, the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner. This must mean that accepting the jurisdiction of a court, other than that of a child's habitual residence, is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be [inaudible] by the parties at the time the proceedings are instituted. And then Your Lordship proceeded to recite the [inaudible] 12 to the regulation in paragraph 54. The first point, My Lord, we need to consider here, because in that case, the case turned on whether acknowledging the service effectively or whether the filing of a statement of arrangements in divorce proceedings amounted to consent. The court held not. The point I want to concentrate on is the emphasis on the acceptance of jurisdiction expressly or in an unequivocal manner, this must mean that acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court other than that of the child's habitual residence is not likely to be inferred and that the paradigm case will be attributed by the parent at the time the proceedings are instituted. Now, My Lord, the paradigm case is clearly agreement, and it's absolutely right of course, as Your Lordship observed, it will not likely be inferred in the absence of such express agreement. But in my submission, it is open to the parties in certain circumstances which we say apply here, to indicate through their conduct that they have unequivocally accepted jurisdiction. But that conduct must be clear in our submission, such conduct has been demonstrated by the father in this case."
p2,00:53:49.180,00:53:52.070,Judge,"By acting's. By acting, you would say?"
p2,00:53:52.550,00:53:53.260,Appellant ,By acting?
p2,00:53:53.270,00:54:16.970,Judge,"Yes, agreement can be demonstrated either by an express exchange of documents, let us say, which may be suitable in some cases. But in other cases you can infer agreement from the way parties have behaved. And it does, as we all know, it does sometimes give rise to problems. If somebody wants to oppose proceedings on the ground that there is no jurisdiction. He's got to come before the Court to do that. But one has got to be careful how you actually proceed if you proceed quite a way into the case without taking point, then it may be said, Well, it's far too late. You can't take this point at that stage. It should have been done at the outset, but that's why, if it is to be constituted by acting's, you've got to look rather carefully at what the parties have actually done to see whether that agreement can be inferred."
p2,00:54:45.940,00:54:55.630,Appellant ,"Quite so, My Lord. We list in Paragraph 73 in summary, five of the Acts that we rely on as far as the father is concerned."
p2,00:54:55.630,00:55:09.060,Judge,Is it legitimate to take into account his much earlier application for permission to remove the child from the jurisdiction as throwing light on what he was doing in 2007?
p2,00:55:09.540,00:55:51.450,Appellant ,"In my submission, it is, and in particular, the undertaking that he gave to return the child. And the context is, what difference there might be in enforcing the undertaking, that is, the context is that he was allowed to remove the child and promised to return the child. And it's worth just looking at the terms of that undertaking. Going back to Mr Justice had his order, which is in a slightly unusual place in the Court's bundle, page 27? Is it tab 7? That's the earlier one. Forgive us just a moment."
p2,00:56:07.620,00:56:08.810,Judge,Do you mean the order --
p2,00:56:09.510,00:56:11.850,Appellant ,The order giving permission to remove him from the jurisdiction.
p2,00:56:11.850,00:56:15.110,Judge,That was at tab 25 of Appendix 2.
p2,00:56:15.120,00:56:15.650,Appellant ,Thank you. I'm sorry.
p2,00:56:17.130,00:56:22.460,Judge,"Yes, it was as early as that. So we were back in 2004."
p2,00:56:23.130,00:56:38.050,Appellant ,"Yes, when given permission to remove the child from jurisdiction, he gave the undertaker a return [inaudible] when ordered to do so by this Court."
p2,00:56:38.050,00:56:39.570,Judge,I'm so sorry. Which tab is it?
p2,00:56:40.030,00:56:42.720,Appellant ,25. In the large Appendix.
p2,00:56:43.370,00:56:43.680,Judge,Thank you.
p2,00:56:45.730,00:56:55.660,Judge,"Essentially, you say he was throughout, he showed that he was accepting the jurisdiction of the English court to deal with matters of parental responsibility."
p2,00:56:56.430,00:58:06.240,Appellant ,"Yes. Certainly as far as contracts -- why should I restrict it to contracts. But it's not restricted to contract, but to parental responsibility as a whole. And nor is it confined to the proceedings that would then extend 2004 proceedings. It's when ordered to do so by this court. And that's the context in which you consider the subsequent behaviour which in particular, those matters were summarised in paragraph 73. Now I fully accept that one has to be cautious about looking at these in isolation and perhaps particularly has to be cautious about acts of a litigant in person. But nonetheless, a litigant in person is a litigant, and he attended and participated at the hearing, what we call the conciliation hearing before the deputy district judge, which resulted in the detailed and defined contact order on the 12th of December 2007. He participated in the two day hearing before Mr Justice Headley, which resulted in the detailed defined contact order that we've seen earlier today."
p2,00:58:06.290,00:58:15.120,Judge,"That was his own application, wasn't it? Am I not right? I mean, he was asking -- sorry, I beg your pardon, participating later on, he asked for that order to be set aside."
p2,00:58:15.120,00:58:19.440,Appellant ,"Exactly. He subsequently submitted an application to have that set aside. And then the position statements which we looked at earlier, which he says, the court has retained jurisdiction and the father accepts the court's jurisdiction. Although adding a rider about the enforceability of any orders made. Now in our submission, contrary to the -- with respect to Lord Justice Thorpe's analysis -- Lord Justice Thorpe said when the judge individually or cumulatively, I'm quite unpersuaded anything the father has done within this jurisdiction amounts to an unequivocal acceptance. It's our submission, we don't invite the courts to look at the Acts individually, but to look at them cumulatively in the context of the undertaking given in 2004. And we submit that it is manifestly unequivocal acceptance. It's only very, very late in the day that he seeks to challenge jurisdiction. Prior to doing so, he's given an undertaking to the Court to return the child to the Court, if ordered to do so by the Court. He submitted to at least two defined contact orders. His father position statement saying, I accept the court has jurisdiction, and he's made an application to the court himself."
p2,00:59:46.220,01:00:06.140,Judge,"If one focuses on the unequivocal nature of the acceptance, is it arguable that if he misapprehended that he had no alternative to submit to the jurisdiction, that that might have something to say on the question of whether it was unequivocal?"
p2,01:00:07.810,01:00:29.220,Appellant ,"Well in my submission, no. The question is, do you want this court to deal with this issue? Not, do you want this court to deal with this issue under this regulation or under that Act? Do you want me, the judge, to decide the issue about the future of your children?"
p2,01:00:29.420,01:00:32.820,Judge,It's irrelevant that he believes he has no alternative at that time.
p2,01:00:34.610,01:00:45.220,Appellant ,It would be irrelevant if he believes he has no alternative. But how can one seek to establish whether that's the case or not? Ignorance of the law is no excuse.
p2,01:00:45.220,01:00:46.240,Judge,"Well, yes."
p2,01:00:46.610,01:00:52.020,Judge,The position statement of the 2nd of March?
p2,01:00:53.210,01:00:53.740,Appellant ,Yes.
p2,01:00:54.110,01:00:59.100,Judge,Looks pretty clear.
p2,01:00:59.250,01:00:59.730,Appellant ,Yes.
p2,01:01:01.110,01:01:06.560,Judge,And presumably is not being drafted without authority.
p2,01:01:06.880,01:01:07.560,Appellant ,Well --
p2,01:01:07.560,01:01:21.080,Judge,"I would have said, very eminently respectable counsel who was perfectly well aware of the law, unable therefore, to give him advice about it. This is tab 20."
p2,01:01:24.490,01:01:25.440,Appellant ,In the same bubble.
p2,01:01:27.510,01:01:42.730,Judge,"Yes. I'm not saying that this arises in the present case at all. It's just that in my mind I'm asking myself, is it conceivable that it might be relevant that someone mistakenly believed he had no alternative?"
p2,01:01:43.810,01:01:58.940,Appellant ,"Well, obviously it is possible that he may have had that belief and he may be mistaken in that belief. Why should it, though, My Lord, affect the outcome?"
p2,01:02:00.400,01:02:05.110,Judge,"Well, I think that one can immediately think of countervailing arguments because the opponent has committed herself or himself to the adjudication of the court."
p2,01:02:12.760,01:02:15.150,Appellant ,"And in this case, we're looking at the child's welfare."
p2,01:02:15.170,01:02:15.930,Judge,"Yes, indeed."
p2,01:02:18.080,01:03:23.320,Appellant ,"Several years on into the proceedings. This point was considered, actually, My Lord, by Mr Justice Hedley in another case, the case of C v C, which is at tab 25 in the authority. So in my copy, that's volume two of the authority, tab 25. It is reported somewhere that we've got the [inaudible] report, and this is about a case in which a mother had been given permission to remove a child to Spain. A lot of the cases involve Spain. And the father subsequently brought further proceedings in England for contact with the child. Paragraph 12, the father's counsel says this. He says at all times, up to a letter, last summer, the mother fully participated in the proceedings. At all material times she was representative, took no issue on jurisdiction, even though the children must have been habitually resident in Spain for many months. It is true that the wording is in an unequivocal manner at the time the Court is seized. That cannot, he contends, be narrowly construed since at the time of being seized, the issue of an application, a respondent may well have no knowledge of the matter. He submits to the court, absent express acceptance and has agreed that there is none here. Must look at the litigation, conduct and draw inferences from it. He estimated there is only one inference here, and that is now too late to object to jurisdiction of this current matter. Paragraph 16, halfway down the page, halfway down the paragraph, line seven, given that Miss Harding cannot challenge the fact on the mother's participation in the proceeding, she's for the mother, including an application whilst acting in person for an extension of time, the question can be further refined, and I think this is My Lord's point, can the mother be said to have accepted jurisdiction in an unequivocal map if she had never appreciated that it was able to challenge. It is that question that I'm required to answer. It would be unreal to think that the question of jurisdiction has never occurred to anyone. And I interject that in this case we know that it had. That said, however, I do accept Miss Harding's submission that no one ever saw it as a problem, and thus the mother did not specifically address in her mind an objection to it. In my judgement, the fundamental approach to this should be, what inference should be drawn from the mother's litigation conduct? The answer to that is clear. Complete acceptance. Then one should ask whether a failure to address the question of challenge vitiates what otherwise appears to be an unequivocal acceptance. I do not think it does. This case demonstrates a clear acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction at least until late 2006, by which time, at any [inaudible] the court must be seized with the matter. Accordingly, it is then too late to object. In my judgement, the evidence demonstrates unequivocal participation in the proceedings and thus an acceptance of the jurisdiction. I do not think that the absence, as I'm prepared to accept it was, of advice on her right to object should vitiate the unequivocal acceptance otherwise is damaged. I'm glad to reach that view in this case, as questions of jurisdiction should be resolved at the outset of the case are not on the eve of the final hearing. That point of policy also fortifies my view that the court should be looking at what the partners have actually done, rather than the reasons or lack of them for doing it absent, of course, for misrepresentation. So that's the view of an extremely experienced judgement at first instance, addresses the very point Your Lordship was making."
p2,01:06:15.870,01:06:39.500,Judge,"A principle underpinned by a good whiff of pragmatism. Because if you permit someone to assert late in the day that they didn't address the question of jurisdiction, you invite someone who sees the way the wind is blowing to come up with a specious point."
p2,01:06:40.380,01:06:43.660,Appellant ,"May I then turn, My Lord, to --"
p2,01:06:43.680,01:06:52.230,Judge,"Presumably, that would be subject to the doctrine of negligent or misrepresentation or fraudulent misrepresentation, or something like that."
p2,01:06:52.720,01:06:54.180,Appellant ,"Indeed, as Mr Justice Hedley makes clear."
p2,01:06:55.150,01:07:09.570,Judge,"That could arise in the case of an express acceptance. You could say, Sorry, I agreed to this, but I was completely misled and ask for that agreement, that express agreement, to be set aside. So there has to be that modification of the thing it's not so tight it doesn't accept that kind of error."
p2,01:07:09.930,01:07:10.650,Appellant ,It would not then presumably be unequivocal. That's right. It doesn't arise in this case.
p2,01:07:14.650,01:07:15.580,Judge,"In this case, we don't have [crosstalk] --"
p2,01:07:16.210,01:07:19.300,Appellant ,"Can I assess the court further on that point? If not, I'll move to best interest of the child."
p2,01:07:21.980,01:07:22.600,Judge,Thank you.
p2,01:07:23.580,01:07:37.800,Appellant ,"Now here, can I just go back to the regulation itself, Tab 1. So, 12 (3) (b)."
p2,01:07:40.220,01:07:42.970,Judge,Is there any difference between the superior interests and best interest?
p2,01:07:43.460,01:08:00.810,Appellant ,"No. I understand that in some translations, the same word is used. There is authority, which I don't have my fingertips, to indicate that they are intended to mean the same. It's in the practise guide."
p2,01:08:00.990,01:08:03.830,Judge,French and Italians say superior.
p2,01:08:04.670,01:08:14.590,Appellant ,"Meaning both, both points. Lord Clarke's point is that it's superior in 1, 12 (1), and best in 12 --"
p2,01:08:14.600,01:08:15.640,Judge,In the English language.
p2,01:08:18.470,01:08:24.310,Judge,In Italian it's superior in 12 (3) and in the French.
p2,01:08:24.310,01:08:33.069,Appellant ,"I've always wondered, My Lord, perhaps can I ask you, which language do they use first and where do we start? Or is it all simultaneous?"
p2,01:08:35.160,01:08:39.180,Judge,"Well, they're all equally authoritative, but I'm not sure. I imagine it was drafted in French."
p2,01:08:40.560,01:08:43.330,Appellant ,French. So moving --
p2,01:08:43.330,01:08:47.890,Judge,"Superior sounds much more like our concept of the paramount interests of the child. The best is talking about the difference between two or more alternative solutions, whereas superior or paramount is saying, This is an overriding consideration, the interests of the child."
p2,01:09:01.250,01:09:23.560,Appellant ,"It would definitely be possible to distinguish, to mount an argument, they're being different things. But as I understand it, there's authority that they don't, I don't have it at my fingertips. Only the German. And as Lord Collins has said, the same word is apparently used in other transitions. Why they couldn't have done this --"
p2,01:09:23.560,01:09:31.270,Judge,I think what we haven't quite worked out is whether superior used in little (b)? It is. Thank you.
p2,01:09:31.270,01:10:11.980,Appellant ,"Why? Goodness knows. Then moving to the point I want to make about 12 (3) initially is to acknowledge the syntax point, namely, that the phrase reads, the jurisdiction of the court has been accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to proceedings at the time the court is seized and is in the best interests of the child. So the phrase, and is in the best interests of the child, in the sentence, in the clause, comes after the phrase, at the time the court is seized. It's my submission --"
p2,01:10:11.990,01:10:15.320,Judge,It's the jurisdiction which has to be in the best interests of the child?
p2,01:10:15.330,01:10:34.060,Appellant ,"Yes, in my submission, the only reasonable and practical construction is that that falls to be considered at the time the court is seized, i.e. at the outset of the proceedings, and it's not something which falls to be considered at all points during the course of the proceedings. The reason for that is the purposive argument that the purpose of Article 12 is to enable the court to determine whether it has jurisdiction and in my submission, it would be manifestly unworkable if the court were required, the instance of any party to review the question whether it still has jurisdiction at all stages of the proceedings. Either the court has jurisdiction or it does not."
p2,01:10:58.580,01:11:14.660,Judge,"Not least because the court has a personal responsibility, as you've demonstrated earlier. Yes, so the consequence of the argument being accepted, that the court would, of its own motion have to review the question of whether or not it remained in the interest of the child."
p2,01:11:14.660,01:12:29.440,Appellant ,"At every time. And of course it is, My Lord Clarke was quite right to remind me, the jurisdiction of the courts. The jurisdiction is in the best interests of the child. But that is very close to asking the welfare question, and it cannot be right in my submission at all points for the court to consider the welfare question in order to determine whether it has jurisdiction, since the point of establishing jurisdiction is to carry out the welfare exercise. In this case, of course, we're dealing with a country that isn't Pakistan that is not a signatory to the Hague Convention, and consequently, 12 (4) comes into play, and here we move into an element of some uncharted waters, an interpretation which we put forward without authority for discussion. This contains a deeming provision, where the child has habitual residence in the territory of a third state, which is not a contracting party of the Hague Convention, jurisdiction under this Article shall be deemed to be in the child's interest."
p2,01:12:29.450,01:12:42.900,Judge,May I take you up on your description of this as a deeming provision? It isn't. Deemed is clearly by reference to the other language versions meant it. It simply means presumed.
p2,01:12:43.030,01:12:55.410,Appellant ,"Well, I'm glad that you correct me in that way, My Lord. I stand corrected. But as you would have seen, the waters are not as uncharted as I anticipated, because that is what we had deduced."
p2,01:12:55.660,01:12:59.260,Judge,Otherwise it would make no sense at all.
p2,01:13:00.350,01:13:07.360,Appellant ,"Well, My Lord, the interpreter, I'm happy to hear that's the meaning in other languages, because that's what we invite the court to say."
p2,01:13:07.370,01:13:09.110,Judge,That's really what you're saying in your case [crosstalk].
p2,01:13:09.380,01:13:47.410,Appellant ,"Our case is that it is a presumption. The question is, which there's help from other jurisdictions on this point. What does it mean? We ask the question, what does it mean where it says at the end of Article 12 (4), measures jurisdiction in this article shall be deemed to be in the child's interests, particularly if it is found impossible to hold proceeds in the third state in question. The suggestion we put forward is that there is a presumption that the child is habitually resident in the third state and that it is irrebuttable --"
p2,01:13:47.410,01:13:48.360,Judge,Or particularly strong.
p2,01:13:48.370,01:13:59.880,Appellant ,"Or particularly strong. We would submit it must be very strong, if not irrebuttable, if it's impossible to hold proceedings."
p2,01:14:00.650,01:14:09.170,Judge,"That's if you're influenced by the word deemed. But if it does mean simply presumed, then it just becomes a very strong element."
p2,01:14:11.340,01:14:22.730,Judge,"Well, it cant be a deemed provision if it identifies a particular factor. It's a deemed provision, then that consequence flows. You don't have to identify a particular factor."
p2,01:14:22.810,01:14:43.210,Appellant ,"Yes, well, it's our view that would be manifestly unfair. So the submission we were putting to the court was that it should be presumed. If that's the word used in other versions, then no doubt that's something which this court would want to make absolutely clear."
p2,01:14:43.210,01:14:45.550,Judge,"So what, then, does it mean?"
p2,01:14:47.380,01:14:49.910,Appellant ,"Well, there's a question of whether the absence of the word best, which my learned friend, Mr Setright points out. But we respectfully wonder whether that is of huge significance. What it means is, that where the child is habitually resident as here in a non contracting state, it is to be presumed that it is in the best interests of the child for the jurisdiction to be exercised under this Article."
p2,01:15:16.360,01:15:17.060,Judge,In where?
p2,01:15:17.710,01:15:21.950,Appellant ,In this country. Prorogation is to be presumed to be in the best interest of the child.
p2,01:15:24.340,01:15:30.920,Judge,"You're saying, the fact that you've got best at one part and not here doesn't matter, that's the obvious sense of it, you say, do you?"
p2,01:15:31.120,01:15:44.740,Appellant ,"Not if it's a rebuttable presumption. Best interests, and interests, we say there's no distinction. So the question --"
p2,01:15:44.740,01:15:49.370,Judge,This is derived from the unequivocal agreement? The presumption.
p2,01:15:50.740,01:15:55.670,Judge,"Well, not so much derived from but as a next step."
p2,01:15:57.420,01:16:19.630,Appellant ,"There are hurdles we have to get over. The first one is substantial connection. The second one is unequivocal acceptance. The third one is best interests. And in the case of a child who is habitually resident in a non contracting state, that is to be presumed."
p2,01:16:21.130,01:16:23.210,Judge,Under Article 12 (4).
p2,01:16:23.210,01:16:23.820,Appellant ,Under Article 12 (4).
p2,01:16:24.400,01:16:31.000,Judge,But still has to be the unequivocal agreement. That's the underlying basis for the presumption.
p2,01:16:31.010,01:16:34.110,Judge,"Basically, we've got people saying, We will submit to the jurisdiction here, because the reality is we have nowhere else to go."
p2,01:16:40.230,01:17:29.450,Appellant ,"Yes, I don't, in this case put it quite as strongly as that. But I do say that the presumption applies. Where does that leave us in this case? Well of course, it wasn't argued in this way before Judge Barnett. But he did conduct a very similar exercise, the forum conveniens exercise, and reached a conclusion that he would not have been persuaded to grant a stay. Thus he accepted that if he had jurisdiction, the courts of England and Wales were the correct forum for deciding the disputed matters about this little boy. In our submission, that is, that analysis of Judge Barnett's, underpins the presumption and doesn't in any way undermine it."
p2,01:17:30.430,01:17:49.890,Judge,"Subject to the point you made earlier that this is a matter of jurisdiction, that on the application, on the merits of the application, then the judge has an unfettered decision to say that it would be in the best interests of the child at the time he's considering the application, to have --"
p2,01:17:50.260,01:17:52.070,Appellant ,To make an order.
p2,01:17:52.070,01:17:54.920,Judge,To make an order that this question be determined by the courts of Pakistan.
p2,01:17:54.930,01:18:00.030,Appellant ,"No, to refuse to make an order under his jurisdiction. The impact would be the same."
p2,01:18:01.020,01:18:03.540,Judge,"Because I'm still troubled by the notion that [inaudible] I see the logic of what you have said, but there's something quite striking about the difference between [inaudible] and [inaudible] paragraph 3. And paragraph 1. Paragraph 1 is all about agreement between the spouses. Paragraph 3 is about agreement between all the parties to the proceedings and one wonders whether the European court might not say to itself, Well, that must surely include China, and there's something odd about having these strict rules about jurisdiction in circumstances where it's not unlikely generally in a case like this that the child is going to be represented, but before the child ever becomes represented, the case on jurisdiction is lost. There's something very odd about that."
p2,01:18:51.950,01:19:15.470,Appellant ,"My Lord, the first point to make is, it is by a great respect correct to say that it is, I forget the phrase Your Lordship used, highly likely. It's still relatively unusual in my experience along the road, for children to be joined as parties to private law proceedings, particularly with all the problems."
p2,01:19:16.820,01:19:17.750,Judge,We're construing a European instrument.
p2,01:19:20.520,01:19:26.740,Appellant ,Quite so. And it is right that the impact of our analysis is that --
p2,01:19:26.820,01:19:29.560,Judge,[Crosstalk] doesn't get a say on the crucial question of jurisdiction.
p2,01:19:29.870,01:19:40.060,Appellant ,"No. But she does get a say on the more important question of what order to make, and the effect which is fundamentally what she's there for. She's not there ultimately, to represent the parties --"
p2,01:19:40.780,01:19:48.650,Judge,"The best interest question may already have been decided as at the first seized. And if there's no change of circumstance between the two, it may be very difficult."
p2,01:19:53.190,01:20:00.710,Appellant ,But ultimately the jurisdiction point is only the preliminary issue. The main question for the guardian is what is in the best interests of the child.
p2,01:20:00.710,01:20:02.540,Judge,Including where should this question be determined.
p2,01:20:03.710,01:20:09.600,Appellant ,"Well, that may be a component of it. Yes."
p2,01:20:09.610,01:20:10.050,Judge,A critical component.
p2,01:20:11.010,01:20:11.980,Appellant ,Maybe.
p2,01:20:11.990,01:21:27.830,Judge,"The real question in these proceedings is, should this child come to this country to see mum, ensured that in due course, be capable of developing into unsupervised contact with the child? That is the issue to which the proceedings are directed. It's perfectly possible that a judge hearing that issue will say, for a variety of reasons, whatever my view about what would in theory be best, I think that it would be the best interests of this child if I do not make any order on that topic for a variety of reasons, it could be partly because of the difficulties of enforcement, partly because there are other proceedings going on in Pakistan or whatever. Partly because there are things that he doesn't know. There are all sorts of reasons why one might not make an order. It's not like ordinary civil proceedings where you have to decide one way or the other what the answer is. I think that's the difference between children proceedings and other proceedings. It's a different set of issues at the time than the issue about whether it's in the interest of the child for this particular court, at least to hear the case."
p2,01:21:28.810,01:21:46.540,Judge,"It wouldn't offend [inaudible] to say that, for a judge to say, It wouldn't be in the interest of child to make an order for contact with the mother because the grandparents would refuse to allow the child to leave Pakistan, and I'm entitled to take account of that."
p2,01:21:47.010,01:21:51.130,Judge,"Yes, it's important for [inaudible] to adopt a pragmatic and realistic approach. And if the subpoena succeeds, it is only going to be the beginning of the stories of mothers [inaudible]."
p2,01:22:07.200,01:22:50.230,Appellant ,"Yes. I think My Lord, Lord Collins' approach partakes of a jurisdictional overview. Although it may not be directed to that, I think, My Lord, Lord Clarke is concerned that criticism might be voiced if we shut out the child from participation in the jurisdictional issue. Your answer, I think, to that, is that in effect, that will be something that will be considered at the time when the ultimate question is addressed by the court. Is it in the best interest of the child that we should exercise the jurisdiction, or should we make no order?"
p2,01:22:50.800,01:23:04.320,Appellant ,"Exactly. When exercising jurisdiction. But practically, it is the same. May I support further question of the interest of the child?"
p2,01:23:07.800,01:23:13.500,Judge,"That, I think, leaves the policy considerations, does it?"
p2,01:23:15.400,01:23:29.620,Appellant ,"It does. And [inaudible]. First of all, the policy [inaudible] what Lord Justice Thorpe said."
p2,01:23:34.000,01:23:34.830,Judge,Tab 2.
p2,01:23:35.600,01:23:43.910,Appellant ,Tab 2.
p2,01:23:46.600,01:23:49.190,Judge,"Can I just ask you one last question based on what we've been discussing? Do you discuss the point we've just been discussing in your case? That's to say, what is permissible?"
p2,01:23:57.600,01:24:11.600,Appellant ,"I do say, that yes, paragraph 70, is the point about the guardian [inaudible]."
p2,01:24:26.490,01:24:35.180,Judge,"After what appears to be a list of concessions, you arrive at the same position on the notes, what appears to be the jurisdiction [inaudible]."
p2,01:24:35.440,01:24:43.380,Appellant ,"Well, what I said at the bottom of paragraph 70 is, part six [inaudible] exercise of discretion not to make any [inaudible] of the proceedings. I'll give the example, section 1 (5)."
p2,01:24:58.050,01:25:34.410,Judge,"I thought paragraph 76 was probably as close as you came to making the point. You're contrasting, I think, the exercise of what is in the best interest of the child at that point at which you're considering jurisdiction with what the court actually does when it carries out its assessment in the exercise of that jurisdiction. That's the contrast you've been making. But of course, I think Lord Clarke is really saying, Well, you may have sold the pass once you get jurisdiction, one of the crucial points has already gone by the time you've got jurisdiction established."
p2,01:25:36.800,01:25:56.810,Judge,"I can see that if the best interest of the child looks [inaudible], if it's the beginning that's one thing. But when it comes to the actual hearing, then you'll have a proper hearing. So maybe it's justice or well, it's a presumption, something like it. And so once you establish the agreement between the parents who may have all kinds of other axes to grind, that's one thing. When you come to loo look at the real interest of the child [inaudible]."
p2,01:25:57.290,01:25:59.910,Appellant ,Yes. There can't be [inaudible] an enormously long analysis on this point otherwise jurisdiction [inaudible].
p2,01:26:10.300,01:26:34.490,Judge,"Even longer than they already do? But you will at least have heard some evidence. Yes, on the whole, with jurisdictional arguments, evidence is not very common or it's only directed to specific aspects of jurisdiction. Whereas when you're deciding whether it's in the best interest of the child for you to make an order or not, you will have heard and seen."
p2,01:26:34.980,01:26:36.430,Judge,That may be what this court says in this case.
p2,01:26:39.880,01:26:42.690,Appellant ,"May I move to policy matters? Lord Justice Thorpe, paragraph 33 [inaudible] emphasise that prorogation [inaudible] in a huge majority of cases [inaudible] to international planning law, it takes horrendous [inaudible] save exceptional circumstances, the habitual residence of the child dictates which state holds the primary jurisdiction. Nationality [inaudible] should not alter [inaudible] from that approach. In our very considerable deviance from Pakistan, we are highly dependant upon the [inaudible] immigration law, which was signed by the senior judiciary of the two jurisdictions in January 2003. There are approximately a million British nationals of Pakistani origin in this jurisdiction. Conflicted cases between this jurisdiction and Pakistan passed through my office at the rate of approximately once a fortnight. I interject here, [inaudible] of course, as the court will know, Lord Justice [inaudible] was the head of international justice, I think that was the context in which I make the observation. In the vast majority of cases, we were pleading with the judges in Pakistan to recognise that welfare decisions belong to and are the responsibility of the courts of the child of British residence. I suggest that although the protocol is largely directed to cases of wrongful removal or retention, the principal stated in the first paragraph is of general application. In all the circumstances [inaudible] habitually resident. We can hardly expect the judges at the start to honour the protocol beyond the immediate territory of [inaudible] if we lay [inaudible] to the claim to jurisdiction in relation to children who are essentially Pakistani. Now, the Pakistan Protocol --"
p2,01:28:35.670,01:28:38.580,Judge,Why is it exorbitant if both parents have accepted?
p2,01:28:38.790,01:29:08.850,Appellant ,"Well, quite. First point. Second point, the protocol itself doesn't talk about it being the invariable, it's the normal circumstances, and that is entirely consistent with the European jurisprudence and the regulation. We tentatively raise this question. Is it appropriate for a court interpreting English law, which is what regulation is, to do so in the light of, or by having regard to the importance of a protocol signed by the judiciary of two countries. It's been observed and we've given the references in paragraph 85, there's been some concern about the legal status of the protocol. I'm not sure whether this court will want to delve too deeply into that question. We accept that the protocol plays an important part, practical role, in regulating and assisting in relations between the courts of the two countries. But it's a non legislative agreement between members of the judiciary, and should not, in our submission, be invoked to determine the construction and application of English law. The consequence would be that one group of litigants, those who are relying on Pakistani courts to respect jurisdiction based on habitual residence, are favoured of expense of other parents who wish to choose the English court under the prorogation paths in Article 12. And furthermore, we say it risks putting the courts of this country at odds with the rest of Europe, thereby defeating the principal aim of the regulation."
p2,01:30:42.760,01:30:49.480,Judge,I suppose you could say the protocol doesn't seem to have been signed by the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland [crosstalk].
p2,01:30:59.630,01:31:06.470,Judge,"I have to own that there was a delegate from Northern Ireland, but without the authority of the Lord [inaudible] [laughing]."
p2,01:31:12.160,01:31:18.480,Appellant ,I don't know to what extent the court is assisted by my developing those points or by looking at the criticism of the protocol.
p2,01:31:20.440,01:31:31.280,Judge,"Were there to be a policy choice available, which, in questions of jurisdiction, it's not necessarily the case, in fact, not likely to be the case. But were there to be a policy choice available, then the protocol and the good it brings and the negative effects upon the protocol, would be relevant to the exercise of a policy choice. One might have thought. That's a very different thing from saying that it's in the slightest bit relevant to the interpretation of what Brussels II and the Family Law Act require."
p2,01:31:52.870,01:32:00.520,Appellant ,"Precisely. That's as far as I want to go, My Lady and My Lord, unless you wish me to go further into the criticism of the protocol, I wont."
p2,01:32:00.680,01:32:06.560,Judge,Parts of it presumably would be no more than guidelines for the exercise of discretion.
p2,01:32:06.640,01:32:08.980,Appellant ,"Yes, indeed, arguably, it all is."
p2,01:32:09.650,01:32:12.800,Judge,"If it all is, then it's the old criticism."
p2,01:32:12.810,01:32:19.170,Judge,We can see the nature of it in paragraph 84 of your case. I think you quote paragraph 1.
p2,01:32:23.350,01:32:39.580,Appellant ,"Of course, all the court will probably know more than I, there are a large number of them, I imagine, of agreements of this sort and odd agreements between member states and other countries, some, I don't know whether there are any other examples of judicial --"
p2,01:32:41.160,01:32:50.440,Judge,"There are some other ones, or one other, at least, it's a bit like this, or at least one other is in the offing that's a bit like this. But this is not an interstate agreement."
p2,01:32:50.610,01:32:51.470,Judge,No.
p2,01:32:51.470,01:32:52.370,Judge,It's not a treaty.
p2,01:32:52.410,01:32:53.910,Judge,"It's aspirational, really, isn't it?"
p2,01:32:53.920,01:33:43.090,Appellant ,"It is. Does the court, can I ask whether this is something that should affected in any way by the very recent convention, to which my learned friend Russell alludes, the 2009 convention? Is it something which this country should be reconsidering in the light of the obligations under that convention? Not for me to ask the question? Anyway, My Lord, I've the point as far as I wanted. It's quite clear with respect to Lord Justice Thorpe, that the impact of the protocol was something which featured strongly in the mind of the Court of Appeal in adopting a narrow construction of Brussels II revised. In my submission, it was inappropriate. Now, unless  there's anything else I can say to convince the court on that topic, the last topic in our cases, this forum non conveniens."
p2,01:33:44.050,01:34:07.230,Judge,"I noted that in Miss Russell's case, paragraph 25, she said she would not raise. I hope I've got this right. She would not raise the -- this is a primary argument. I'm not quite sure what's left of it, but I get the impression she doesn't put that as a very strong point in her favour."
p2,01:34:07.240,01:34:08.270,Appellant ,"No, she doesn't."
p2,01:34:09.660,01:34:14.150,Appellant ,Can I ask the court to consider this question? If it's not taken today in this case --
p2,01:34:14.160,01:34:27.330,Judge,"I think it's right to say she hasn't abandoned it. But it's put in that way in paragraph 25, just to show that it's not the primary argument and that's some kind of a notice to us as to the importance of the issue."
p2,01:34:27.430,01:34:33.800,Appellant ,"Were it not to be raised today in this court, it could undoubtedly be raised at some future stage in this or any other proceedings."
p2,01:34:33.800,01:34:34.990,Judge,Yes.
p2,01:34:34.990,01:35:04.530,Appellant ,"And it is a question which the court may feel needs to be addressed, does the Owusu principle extend over to Brussels II Revised? Of course, it doesn't arise in this case, strictly, because a judge, Judge Barnett, ruled on a previous occasion that forum non conveniens, that he would not stay the proceedings, were he to have jurisdiction. It doesn't strictly speaking, my first point, I suppose, is I rely on his decision."
p2,01:35:05.880,01:35:10.460,Judge,"I suppose that's making no order [inaudible] it isn't such a daft point, there's a lot of confusion of thought. I cant remember without looking at Owusu whether it's about staying proceedings or declining jurisdiction. I always thought if you were making an application on the basis of forum non conveniens, in litigation, generally, you were accepting the jurisdiction of the court. But you're saying that it shouldn't be exercised for this, that, or the other reason. And I'm a little concerned myself that the principles in a Owusu might be used in some future case in the ECJ in relation to the substantive questions we were discussing earlier. I am fixated by that, but I'm concerned about it and looking at your [inaudible] the difference between staying on the grounds of forum non conveniens and declining jurisdiction on those grounds is, if I may respectfully say so, fudged."
p2,01:36:00.080,01:36:01.140,Appellant ,Fudged. Yes.
p2,01:36:01.400,01:36:05.960,Judge,"I'm not inviting you particularly to go and think about it, but there are some potential problems there."
p2,01:36:06.330,01:36:27.930,Judge,"I've always thought of them as separate issues. In the forum non conveniens is Scottish concept, and if you're taking the point, it's regarded as a quite separate point from a plea of no jurisdiction. So, in effect, if you're going to argue that point, you've conceded the jurisdiction point and you're now discussing whether the court with jurisdiction should send the case elsewhere."
p2,01:36:29.050,01:36:29.620,Appellant ,Yes.
p2,01:36:29.880,01:36:30.840,Judge,That's the theory.
p2,01:36:31.430,01:36:37.460,Judge,"What I'm not quite sure is whether Owusu, it -- analyse isn't quite the right word."
p2,01:36:37.930,01:36:38.760,Appellant ,"Well, to look at it, to answer that question, we'd have to look at Owusu."
p2,01:36:42.260,01:36:43.890,Judge,Owusu was a stay case and it was not legitimate to decline to exercise jurisdiction on jurisdictional grounds.
p2,01:36:54.130,01:37:00.860,Appellant ,"In brief, my point, you have my points about the impact of Owusu in the written case."
p2,01:37:01.730,01:37:23.760,Judge,"One line, you don't mention a written case, but we are aware of from experience in the House of Lords is the issue about arbitration proceedings. If you have an agreement which you wish to give effect to which conflicts with the Brussels rules, I think the Court of Justice has ruled that you can't do that. The Brussels rules are mandatory."
p2,01:37:23.770,01:37:24.460,Appellant ,Yes.
p2,01:37:24.830,01:37:43.050,Judge,"And it just emphasises the importance of that doctrine. But it also illustrates the wide ranging effect it has. And for myself, I would be rather reluctant to get too deeply into this in a case where it doesn't actually arise, unless I'm persuaded that we need to decide it in this."
p2,01:37:43.770,01:37:45.650,Appellant ,My point is similar in that it is likely to arise.
p2,01:37:46.330,01:37:47.900,Judge,But not in this case.
p2,01:37:47.900,01:37:51.450,Appellant ,"It doesn't arise in this case, and this again comes back to how this court now sees its role."
p2,01:37:51.450,01:37:52.380,Judge,"It would need a reference, really, wouldn't it?"
p2,01:37:55.030,01:37:57.060,Appellant ,"Well, quite a [cross talk] was quite a rejoinder from the European court in Owusu about -- my submission is --"
p2,01:38:05.370,01:38:06.510,Judge,It's quite a different context.
p2,01:38:07.710,01:38:45.900,Appellant ,"It is a different context. My submission there is clear that the mandatory language is the same, so it is clearly applicable by analogy. We read again, My Lord, to bring up another case, [inaudible] asserts that it's very unpopular, that it has problems. I don't know to what extent that is, you share within membership of this court. Nonetheless, there is concern at the bar that this problem is going to rise sooner or later, given the difficulty getting this far, and given the importance of the Supreme Court establishing guidance where legitimately possible, we raise it for consideration if the court wishes to develop those arguments."
p2,01:38:46.180,01:38:58.640,Judge,"You've covered it very thoroughly in the concluding paragraphs of your case. And I don't know, unless anybody has any further points to raise, we need any more oral argument on the point. Do you content to that?"
p2,01:38:59.620,01:39:03.980,Appellant ,"Can I assist the court further? There is the question of habitual residence, which Mr Devereux is going to deal with."
p2,01:39:03.990,01:39:10.870,Judge,"Well, we've decided we don't need to be addressed on habitual residence. If that's any comfort, Mr Devereaux."
p2,01:39:10.880,01:39:14.390,Appellant ,I think disappointment.
p2,01:39:15.530,01:39:16.820,Judge,He's done a lot of work on it I'm sure.
p2,01:39:17.380,01:39:18.360,Appellant ,Can I assist the court further at this stage?
p2,01:39:18.360,01:39:23.760,Judge,Thank you very much indeed. Mr Devereaux.
p2,01:39:18.360,01:39:23.760,Appellant ,"My Lord, a great comfort and disappointment as well."
p2,01:39:18.360,01:39:23.760,Judge,Thank you very much. Miss Russel?
p2,01:39:29.120,01:40:05.230,Respondent ,"Thank you, My Lord. My Lord, if I may, first return to the matter of Article 12 (4) in particular, and the term third state. And it is our strong contention that third state within the context of Brussels II Revised refers to states within Member States, within the European Union, who are non contracting members, non contracting states to the Hague Convention."
p2,01:40:07.310,01:40:08.620,Judge,Not parties to the Hague.
p2,01:40:10.810,01:40:59.370,Respondent ,"And it is within that context that they are described as third states. And I've set out, I think, briefly in our case, some of the reasons why we say that. But if we look at the regulations themselves regarding the two points where third state is mentioned and also looking again at the Articles referring to third states, the first one is, of course, and the first mention is at 12 (4), and you could say that the meaning there is where the child has his or her habitual residence in the territory or the state which is not a contracting party to the Hague Convention, then the indication is that it is presumed to be in the child's interest, particularly if it's not possible to hold proceedings in that member state to hold proceedings in the state that the parties have agreed upon. And I will return to the matter of agreement later. If one also considers Article 61, which deals with relations with the Hague Convention of October 1996, at (b) of that particular Article, it refers to the recognition and enforcement of the judgment given at the court of the Member State and at the territory of another Member State, even if the child concerned has his or her habitual residence on the territory of a third state, which is a contracting party to the convention. And then we would say that the question of the definition of third state has to be seen within the context of the convention as a whole. And when one considers the convention as a whole, the preamble and the guidance, which I will again return to, it's clear the objective is to create an area within the community itself to allow freedom of movement of persons, including to adopt the judicial cooperation in civil matters and the proper functioning of the internal market. So that is the context of this. And Lord Collins referred to the fact that third state could be seen, perhaps in the same way that one might refer to a third party. But if one looks at the council regulation in that way, it would be most unusual. We would submit if one was, for example, looking at contract and third parties in contract, the third party would be bound by a contract that they were not party to in the sense they had had nothing to do was creating the contract or taking on board any of the obligations of that contract. And overall, the thrust of our argument is really that it would be or a step too far for the European community to assume, whether by agreement or whether not by the agreement of the parents to assume jurisdiction over children who are lawfully resident in non Member States. And as an illustration, of course, in this case, we're considering a child that's habitually resident now in Pakistan, but as an illustration, one can imagine the reaction of other states perhaps, for example, the United States or the Russian Republic, to the idea that the European Union countries were claiming that they had primary jurisdiction again, I say, whether by agreement or not over a child that was lawfully resident in their country. And that is, if I can say so, My Lords and My Lady, the main thrust of our objection to that definition of third state, and we say that that is supported by, for example, the guidance to Brussels II Revised."
p2,01:45:07.730,01:45:23.620,Judge,"before you get to that, in Article 61, what do the last few words about habitual residence on the territory of the third stage of contracting party to the Hague Convention, what do they add? If you're right."
p2,01:45:28.290,01:45:54.300,Respondent ,"Well, what we are saying there is that the third country is the country that the child is living in. It's a country that is a Member State. It is a contracting party to the Convention. But the other states are non contracting, and that's the assumption of that particular Article."
p2,01:45:55.890,01:46:05.100,Judge,"But if it refers to a Member State, then all you need is (a) don't you?"
p2,01:46:05.880,01:46:31.210,Respondent ,"Yes, one can see that argument, My Lord. But the fact of the matter is that there are numerous references to Member States throughout capital M and capital S, and we say that this is just to differentiate between the other states that are being described in the earlier part of that paragraph. And it's as simple as that. And no more complicated than that."
p2,01:46:31.480,01:46:34.370,Judge,"Is there anything in the preamble that helps us at all? We get in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the preamble, the general background, which I think is that because one's talking about, or one's envisaging an area of freedom, security and justice, there should be common rules --"
p2,01:46:50.680,01:46:52.720,Respondent ,"There is nothing, sorry to interrupt you, My Lord, but there is nothing that even indicates, we would say in the preamble, that this regulation could be said to apply to non Member States."
p2,01:47:08.880,01:47:13.880,Judge,"You've got 12, which talks generally about the grounds of jurisdiction."
p2,01:47:13.890,01:47:16.560,Respondent ,"Yes, again, that --"
p2,01:47:16.560,01:47:51.870,Judge,"That talks about Member States, but I don't think there's anything that actually goes outside Member States in the general discussion, but that may be understandable because the whole point of this particular measure is that it's, in effect, part of the treaty obligations between Member States in relation to each other. And is setting a common standard, which all of them undertake to observe in all matters relating to parental responsibility. And that means that when you get to, for example, bits in the preamble about mutual recognition. Indeed, paragraph 2. You can do that because you've all been working to the same basic rules on jurisdiction, and therefore it's reasonable that if an order is made by one Member State in accordance with those rules, it should be respected by others. None of that is asserting anything beyond the width of the Treaty, not actually saying that people who are not bound by it are in some way bound to observe its rules."
p2,01:48:24.180,01:49:31.430,Respondent ,"But what is being suggested here is that by agreement, and I don't accept that there was agreement by the parties, but that's a matter that I'll return to. But by agreement, parties can, in essence, impose the jurisdiction of Member States on a non Member State where a child is resident because that's the essence of what will happen. The court here will decide the case, and if the court decides, or the court in France or the court in Belgium will decide the case, and will then make orders which are to be carried out in a third country, or we, would say, in a non Member State and that that can't possibly have been within the remit or the consideration of the European community when it was drafting this regulation, there's nothing that indicates that it was."
p2,01:49:34.070,01:50:20.080,Judge,"With Respect Miss Russel, that depends on questions of recognition and enforcement in the non Member State. And that surely is why such emphasis is given to the 1996 Convention, because that does deal with whether a non Member State may nevertheless be bound to recognise and enforce judgments in other countries. But in this particular situation where we have a state which is not party to that convention, and you'll correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think other than the protocol it is party, it is not a convention. It's not a treaty. It's not binding international law or anything like that. There is no international instrument to which Pakistan is a party which binds Pakistan to recognise and enforce the orders made in this country. I mean, that may be a reason for a judge here to decide that it's not necessarily in the best interest of this little boy for courts here to be beating the air, back to My Lord, Lord Clarke's problem. But it's not imposing on Pakistan anything that Pakistan hasn't accepted. As I understand it."
p2,01:50:51.660,01:51:54.780,Respondent ,"It's not imposing in the sense that, if the court here reaches decisions about a child and makes orders about a child, there is an imposition on the jurisdiction of Pakistan or indeed any other country in the world. And I am saying that I think that this, and we argue that this goes far outside the objectives of the regulation. And one of the other objectives that we would suggest that supports what we're saying is in paragraph 32 of the preamble. It says this article does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives as set out in the regulation and in all the preceding paragraphs of the preamble. And that objective is, as I said at the beginning, to create a mechanism for the European community to deal with and cooperate with civil matters that are necessary for the functioning of the, and I emphasis the words, internal market."
p2,01:52:11.790,01:52:53.670,Judge,"I wonder to what extent paragraph 4 is a reflection of pre existing practise. By that, I mean not just pre existing, the latest version of Brussels II, predating Brussels II at all. If one thinks back to practise before we became Member States and got involved in these things, the proposition, which is set out in paragraph 4 might be said to reflect what in extremis, if you like, a court might feel it ought to do, assuming that it was in a position to make some kind of effective order."
p2,01:52:53.680,01:52:54.740,Respondent ,You mean 12 (4)?
p2,01:52:54.860,01:53:11.410,Judge,"I mean 12 (4), sorry. It's 12 (4) I'm talking about. It's a kind of saving clause, in a way, to deal with an exceptional situation, particularly fastening on the last words. If it's impossible to hold proceedings in the third state in question, take the extreme case."
p2,01:53:11.850,01:53:41.910,Respondent ,"Yes, but then there's also the the provision for children who are perhaps stateless or certainly present but it's not possible to deal with their case in another country and that's Article 13 based in the child's presence. And I would say that is the Article that deals with situations of extremis, not Article 12 (4)."
p2,01:53:41.910,01:53:54.680,Judge,"Well, there are two examples of extreme situations. You know perfectly well where the child's habitual residence is. There is simply no system that can possibly answer the problem that needs to be addressed."
p2,01:53:54.690,01:54:01.890,Respondent ,"If My Lord looks at Brussels II, as opposed to Brussels II revised, which is at tab 6."
p2,01:54:01.900,01:54:02.270,Judge,Yes.
p2,01:54:04.840,01:54:22.560,Respondent ,"It does talk about applying the regulation to nationals of non Member States, and we would say that that is -- again, at this stage, My Lord's, I'm just looking at the term third state, and we would say that that's an example of a clear usage prior to Brussels II R, which shows that when the drafters of these regulations are considering non Member States, that's what they say."
p2,01:54:37.030,01:54:38.210,Judge,"Where is that, please?"
p2,01:54:38.840,01:54:46.870,Respondent ,"Sorry, it's at paragraph -- I do beg your pardon, My Lord, it's at paragraph 8 and it's the first page of Brussels."
p2,01:54:49.790,01:54:50.840,Judge,This is of the preamble.
p2,01:54:50.850,01:55:24.490,Respondent ,"Yes, and that the very absence of the use of that term in the guidance and in the regulation, except for those two specific points in 12 (4) and 61, again, we would say that's not by accident. If they meant non Member States, that's what would have been said and that there is some indication from the way that language has previously been used, that that is the case."
p2,01:55:24.500,01:55:25.950,Judge,Why not say a Member State? If it's intended to confine it?
p2,01:55:28.640,01:56:13.910,Respondent ,"What we would argue is that the third state there that's being referred to, particularly if we look at the words of Article 12 (4) paragraph -- in that paragraph which they discussed the third state, we would say what it refers to that term, third state, is a state that is not a contract -- a Member State, but a Member State that is not a contracting party to the Hague Convention, and that's why --"
p2,01:56:14.040,01:56:13.910,Judge,"That could perfectly well have been said, couldn't it?"
p2,01:56:16.330,01:56:18.150,Judge,Another state instead of a third state?
p2,01:56:18.160,01:56:35.580,Respondent ,"Yes. But what we're saying, the implication of this use, meaning that it's non contracting states, non contracting to the conventions and therefore subject to the regulations."
p2,01:56:35.590,01:56:45.060,Judge,"Why introduce the qualification, third, at all? My Lord points out, the context would be far more suitable to the use of the word, another."
p2,01:56:46.530,01:56:50.750,Respondent ,"It may be, but that's the term they've chosen to use."
p2,01:56:54.270,01:56:56.970,Judge,But they very frequently use the term Member State.
p2,01:56:57.160,01:56:59.860,Respondent ,They do and they use -- sorry.
p2,01:56:59.860,01:57:10.750,Judge,Is there any example where they use the term state without member? But it's quite clear that it's confined to a Member State?
p2,01:57:13.930,01:57:29.850,Respondent ,"They use the term Member State and there are -- My Lady, I'm ashamed to say that I cannot tell you. I'm sure that there are some -- may I return to that once I've had another opportunity to look at it?"
p2,01:57:30.520,01:57:44.140,Judge,It might be interesting to look at Directives out of this context altogether and see whether the expression third state has been used in any other context. Whether that would give us infallible guidance is another question.
p2,01:57:45.530,01:57:56.060,Judge,"At a quick glance, it looks as though they are very careful all the way through Brussels II Revision to use the word Member State where they mean Member State."
p2,01:57:56.070,01:59:02.850,Respondent ,"But they also look at, in the guidance, and that's a tab 2, I've referred to the beginning of that when they're considering Article 12 (3) and Article 12 (4). And you've already been referred to that by a very learned friend for the mother. The discussions are about the again, of course, the term Member State is used and the term Member State is used throughout except where it's saying that this article should be deemed, and one presumes that's where my learned friend got the word deemed from, but shall be deemed to be in the child's best interest when the child in question is habitually resident to a third state that is not a contracting state to the Hague Convention. To differentiate between Member States who are and Member States who are not contracting states to the Hague Convention."
p2,01:59:07.920,01:59:15.730,Judge,"Well, we've pretty well reached 4 o'clock, and I think you may be about to move on to a new topic."
p2,01:59:16.170,01:59:16.840,Respondent ,Yes.
p2,01:59:16.850,01:59:22.330,Judge,Would it be convenient to pause there? And we look forward very much to seeing you tomorrow morning at 10:30.
p2,01:59:22.340,01:59:27.350,Respondent ,Thank you very much.

p3,00:00:19.700,00:00:40.660,spk_1,
p3,00:00:40.980,00:00:43.110,spk_2,Before my friend resumes can I just tell
p3,00:00:43.230,00:00:44.120,spk_1,the court that my
p3,00:00:44.120,00:00:51.080,spk_2,client has come to court this morning with a copy of the decree absolute in her divorce. Having
p3,00:00:51.080,00:01:03.840,spk_3,been reading District Judge Brasse's judgments overnight it did cross my mind that there might not have been a recognised marriage to be dissolved. But fortunately there was.
p3,00:01:04.910,00:01:06.070,spk_1,"Well, it -- yes."
p3,00:01:07.290,00:01:08.750,spk_4,My instructions as to the
p3,00:01:09.240,00:01:11.070,spk_1,children order
p3,00:01:11.070,00:01:12.330,spk_2,is that there was no court order respect
p3,00:01:12.340,00:01:13.130,spk_1,of
p3,00:01:13.140,00:01:26.390,spk_2,"Q in the matrimonial proceedings because of the concurrent public law proceedings. Although there was the relevant certificate under Section 41. Can you make copies of that? I will. I will do that [crosstalk] -- Thank you very much. My Lord, yes."
p3,00:01:28.930,00:01:30.910,spk_5,What's the date of it?
p3,00:01:30.910,00:01:31.940,spk_2,4th of August 2004.
p3,00:01:31.950,00:01:33.060,spk_5,Thank you.
p3,00:01:33.640,00:01:38.510,spk_2,Decree outside the 17th of June. The
p3,00:01:38.520,00:01:39.410,spk_4,decree absolute 4th of August.
p3,00:01:39.410,00:01:40.540,spk_2,"Yeah, thank you."
p3,00:01:42.740,00:01:59.050,spk_3,"Could I also ask something else about the papers? We have got the two facts. Well, one is the fact finding and one is the reviewed fact-finding judgments of the district Judge Brasse. But there clearly was a third one. Third judgement? Yes, in which he -- On the occasion of his --"
p3,00:01:59.570,00:01:59.840,spk_2,
p3,00:01:59.850,00:02:03.040,spk_3,"Making the order, making the residence order."
p3,00:02:03.960,00:02:05.030,spk_4,Have we received a transcript of that judgement?
p3,00:02:05.030,00:02:05.170,spk_2,
p3,00:02:06.340,00:02:14.940,spk_3,"Well, it would be very, very helpful, obviously, as part of the background to see what he was thinking when he made the residence order that he did."
p3,00:02:14.950,00:02:15.460,spk_2,Yes.
p3,00:02:16.840,00:02:17.960,spk_3,If it's available.
p3,00:02:17.970,00:02:19.700,spk_2,Well we don't think that it has
p3,00:02:19.700,00:02:20.650,spk_0,been transcribed.
p3,00:02:21.240,00:02:41.610,spk_3,"No, well fairly clearly his second judgement. Except that there's a reference in Mr Justice Hedley's judgment in 2004, when he authorised removal to three judgments by District Judge Brasse, which rather suggests that there is something sitting somewhere."
p3,00:02:41.620,00:02:42.500,spk_4,We will make inquiries.
p3,00:02:42.550,00:02:45.530,spk_3,"Yes, thank you. It's only background but it all helps."
p3,00:02:45.530,00:02:46.260,spk_1,Of course.
p3,00:02:47.440,00:02:51.730,spk_2,"Right, now, Miss Russell, we were looking at third state."
p3,00:02:51.740,00:02:52.650,spk_3,I was looking at
p3,00:02:52.650,00:04:33.330,spk_0,"third state, but I wonder with your permission, my Lord, and that of my Lady, if I could just return to briefly to the matter of District Judges Brasse's second hearing in his second judgement. My Lady mentioned yesterday that she I think e suggested, and I hope I'm not putting words in my Lady's mouth, that she was somewhat surprised that it was not by way of appeal but by way of rehearing. And I thought maybe some explanation maybe helpful to the court. It's not at all unusual in care proceedings. It's not common, but it's not unusual in care proceedings for there to be a rehearing if fresh evidence arises after the first fact-finding. And indeed it's common that that is dealt with by way of rehearing either by the district judge or the circuit judge. There's similar provisions in the High Court. And just for the sake of completeness, I think it may be helpful to refer the court to the civil procedure rules, that is to say The County Court Rules order 37 rule 1. And if the fresh evidence reaches what I may describe as the Ladd and Marshall criteria, the case will almost always be reheard by the same district judge or the same circuit judge. The only exception usually would be if the judge was criticised, then it would be considered inappropriate for that judge to rehear it. And it happens frequently."
p3,00:04:33.460,00:04:33.970,spk_3,Are the County
p3,00:04:33.970,00:04:34.990,spk_0,Court Rules still in
p3,00:04:35.000,00:04:35.660,spk_3,operation?
p3,00:04:36.140,00:04:42.150,spk_0,"Well, that's the -- Yes, sorry. In some respects, yes, they are."
p3,00:04:42.160,00:04:43.540,spk_3,"This is still in operation, isn't it?"
p3,00:04:43.600,00:04:48.420,spk_0,"Yes, yes. I looked at it last night, and there is --"
p3,00:04:48.420,00:04:51.740,spk_3,"What does it say? Forgive me, what does it say?"
p3,00:04:51.740,00:05:30.970,spk_0,"I haven't, forgive me, I haven't written down its precise details, but as I said, it's common practise and there are similar provisions in the High Court, which arises from the Supreme Court Act 1981 Section 17. My Lady I'm just, and my Lord's, I'm just pointing that out because I thought there was some concern raised about the nature of that hearing and I wanted to try and say it before this court the fact that this quite often happens because fresh evidence is quite often"
p3,00:05:30.980,00:05:32.300,spk_3,forthcoming
p3,00:05:32.310,00:05:38.180,spk_0,"after a fact-finding hear for many, many reasons, some of which I think are pretty obvious."
p3,00:05:38.180,00:05:41.670,spk_4,What are the mechanics? How does it come back to the --
p3,00:05:41.680,00:06:16.660,spk_0,"Well, what happened in this case and what normally happens is that an application is made to the court for a rehearing. And in this case, I understand, although obviously I wasn't involved at the time, that such an application was made by those representing the father, the first respondent, the local authority, who was obviously involved in the proceedings at the time, and the guardian's representative because of the fresh evidence which you will have seen alluded to in District Judge Brasse's, as it then was, his second judgment."
p3,00:06:21.340,00:06:27.460,spk_3,I didn't see anything in that judgment which addressed his mind to Ladd and Marshall.
p3,00:06:27.840,00:06:41.660,spk_0,"I don't think it -- well there isn't. But what I'm saying my Lady, is that it's -- I'm not trying to give evidence. But as a care practitioner there are many circumstances that I can think"
p3,00:06:41.660,00:06:42.320,spk_1,of and that I've
p3,00:06:42.320,00:06:46.330,spk_0,experienced where such a thing has happened for obvious reasons.
p3,00:06:46.340,00:06:49.460,spk_3,I can quite understand why it might.
p3,00:06:50.840,00:06:51.010,spk_0,I
p3,00:06:51.010,00:06:53.760,spk_3,am concerned that
p3,00:06:54.740,00:06:55.740,spk_0,
p3,00:06:55.750,00:06:57.300,spk_3,family practitioners --
p3,00:06:57.640,00:06:58.660,spk_0,"The case of -- Sorry, I beg your pardon."
p3,00:06:59.140,00:07:28.540,spk_3,"I am concerned that family practitioners, from time to time, do the sensible practical thing rather than the thing that is entirely correct in accordance with legal procedures which is why I raised the question in the first place. And I became even more concerned last night when I read the two judgments so it's obviously something that -- It's a background point in this case -- Of course it is -- But nevertheless --"
p3,00:07:29.550,00:08:17.740,spk_0,"My Lady, maybe we can provide you with relevant County Court Rule and the case of O'Connor and Din from 1997 which is reported at one family law reports 226 and we will provide the court with a copy if the court would find that helpful, where it's proposed that the challenge of the decision of the county court because of fresh evidence, the appropriate course, and that's the Court of Appeal authority, the appropriate course is to apply to the court under the County Court Rule that I have already referred the court to, for a rehearing rather than an appeal. So it's not based on pragmatism although I"
p3,00:08:17.740,00:08:18.620,spk_1,completely
p3,00:08:18.620,00:08:25.920,spk_0,accept what my Lady says about family practitioners reliance on the pragmatic approach.
p3,00:08:25.930,00:08:28.050,spk_2,"What was the date of that decision? Sorry, I missed it."
p3,00:08:28.050,00:08:29.380,spk_0,1997.
p3,00:08:29.380,00:08:30.510,spk_3,Thank you.
p3,00:08:30.520,00:08:43.300,spk_0,"And the report that I was looking at last night was one family law reports 226. And if my Lord would find it useful, we can provide the court with a copy of that decision."
p3,00:08:43.310,00:08:44.840,spk_3,And that's a Court of Appeal decision?
p3,00:08:44.840,00:09:04.440,spk_0,"That is a Court of Appeal decision. And that's certainly what's followed. And as I said there's similar procedure that is followed in the High Court. An application is made for rehearing. But there is not, there are not rules which provide for that. The only provisions at the moment is the"
p3,00:09:04.450,00:09:06.030,spk_1,Supreme Court Act
p3,00:09:06.040,00:09:19.500,spk_0,"1981 Section 17(2). And again, if the court would like to have that that can all be provided and I apologise for not having it now. I just thought it would be helpful by way of background information."
p3,00:09:19.500,00:09:30.030,spk_3,"I'm sure we can find it. Thank you very much my Lady. But we don't have a copy of the application, do we?"
p3,00:09:30.170,00:09:36.220,spk_0,No we don't. And I don't know if they're certainly I haven't seen one in the documents that I have seen
p3,00:09:36.220,00:09:37.040,spk_1,one in the
p3,00:09:37.040,00:09:38.430,spk_0,documents that I have
p3,00:09:38.430,00:09:39.530,spk_4,seen from the
p3,00:09:39.540,00:09:41.060,spk_0,previous proceedings.
p3,00:09:41.220,00:10:13.080,spk_3,"I mean the way that it comes over, just reading the judgement, that's all I have, the way that it comes over is he has a split hearing, he hears the evidence about the injuries and makes it draws his conclusions about who caused them. He then, of course, puts it off for the usual further inquiries in order to work out what's the right the answer to the way forward. And at that next hearing he decides that he's going to review his earlier findings."
p3,00:10:13.250,00:10:29.050,spk_0,"I fully understand my Lady's disquiet, particularly after reading the judgement. And indeed that is how I, in many ways, read it myself when I saw it myself. But I understand that that's what's happened and I felt it was"
p3,00:10:29.540,00:10:30.460,spk_3,appropriate
p3,00:10:30.470,00:10:42.800,spk_0,to draw to this court the authority for rehearing which positively suggests that rehearing is in fact the correct way to deal with this situation.
p3,00:10:43.290,00:10:43.740,spk_2,It may be pragmatic -- [crosstalk] --
p3,00:10:43.740,00:10:44.780,spk_0,The father was unrepresented at the time.
p3,00:10:45.170,00:10:48.050,spk_2,"No no,"
p3,00:10:48.050,00:10:48.730,spk_0,he was represented.
p3,00:10:48.810,00:10:49.560,spk_2,Oh he was at that stage?
p3,00:10:50.140,00:11:09.690,spk_0,"And at that time during the care proceedings he, as I understand it, there was an application made partly on behalf of the local authority and others but not by the mother for a rehearing because of fresh evidence that had arisen. Yes."
p3,00:11:09.930,00:11:10.910,spk_2,That's
p3,00:11:10.910,00:11:12.420,spk_3,not surprising. Not
p3,00:11:12.420,00:11:13.500,spk_0,at all. And
p3,00:11:13.500,00:11:14.690,spk_3,"it's not unusual,"
p3,00:11:14.690,00:11:22.710,spk_0,"and it's absolutely not unusual for, as my Lady knows, for fresh evidence to rise after a fact-finding."
p3,00:11:22.710,00:11:25.410,spk_3,"Well, it's one of my reasons for disquiet about split hearings."
p3,00:11:26.170,00:11:35.230,spk_2,I asked my question simply because one can understand that accidents would happen if people are not represented but it's a little more disturbing if they were represented.
p3,00:11:35.740,00:11:43.190,spk_3,The situation as I understand it and the reason I'm speaking is so that I can be corrected if I'm
p3,00:11:43.330,00:11:43.990,spk_0,"wrong. Of course, yes."
p3,00:11:45.440,00:12:01.640,spk_3,Is that the judge made his findings as to what he thought had happened and the next stage normally is that there is then assessment of the parenting capacities of the parents.
p3,00:12:01.640,00:12:02.720,spk_0,By experts.
p3,00:12:02.720,00:12:06.880,spk_3,By experts in order to work out what the right way forward for this --
p3,00:12:06.880,00:12:08.210,spk_0,"Risk assessment, yes. -- Little child is."
p3,00:12:08.220,00:12:15.590,spk_3,And it was as a result of the experts engaging with the case.
p3,00:12:16.110,00:12:17.190,spk_0,That's exactly right.
p3,00:12:17.190,00:12:22.360,spk_3,That they took a different view from the judge as to who was the more likely perpetrators
p3,00:12:22.370,00:12:56.450,spk_0,"of these injuries. Exactly. And concerns were raised by the experts as to the perpetrator of the injuries, and as a result the local authority felt it proper but supported as I said by the guardian and by the father's representatives, to invite the court to re-hear and that's what the court did. And whether there was a formal application or whether it was made orally at the beginning, that, I'm afraid I don't know if"
p3,00:12:57.510,00:12:57.930,spk_1,my
p3,00:12:57.930,00:13:07.210,spk_0,learned friend might [inaudible]. There was no written application.
p3,00:13:07.670,00:13:08.420,spk_2,"Sorry, there"
p3,00:13:08.420,00:13:09.160,spk_0,"was? There was no, I"
p3,00:13:09.300,00:13:10.200,spk_2,"beg your pardon my Lord,"
p3,00:13:10.210,00:13:16.840,spk_0,"there was no written application, but there is a legal basis for it, and it is considerable."
p3,00:13:16.850,00:13:19.550,spk_3,"Yes, but it is unfortunate, is it not?"
p3,00:13:19.940,00:13:29.870,spk_0,"Well, my Lady, I just feel that it may be unfortunate but it's not without a proper legal framework and that the court made."
p3,00:13:29.870,00:13:39.820,spk_3,"But of course, if the proper application has to be made then the proper legal framework will be addressed. It may be that it was perfectly alright in this case. I know not, of course, because I haven't seen the evidence."
p3,00:13:41.610,00:13:47.200,spk_0,An application was made but it was oral and I can't comment on whether it covered every aspect.
p3,00:13:47.700,00:13:51.670,spk_2,O'Connor is widely known is it? [Inaudible].
p3,00:13:52.050,00:13:53.140,spk_3,I have to say
p3,00:13:53.140,00:14:18.620,spk_0,"that it's widely known. Yes. I mean, I'm involved in several such cases myself and it has happened. I've even heard them. I mean, it has happened and it does happen because there are so often fresh evidence arises for many reasons, including people changing their mind about the evidence they gave in the first"
p3,00:14:18.620,00:14:19.450,spk_3,place.
p3,00:14:19.500,00:14:28.490,spk_5,"This appears to be down to a change, as the judge put it, a Paragraph 6 of his second judgment. A change of the information given by the parents to the"
p3,00:14:28.490,00:14:29.970,spk_0,"experts. Experts, that's what it was."
p3,00:14:30.150,00:14:36.260,spk_5,Presumably if these points have been live there would have been ventilated at the subsequent attempts to appeal this powerful case.
p3,00:14:36.740,00:14:43.550,spk_0,"That I can't comment on but I'm sure that they were. I mean, I can't imagine for one minute that --"
p3,00:14:44.440,00:14:49.300,spk_3,Don't let us engage any more time.
p3,00:14:49.300,00:14:50.210,spk_0,"No, I'm sorry my Lady. I was trying to be helpful --"
p3,00:14:50.220,00:14:57.790,spk_3,The worry that I had about the way in which this case had developed previously. It's all water under the bridge now.
p3,00:14:57.800,00:14:58.900,spk_2,Should we go back to Thursday?
p3,00:14:59.030,00:15:00.050,spk_0,"Yes, please."
p3,00:15:00.050,00:15:01.500,spk_2,Thank you. Thank
p3,00:15:01.500,00:15:02.530,spk_3,you for indulging

p3,00:15:07.200,00:15:21.510,spk_0,"would like and would ask you to do, my Lords and my Lady, is to look again at the precise use of the phrase within the regulation itself"
p3,00:15:21.520,00:15:22.290,spk_1,because it
p3,00:15:22.300,00:15:24.710,spk_0,is this regulation

p3,00:15:26.850,00:15:27.600,spk_1,with which
p3,00:15:27.610,00:15:37.060,spk_0,"this court is concerned. And at the risk of what may seem to be real pedantry,"
p3,00:15:37.840,00:15:38.200,spk_1,I would
p3,00:15:38.200,00:15:39.760,spk_0,"like to start,"
p3,00:15:40.930,00:15:41.110,spk_6,and
p3,00:15:41.110,00:16:53.840,spk_0,"I hope not to take too long about this because my Lord's have already heard so much about it, by looking at 12(4) where the phrase itself arises. The territory where the child has his or her habitual residence in the territory of a third state. And the piece of pedantry that I am indulging in is asking the court to look at the fact that state has a capital s. Now if I could go back to the fact that it's clear from the use of language in copious amounts of commentary and literature that third state, that's to say, small t small s, is used constantly to mean a non-contracting state. I accept that on the face of it, this language would without more read as if third state here means non-contracting state to this regulation and indeed to the Brussels Conventions generally."
p3,00:16:54.640,00:17:17.360,spk_2,"It's one of these problems that one has, in my own experience, with law reporters. If I use capital s for state, they tend to strike it out and put it lower case. There's a sort of house style, and my impression is I may be wrong about this, but my impression is, when you get a council regulation or any EEC document state always has a capital s."
p3,00:17:17.939,00:17:18.230,spk_0,But --
p3,00:17:18.230,00:17:26.100,spk_2,Is that wrong? You're suggesting that if capital S belongs to people who are within the EU and anybody outside is small s.
p3,00:17:26.100,00:17:27.959,spk_0,That is what I'm suggesting.
p3,00:17:27.970,00:17:28.950,spk_2,
p3,00:17:28.950,00:18:29.450,spk_0,"I'm suggesting -- But I'm not suggesting it in any way in a facetious manner. I'm suggesting it within the context of this regulation and I intend to use, if I may, further example of what I say third state means within the context of this regulation. But I do think because, even whether or not there's a house style and I accept that there is, but whether or not there's a house style, there is also care taken in drafting. And I do not think that it is by mere happenstance, that s has a capital -- that state has a capital s. I think it's because, and we would say it's because, it refers to a third member state. And the reason that I say that is that we would say, for example in paragraphs 2(4), that this is a provision which introduces a qualification which"
p3,00:18:29.840,00:18:30.280,spk_1,
p3,00:18:30.290,00:21:17.440,spk_0,"is what should be considered to be in the child's interest. The presumption being that if the member state in which the child is habitually resident is not a contracting party to the Hague Convention then it's presumed to be in the child's interests. It's presumed to be in the child's interest for the country favoured by and agreed on by the parents because the only use throughout this document for a third state on the construction that is being put to you, my Lords, on behalf of the appellant, is that there is one situation where this regulation would apply to non-contracting countries and that is if the parents or the parties choose that it should. And in no other circumstance would it be, would it apply to third countries or to non-contracting countries if I can use that term. That in itself, I think, is a curiosity. But I think that what and what we're trying to suggest to you, is that if you look at the construction of Article 12 in its entirety, the parties that are essentially referred to our parties first of all, to a marriage and parties who are parents to a child upon which some decision is going to be made with reference to parental responsibility. Now we would say that if it would not be unusual or unheard of for the parents to be living in separate states themselves, and that there may be three states involved and that it is for that reason, that the third state is referred to. So for example, and I mean one can only give examples, the parents may both live in Belgium, the father may spend a lot of his time in France, and the child may live with grandparents in Germany and they choose France to be the country that they want the matter to be heard for matters of convenience or matters that are important to them. They choose it, they choose it unequivocally. They go to the court and say, We wholeheartedly want this court to deal with it. And that that is where the third state comes in. And I would say that Article 6(1),"
p3,00:21:17.530,00:21:18.270,spk_1,if
p3,00:21:18.280,00:21:24.960,spk_0,"you accept my construction of third capital s state, supports what I'm saying."
p3,00:21:26.740,00:21:33.530,spk_2,What are the situations on your approach where there could be a second state as opposed to a third?
p3,00:21:33.760,00:22:43.980,spk_0,"Well, I think that if it's a second state it means just the state that the child's living in. In other words, the child who is not a party to this or these discussions between these parents because the child's not represented or isn't deciding which jurisdiction. I think it's allowing for the fact that there will be cases and may often be cases, particularly in Hague Convention cases or abduction cases, where there are three states involved. Say, for example, if we look at Article 61 where a parent removes a child from territory A, country A, to territory C, to territory B, and the child's habitual residence is actually in territory C. That, I would say is what Article 61(b) is referring to when it talks about third states. And I can see our Lord's, that some of you are looking quizzical about that but I will return to why I'm saying."
p3,00:22:43.990,00:22:59.910,spk_4,"I'm guilty to looking quizzical. If I have understood your argument correctly, you are saying the word third is used to accommodate the possibility that there will be three states involved. Is that right?"
p3,00:23:00.110,00:23:01.220,spk_3,"Well, to accommodate"
p3,00:23:01.220,00:23:20.890,spk_0,"that possibility and to point out that it's a state that is outside the one that one would normally look at, which is the state that the child is living in. That is the presumption that you start off with the state that the child's living in their parents' lives --"
p3,00:23:21.060,00:23:22.550,spk_4,Why the word third instead of the word different.
p3,00:23:23.140,00:23:28.390,spk_0,"Well, I don't know why but I"
p3,00:23:28.390,00:23:29.310,spk_3,am saying
p3,00:23:29.320,00:23:53.140,spk_0,that that is what is meant here and the reason the s is capital is for a reason and that is that throughout their talking about member states' capitals and the third state and I think it's particularly noticeable if one looks at Article 61 which is dealing particularly with the recognition
p3,00:23:53.490,00:23:54.170,spk_1,of
p3,00:23:54.740,00:24:57.750,spk_0,"the of -- sorry of judgments or the enforcement of judgments in relation to the Hague Convention. And in that particular situation, what I would say is the use of third state in this subparagraph means I think what I've already tried to illustrate, that when a judgement is given in member state number 1, in respect of the territory of member state number 1, that judgement will be both recognised and enforced even if the child has his habitual residence in member state number 3, which is also a contracting state to the Hague Convention. In other words, member state number 3 is a contracting state to the Convention. But regardless of whether or not member state 1 where the judgement was made was a contracting state to The Hague Convention."
p3,00:24:57.760,00:25:02.050,spk_5,But why restrict it in that way? What's the rationale for restricting it in that way?
p3,00:25:02.740,00:25:31.950,spk_0,"Well if it's not restricted in that way, and this is the second part of my argument really my Lord, is that if it's not restricted in that way, then the restriction is this. The only time that this regulation can apply to non-member states or third states or whatever one wishes to call them that are not they're not members of the European Union"
p3,00:25:31.970,00:25:33.100,spk_1,is when
p3,00:25:33.130,00:25:40.570,spk_0,"the parents choose it, and at no other time will that regulation apply."
p3,00:25:41.740,00:25:41.950,spk_5,What's odd about that>
p3,00:25:42.540,00:25:43.050,spk_0,
p3,00:25:43.440,00:25:44.640,spk_3,"Well, I would"
p3,00:25:44.640,00:25:45.820,spk_0,suggest that it's not
p3,00:25:45.830,00:25:46.760,spk_1,"odd, but it's"
p3,00:25:46.770,00:25:54.860,spk_0,"incongruent to suggest that it would apply in that situation but it wouldn't apply, for example, under Article"
p3,00:25:54.860,00:25:56.910,spk_1,15 where the court
p3,00:25:56.910,00:25:58.950,spk_0,is looking at which
p3,00:25:58.950,00:26:00.090,spk_1,courts would
p3,00:26:00.100,00:26:05.000,spk_0,be -- And if I just turn to that and ask you to turn to
p3,00:26:05.000,00:26:05.730,spk_2,"it,"
p3,00:26:06.050,00:27:25.440,spk_0,"the transfer to a court better placed to hear the case. Now it's absolutely without doubt easy to imagine that the court which was best placed or even better placed to hear a case may be a court that is not in the European Union. Yet, there is no provision in Article 15 for the court of its own motion to transfer the case even if it's the most obvious place for the case to be heard. And it's the incongruency set against the entirety of the regulation which I alluded to yesterday and I have alluded to in our document that is filed with the court, which is to deal with the internal market of the European Union recognition and enforcement of judgments within that areas and the facility of the legal framework to facilitate the free movement of people, including dealing with their family lives."
p3,00:27:25.450,00:27:48.270,spk_2,"Does one not have to bear in mind, looking at Article 15, the point that we discussed yesterday with Mr Baker, this really is an exercise of jurisdiction. In Article 15, the court is a court which otherwise who didn't transfer it would be perfectly competent to exercise jurisdiction. That sort of thing a court can do it if it has no jurisdiction. Yes."
p3,00:27:48.840,00:27:49.460,spk_0,So
p3,00:27:49.460,00:27:58.980,spk_2,"once I got past Article 12, by the time you get to Article 15, and I'm not quite sure how Article 15 can really help you on understand this"
p3,00:27:58.990,00:27:59.670,spk_6,third state in Article 12.
p3,00:27:59.680,00:30:29.540,spk_0,"It seems, if I can elaborate what I'm saying at the moment, my Lord, I think it might explain what I'm trying to say about the incongruity of Article 12 being the only situation in which it would be considered apposite for parents to choose jurisdiction even if the child is not living within that jurisdiction and that is that part of the raison d'etre behind the regulation is the enforcement of judgments and the recognition of judgments. And if parents choose to deal with a country, whatever the country is be it Pakistan, be it United States of America, be it the Ukraine where the child lives, be it Jamaica. One can think of many countries that have very close connections with this country where children quite often live long term with extended family members, either after public law proceedings or within private law proceedings. And the parents choose this country or another country within the United -- Within the European Union to be the jurisdiction to hear the case, when it's patently obvious that the other court may not neither recognise the judgement nor enforce it. And how that supports the generality and the specific desire of this aim, I think is the proper term of the regulation, which is also set out in the guidance, it's hard to explain and I think is incongruent, because even if enforcement is not the main priority, it's certainly a priority, and for parents to be able to choose not to have a case heard where their child is living and nothing can be done about the result, whatever the result is, even if it's the right result in inverted commas, seems to be totally outside the aims of this regulation. And I'd ask you if you would --"
p3,00:30:29.550,00:30:35.620,spk_5,But it's all subject to the ultimate decision by the court as to what is in the best interests of the child.
p3,00:30:35.630,00:31:06.820,spk_0,"Well not according to the proposition that's put forward on behalf of the appellant, because the best interests of the child may not coincide with the unequivocal agreement of the parents that the case should be heard here and the court may be ignorant of or not fully informed about the reasons for the case not being heard here or in another EU country. So, it's not --"
p3,00:31:06.820,00:31:12.600,spk_2,Doesn't the court have to apply its mind to the third of the hurdles in the --
p3,00:31:12.600,00:31:13.370,spk_0,Interests of the
p3,00:31:13.370,00:31:14.960,spk_2,child. Yes and --
p3,00:31:14.960,00:31:43.070,spk_0,"Well if the parents say it is in the interests of the child, these are the reasons why we say it's in the interests of the child. We unequivocally both of us asked that the court hear it. The child later comes along or perhaps the child and a carer come along and say, No it's not. They've left out this or time has passed and that has happened or, you know, they're glossing over some of the back --"
p3,00:31:43.070,00:31:45.360,spk_5,This is where we get to Mr Baker's solution to that.
p3,00:31:45.840,00:31:46.620,spk_0,Which is?
p3,00:31:46.620,00:31:50.960,spk_5,Which is that the court can decline to make an order.
p3,00:31:52.940,00:31:58.300,spk_0,Well [pauses] it seems to me that either the interest --
p3,00:31:58.300,00:32:06.220,spk_5,"Assuming that's not contrary to the principles in Owusu as to which said query. But assuming it's not, then that would be a solution to it."
p3,00:32:06.600,00:32:18.050,spk_2,"And as far as Owusu is concerned, it again I would suggest that it's an exercise of jurisdiction as opposed to declining it and you would say no order having considered the situation."
p3,00:32:18.340,00:32:21.610,spk_5,One would have to look at Owusu to see if that's really right. But on that assumption --
p3,00:32:22.000,00:32:23.450,spk_2,"That's a possible argument,"
p3,00:32:23.480,00:32:24.780,spk_3,anyway.
p3,00:32:24.790,00:32:49.010,spk_2,"You see I can't ignore the very last line of Paragraph 4 which is lurking at the back of all of this, that you may reach a situation where the third state it's impossible to hold proceedings in question. It's rather unlikely that would be true of a member state of the EU. I mean it may suggest that what's really being looked at is very far away of which we know little."
p3,00:32:49.010,00:32:49.820,spk_0,"Impossibility, sorry my Lord."
p3,00:32:50.860,00:32:52.110,spk_3,But I don't think
p3,00:32:52.110,00:33:05.960,spk_0,"impossibility is just talking about legal impossibility. I think impossibility is talking about practical impossibilities or factual impossibilities, and to limit it to legal would be wrong."
p3,00:33:06.640,00:33:11.880,spk_2,"Well, it's more likely to be a practical problem, isn't it?"
p3,00:33:12.580,00:33:15.740,spk_0,"Well, indeed, and one can see where there may be practical"
p3,00:33:15.740,00:33:17.260,spk_2,problems. It
p3,00:33:17.260,00:33:42.450,spk_0,may be highly practical to hear the case where the parents are both living because there are issues concerning the parents alone. Or it may be impractical to hear it in the case in the court [inaudible] where the child is living for practical reasons too.
p3,00:33:42.840,00:34:15.659,spk_2,"Well, can we gather the points together? I see that one point which you began with is the capital s point and then there's a numeral point, is the third point, the third ,which you say is a guide as well. And then you're making the general point that it seems contrary to, am I putting this too strongly? Contrary to principal or common sense that parents should be able to just make this choice as it were for the child and the child comes in later and if Mr Baker is right the past has been sold. Yes. You say that seems quite unfair. Yes and I say"
p3,00:34:15.659,00:34:17.409,spk_3,that that
p3,00:34:17.409,00:34:28.960,spk_0,"is also not in keeping with what seems to be set out in the regulation itself, particularly at Paragraph 19 of the preamble."
p3,00:34:29.740,00:34:31.379,spk_1,This
p3,00:34:31.379,00:34:33.659,spk_3,"last point about parents making the choice of the child,"
p3,00:34:33.659,00:34:34.620,spk_1,which is a
p3,00:34:34.629,00:34:40.659,spk_3,very understandable point because that point as a policy point would apply equally to a choice between member states.
p3,00:34:42.639,00:35:44.350,spk_0,"It would, but my additional point and I don't think my Lord came to that, is that I think it is really, truly and we would argue it's incongruent with the aims of the regulation to be contemplating reaching judgments. I mean, I accept that courts can make no order, but there seems little point in hearing a case when one can see quite clearly that one is either going to make no order or one is going to be unable to enforce the order that one makes as a result of one's decision. And if I could ask you to look at page 17 of tab 2, which is the guidance and looking at sorry, Article 12(3)."
p3,00:35:45.340,00:35:45.540,spk_3,
p3,00:35:46.740,00:35:47.180,spk_0,First of
p3,00:35:47.180,00:35:48.430,spk_1,"all, I'd"
p3,00:35:48.430,00:36:05.430,spk_0,ask you to look at that. Again the only reference there is to a third state that's not a contracting state to the -- I'm looking at the part that's headed Article 12(4)
p3,00:36:05.430,00:36:06.480,spk_1,in
p3,00:36:06.480,00:36:07.340,spk_0,bold.
p3,00:36:08.780,00:36:09.460,spk_6,"Sorry, which page?"
p3,00:36:09.630,00:36:11.400,spk_0,17 of tab 2 my
p3,00:36:11.400,00:36:11.840,spk_1,Lord.
p3,00:36:14.230,00:36:14.650,spk_4,Yes.
p3,00:36:16.030,00:36:51.930,spk_0,Now that's looking at Article 12(4) and it is setting out what I would say is the qualifying provision that the child's best interest will be presumed to be when the child is habitually resident in a third capital s state that's not a contracting state to the 1996 Hague Convention. Again I say that when read in the continuum of the entire document it's referring again it's the capital s point.
p3,00:36:51.940,00:36:54.250,spk_5,Is there an example of a small s?
p3,00:36:55.130,00:36:56.620,spk_0,Not in this.
p3,00:36:56.620,00:36:58.090,spk_5,"In either the regulation or the guidance? Not in this, no."
p3,00:37:00.130,00:37:25.660,spk_0,"I mean, I've looked through it and there is not the only and the third point I'm going to come to in due course is that where the regulation that we introduced into the argument, the most recent regulation which is looking at making bilateral agreements is concerned, the term third country is used throughout."
p3,00:37:26.230,00:37:27.630,spk_2,Country with a small c?
p3,00:37:27.640,00:37:43.430,spk_0,"Yes, meaning any country in the world. Or, in this case, I would say that the states have a capital s because it means not any state in the world that a member state, a third state."
p3,00:37:43.440,00:37:44.290,spk_6,If you do a search --
p3,00:37:44.300,00:37:45.540,spk_0,"I can see that, my"
p3,00:37:45.540,00:37:46.750,spk_1,"Lord, that you are not"
p3,00:37:46.830,00:37:47.830,spk_0,taken by this argument in any way. If you do
p3,00:37:49.210,00:38:04.840,spk_6,"a search on Westlaw third state in the EU section. I didn't get any further than finding that there are thousand mentions -- My Lord, I have [crosstalk] -- My recollection is every one had a capital s. At least the first couple of pages."
p3,00:38:05.520,00:38:33.120,spk_0,But there are also many references to third country where it's clear what they're intending to mean. I think it's unfortunate because basically part of my argument is that third state is used in both situations and that what I'm trying to say really is that it is wrong for it to be used in that way within the context of this regulation.
p3,00:38:33.120,00:38:36.980,spk_6,Can I go back just for a moment to Article 61?
p3,00:38:36.990,00:38:38.200,spk_0,"Yes, of course."
p3,00:38:39.120,00:38:45.070,spk_6,And ask you a question which I think I asked yesterday. But I want to get a clear answer
p3,00:38:39.120,00:38:45.070,spk_6,from you.
p3,00:38:47.420,00:38:49.100,spk_0,"Yes, I apologise if I didn't give you one yesterday."
p3,00:38:49.430,00:38:58.600,spk_6,"Well, if you're right on the meaning of third state in B --"
p3,00:38:58.710,00:38:59.450,spk_0,Yes.
p3,00:39:00.320,00:39:05.150,spk_6,Would Article 61 be any different if B altogether were not there?
p3,00:39:06.520,00:39:07.960,spk_0,"Yes, I think it would be."
p3,00:39:07.970,00:39:08.740,spk_6,What does it add?
p3,00:39:09.320,00:39:35.820,spk_0,"Because I think that if B weren't there, it would mean that if the child was living in a third state and it was a non-contracting member to the Hague Convention, the interests of the child would be taken to be from Article 12(4), the only other place that it's mentioned to be that the child --"
p3,00:39:35.910,00:40:01.190,spk_6,"Yes but B is talking about recognition and enforcement of judgments. So, A says -- The effect of A is that concerns the relationship with the Hague Convention, This regulation shall apply when the child has his or her habitual residence on the territory of a member state and therefore all the recognition and enforcement provisions would come into play there."
p3,00:40:01.200,00:40:16.480,spk_0,I think that that is there to deal with and no doubt I'll be corrected if I'm wrong. But I think that that is there and I am suggesting very strongly that it's there to deal with cases of abduction and they're saying that even --
p3,00:40:16.510,00:40:18.540,spk_3,This isn't about abduction. This is about recognition and enforcement.
p3,00:40:18.920,00:40:20.500,spk_0,But I'm trying to explain --
p3,00:40:20.510,00:40:22.020,spk_3,But it's not about abduction.
p3,00:40:23.090,00:40:26.050,spk_0,"My Lady, if I could finish trying to say what I'm trying to say --"
p3,00:40:26.150,00:40:29.890,spk_3,"Well, it might help if you finish listening to my Lord's question before you tried"
p3,00:40:29.890,00:40:31.240,spk_0,answering it.
p3,00:40:31.710,00:40:40.120,spk_6,The point is that this is about the relationship with The Hague Convention. Yes. And on your interpretation of
p3,00:40:40.130,00:40:40.730,spk_2,"B,"
p3,00:40:41.110,00:40:45.030,spk_6,it says that
p3,00:40:45.610,00:40:47.470,spk_1,if
p3,00:40:47.480,00:41:04.240,spk_6,"the child is habitually resident in an another member state, which is a contracting party to the Hague Convention, this regulation applies, but A already says it applies."
p3,00:41:06.710,00:41:32.560,spk_0,"No it doesn't. It says that it applies where the child has his habitual residence in a territory of a member state and makes no reference to whether it's a contracting member of the Hague Convention or not and that's the difference. And I know this is not about abduction, my Lady --"
p3,00:41:32.560,00:41:41.830,spk_2,"You're saying B subtracts something from A. A seems so general. A, just, a member state, unqualified."
p3,00:41:44.210,00:41:58.500,spk_0,I think that what it's meant there is that if the Hague Convention and the regulation have two different aims and have different outcomes if they are both
p3,00:41:58.500,00:41:59.790,spk_3,followed.
p3,00:41:59.790,00:42:52.120,spk_0,"What it's saying is that if a decision is made in A in country one about country two, regardless of the fact that the child living in country three may have other -- There may be different outcomes on the application of the Hague Convention, the regulation -- Sorry, the judgment of country one would be both recognised and enforced. It's about the operation of the Hague Convention and the difference that that may make if the child is living in that country and two other countries, maybe one who is not a contracting member to the Hague Convention make a decision while a decisions made about one."
p3,00:42:52.500,00:43:15.310,spk_6,"But if it means a non-member state then it does begin to make sense because it's telling the member states that if the Hague Convention would lead to a different result as regards recognition and enforcement, then Brussels II Revised trumps it."
p3,00:43:16.500,00:43:19.600,spk_0,"It is saying that, yes, but I would say that it's more than that --"
p3,00:43:19.610,00:43:24.110,spk_5,Are there some practical examples? What would be an example of that?
p3,00:43:25.080,00:43:26.110,spk_0,An example of?
p3,00:43:26.110,00:43:28.810,spk_5,Of the position being different under the Hague Convention.
p3,00:43:30.500,00:44:10.360,spk_0,"A specific example? Well, if the child is resident in a country that's a party to the Hague Convention then the provisions of that Convention would apply. If the two other member states are not parties to The Hague Convention  then there would be some presumption in the third country that the Convention would apply, would trump the decision made in the first country, which was a non-contracting"
p3,00:44:10.370,00:44:11.360,spk_1,state to the Hague
p3,00:44:11.360,00:46:16.680,spk_0,"Convention. If I, my Lord, if I may move on and move back really to the regulation itself and if we look at the guidelines to Article 61 and 62 which are at page 45 of tab 2. And I think, perhaps, answer in some way the question that I was just asked by my Lord, Lord Clarke. This is looking at the juxtaposition between the enforcement of orders under the regulation or under the Convention. And question c is, Does the case concern the recognition and or enforcement of a decision issued by a court in another member state? And goes on to describe that it's irrelevant whether the child concerned lives within the territory of a particular state, so long as the state has competence to meet the decision. Hence, sorry, the rules and recognition and enforcement of the regulation apply to decisions issued by the courts of a member state. Even if the child concerned lives in a third state which is a contracting party to the Convention.  The aim, and this is the part that I would ask my Lord and my Lady to pay attention to, if they are in any way following the argument that I am trying to make, and that is that the aim is to ensure the creation of a common jurisdictional"
p3,00:46:16.690,00:46:18.090,spk_1,area which requires
p3,00:46:18.090,00:46:56.900,spk_0,"that all decisions issued by competent courts within the European Union are recognised and enforced under a common set of rules. And that is the aim behind the whole the totality of the regulation. And it is that incongruity, I'm suggesting, is seen in paragraph in, sorry, in Article 12(4) in particular."
p3,00:46:58.280,00:47:03.600,spk_5,The third state in the last paragraph must be a non-member state or include a non member state.
p3,00:47:05.580,00:47:06.160,spk_0,"Well, even if --"
p3,00:47:06.160,00:47:06.360,spk_5,In the guidance note I mean.
p3,00:47:06.810,00:47:43.410,spk_0,"Yes. But even if it does, that is the aim is to ensure the creation of a common judicial area and to decide matters on the behest, for example, of parents. And it may not always be of parents but it will usually be of parents because they choose a country within the EU to look at questions regarding their parental responsibility of a child that's living outside the EU is not in keeping with that aim."
p3,00:47:44.080,00:47:48.490,spk_2,Do you accept that? The second last sentence of that paragraph on page 45.
p3,00:47:48.500,00:48:09.830,spk_0,"No, I don't because I say throughout the third state means a state of the Union. Member state of the Union. But even if it did, I would say that it is not in keeping with the aim of the regulation and that's not what's meant by it. Therefore, that's not what's meant by it."
p3,00:48:09.950,00:48:17.690,spk_4,"So, your position is, first of all, that it doesn't mean a non-member state, but that if it is, it's wrong."
p3,00:48:18.070,00:48:28.400,spk_0,"No sorry, my Lord, that -- I mean what I'm saying is that the third state there means what I have argued throughout that it said."
p3,00:48:28.770,00:48:35.900,spk_5,"But the difficulty of that is the first sentence doesn't really make sense on that basis, does it? The first sentence of the last paragraph."
p3,00:48:39.570,00:48:40.200,spk_0,Well --
p3,00:48:40.970,00:48:43.060,spk_3,It doesn't say the member state in question.
p3,00:48:43.060,00:48:45.140,spk_0,"-- I say that no, it doesn't."
p3,00:48:45.190,00:48:46.490,spk_3,It says a member state.
p3,00:48:48.170,00:48:55.670,spk_0,"I say that it does make sense because you may well be dealing with more than two states, and often could be dealing --"
p3,00:48:55.770,00:49:21.280,spk_5,"I'm just focusing on the language and I can see that the law could be different. And the difficulty about the last sentence of the previous paragraph is that the question we're on is part of the analysis of what the competent court is. So, if your argument is wrong, then there's nothing inconsistent with the last sentence of the previous paragraph."
p3,00:49:22.470,00:49:22.790,spk_0,Well --
p3,00:49:22.800,00:49:26.450,spk_5,It's just that the notion of the competent court is rather wider than you would have it be.
p3,00:49:30.570,00:50:01.140,spk_0,"Yes, but what the question that's being answered is, Does the case concern the recognition of -- Sorry, does the case concern the recognition and or enforcement of a decision issued by a court in another member state? And so I say that that means that third state is talking about a member state because it's answering that question within the context of the guidance."
p3,00:50:01.260,00:50:19.440,spk_4,"Why on Earth would they use the expression third state as opposed to another member state? As my Lady pointed out, the indefinite Article qualifies member state the territory of a member state. But it applies also with the habitual residence if the child is in a third state. If that is --"
p3,00:50:19.850,00:50:21.200,spk_0,"It's to do, sorry -- If that is designed"
p3,00:50:21.210,00:50:27.390,spk_4,"identify another member state, it's an extraordinarily bizarre way of doing so,"
p3,00:50:27.390,00:50:27.780,spk_5,isn't it?
p3,00:50:28.360,00:50:42.500,spk_0,"Well, not my Lord, if you accept what I'm saying, that it will often be more than one -- More than two states, or it certainly has to allow for that possibility when one considers --"
p3,00:50:42.510,00:50:45.690,spk_4,It's a numerical argument in this case. Yes.
p3,00:50:46.860,00:50:47.890,spk_2,Well.
p3,00:50:48.640,00:50:49.010,spk_3,Shall I move on?
p3,00:50:49.010,00:50:51.180,spk_2,We've covered the ground fairly thoroughly now.
p3,00:50:52.410,00:50:53.230,spk_0,I'll move

p3,00:56:23.280,00:56:23.420,spk_1,the

p3,00:56:26.030,00:56:26.640,spk_2,What about that --
p3,00:56:26.650,00:56:36.540,spk_0,"So, I have to say that we would have to accept on the face of it, he has accepted the jurisdiction of the court. But we would say that that acceptance -- Sorry, My Lord."

p3,00:56:44.090,00:56:47.700,spk_0,When he filed the document that I'm referring to.
p3,00:56:47.710,00:56:50.050,spk_2,"Well, his application, wasn't it, to set aside --"
p3,00:56:50.830,00:56:51.270,spk_0,His

p3,00:56:59.940,00:57:01.950,spk_4,So I was correct in saying the application was to set aside the undertaking.

p3,00:57:12.930,00:57:13.500,spk_3,It doesn't say that in the document. I'm sorry.
p3,00:57:18.430,00:57:22.250,spk_1,
p3,00:57:25.030,00:57:28.150,spk_5,What is the date at which we're testing these questions?
p3,00:57:29.530,00:57:30.480,spk_1,We were testing
p3,00:57:30.480,00:57:39.440,spk_0,them from the beginning of the proceedings which started on the 31st of October 2007.
p3,00:57:39.450,00:57:39.850,spk_2,Yes.
p3,00:57:41.330,00:57:43.880,spk_0,And I have to accept and I do accept --
p3,00:57:43.890,00:57:51.740,spk_5,I'm sorry. We're testing it as at the 31st of October. How is what happens after that relevant?
p3,00:57:53.530,00:58:11.820,spk_0,"Well, he wasn't there on the 31st of October. So, it's impossible to say that he accepted the jurisdiction of the court. He wasn't even at court on the 31st. That's why there's an order saying he's to attend court."
p3,00:58:12.490,00:58:26.880,spk_5,"The reason I ask is I suppose that depends on what is meant by at the time the court is seized. But if at the time the court is seized means first seized, then we would be poking only would be on the date on the --"
p3,00:58:26.890,00:58:28.250,spk_0,"Well, the court may be"
p3,00:58:28.620,00:58:29.040,spk_3,
p3,00:58:29.490,00:58:38.870,spk_0,seized with the matter as soon as documents are filed. That does not imply unequivocal acceptance does it?
p3,00:58:38.880,00:58:47.030,spk_5,"I wasn't suggesting it is. I'm just trying to find out. Well, first of all, what is your case on at the time the court is seized in little (b)?"
p3,00:58:48.120,00:58:51.430,spk_0,"Well, I'm saying he didn't accept."
p3,00:58:51.430,00:59:07.840,spk_5,"I'm just asking -- first of all, I'm just asking what your case is on the construction of Paragraph 3(b) as to the meaning of the expression at the time the court is seized because that is the critical time for the deciding whether or not there's an unequivocal acceptance, isn't that right?"
p3,00:59:08.920,00:59:33.410,spk_0,"Well, I would say it was when both parties -- It has to be when both parties have had an opportunity to express their acceptance, unequivocal or otherwise, so that the case that it would be the first time that the court has had the party is seized of the matter in the sense that the case has begun because papers have been filed."
p3,00:59:33.410,00:59:34.450,spk_5,So when was that?
p3,00:59:34.820,00:59:45.740,spk_0,"Well, the first time that he attended was the first hearing after the 31st of October and I think --"
p3,00:59:45.750,00:59:47.580,spk_3,It was on the 5th of November.
p3,00:59:47.580,00:59:48.080,spk_0,Yes.
p3,00:59:48.950,01:00:04.740,spk_3,"The order made is on the behind tab 29. And that adjourned it to conciliation hearing, which he attended. And that conciliation hearing resulted in"

p3,01:00:07.180,01:00:12.140,spk_3,conciliated order. And at
p3,01:00:12.140,01:00:19.770,spk_0,the time I would say that his acceptance was not equivocal -- was not unequivocal --
p3,01:00:20.190,01:00:34.100,spk_5,"Just this prior question. I'm just quite anxious to get quite clear in my mind what your cases on the prior question. Are you saying that -- I do accept, for example, that there is a moment at which the time, only one moment --"
p3,01:00:34.110,01:00:43.140,spk_0,"No, I don't. I don't accept that. I don't think that it would be possible to hold parties, particularly parties who have difficulty"
p3,01:00:43.140,01:00:44.600,spk_1,with language
p3,01:00:44.610,01:00:53.310,spk_0,and who are in person as being or having unequivocally --
p3,01:00:53.320,01:01:41.500,spk_5,"That's a different point as to -- I'm just trying to find out what is meant by the word at the time the court is seized in paragraph Article 12 Paragraph 3(b). There are two possibilities as I see it. One is that it identifies a moment. I see. There's scope for argument as to when that moment is. A second theoretical possibility is, at least, that it encompasses the whole of the time over which the court is seized in which case an unequivocal agreement at any time during that whole period would presumably be sufficient. But the case on the other side, I think, is that at the time the court is seized identifies a moment. So, in order to -- First question therefore is you accept that we are looking for a whether --"
p3,01:01:41.500,01:01:44.650,spk_0,"No, I don't accept that we're looking for a moment."
p3,01:01:44.650,01:02:02.110,spk_5,"In which case, your case is then is it that your case is that if there's an unequivocal agreement at any time during the whole period during which the court is seized, then that would be sufficient for Article 53 12(3)(b), is that right?"
p3,01:02:02.600,01:03:23.640,spk_0,"I'm saying that the court has to look -- Once the court is seized of the matter at the beginning, which is in the sense when the proceedings were started in favour of the matter is filed, the court is seized of it then, but the court continues to be seized with it. And there are two reasons why I'm saying that one has to look at the continuance of the seizing of the court. The first is that one cannot glean unequivocal acceptance unless it's expressly made and that's something that I'm going to have to deal with separately. And also, because it says all the parties and it is very common, certainly in children cases, for children to become involved if there have been, for example, public law cases in the background such as there are here. And it is those kind of cases where there would be children living in non-European Union countries as well. Those are the kind of cases that we're looking at within the context of this case."
p3,01:03:23.680,01:03:31.730,spk_2,Does that mean that the court can't know or can't determine whether it has jurisdiction until the child is before it?
p3,01:03:31.730,01:03:52.610,spk_0,"I think the court has to be able to revisit the question of jurisdiction within the context of 12(3). So, for example, if all the parties at the beginning of the case are the mother and the father"
p3,01:03:54.000,01:03:54.230,spk_1,but
p3,01:03:54.230,01:04:11.710,spk_0,"it's clear that the child could or should become involved, it cannot be right that the court itself is not able to revisit the question of jurisdiction considering --"
p3,01:04:11.850,01:04:27.010,spk_4,I wonder if I may just ask you something about that. Does that mean that if the parties understand the implications and unequivocally give their consent to jurisdiction that the court then has jurisdiction?
p3,01:04:27.390,01:04:31.410,spk_0,"The court has jurisdiction, but it can revisit the question."
p3,01:04:31.990,01:04:33.800,spk_4,"But when you say, revisit the question --"
p3,01:04:33.810,01:04:34.620,spk_0,On the basis --
p3,01:04:34.630,01:04:45.530,spk_4,"If a further party to the proceedings intimates a lack of consent, do you suggest that the court thereby loses jurisdiction?"
p3,01:04:45.770,01:04:46.870,spk_0,"Yes, I do. I see."
p3,01:04:47.060,01:04:47.600,spk_4,"So,"
p3,01:04:47.600,01:04:56.980,spk_2,"this is a separate point from the point you already made about best interests? Because that third hurdle, you say, is open to review when the child becomes a party."
p3,01:04:57.280,01:05:24.430,spk_0,"I say that it's part of that because it's based on what is said in Article 3(b),The jurisdiction of the courts has been expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all parties to the proceedings. And at the time this court has seized, I'm saying is the continuance of the case and is in the best interests of the child."
p3,01:05:24.440,01:05:26.810,spk_5,How does that fit in with Article 19(2)?
p3,01:05:27.590,01:05:28.660,spk_0,That's hearing
p3,01:05:28.660,01:05:29.930,spk_1,what the
p3,01:05:29.930,01:05:32.730,spk_0,"child has to say. And I'm sorry, I beg your pardon, 19(2) --"
p3,01:05:40.590,01:05:40.910,spk_3,[Background noise].
p3,01:05:48.690,01:06:00.000,spk_0,I don't think it conflicts with Article 19(2).
p3,01:06:01.680,01:06:07.210,spk_6,"Well, it definitely has the concept of a moment in time when the court is seized."
p3,01:06:07.580,01:06:11.950,spk_0,"Yes, I -- Can I also just ask why --"
p3,01:06:11.960,01:06:14.840,spk_5,"Yes, I say that it does and I -- So do many provisions of the Brussels Conventions [crosstalk] --"
p3,01:06:14.980,01:06:15.820,spk_2,So does
p3,01:06:16.770,01:06:17.580,spk_3,Article 16.
p3,01:06:17.590,01:06:23.490,spk_2,16 is giving you some kind of guidance to what it meant and it's looking at a particular events.
p3,01:06:24.980,01:06:27.800,spk_3,"Well, you have to say something else as well, don't you?"
p3,01:06:28.380,01:06:28.600,spk_0,As
p3,01:06:28.600,01:06:29.380,spk_3,well as this time
p3,01:06:29.380,01:06:30.090,spk_0,"point,"
p3,01:06:30.780,01:06:44.800,spk_3,"you also have to say that, well, you -- Sorry. You may not have to say it, but you may wish to say it, that even if somebody has given their consent, they can later withdraw it."
p3,01:06:46.680,01:06:53.550,spk_0,"Well, I think that that would be a proportionate act to be able to follow through. And the other thing that I think --"
p3,01:06:53.550,01:07:11.200,spk_3,"Otherwise you've got this problem? Yes, indeed. That on legal advice, expressly, your client submitted to the jurisdiction. So, you have either to say, well that doesn't mean what it says or you have to say that he's entitled to withdraw that."
p3,01:07:11.680,01:07:22.550,spk_0,"I think that he is. I mean he expressly said that Brussels II didn't apply but that's, perhaps, not a very attractive argument because he, at the same time, accepted it."
p3,01:07:23.380,01:07:25.120,spk_4,"Within jurisdiction. Yes,"
p3,01:07:25.120,01:07:25.700,spk_0,quite.
p3,01:07:27.160,01:07:38.380,spk_4,"I think your answer to the moment in time point may be, if I've understood your argument correctly, yes, there is a moment in time, but a second moment comes along when the child becomes involved."
p3,01:07:38.380,01:07:39.450,spk_3,I think that that must
p3,01:07:39.460,01:07:56.690,spk_0,"be right. I think that it's right because it's proportionate and I think it's in keeping with what they say, what is said at Preamble 19, which is that what the child has to say is important. I mean, I'm paraphrasing, obviously."
p3,01:07:56.690,01:08:02.990,spk_4,What becomes of the orders that the court have made while it has jurisdiction? Are they still effective?
p3,01:08:05.870,01:08:14.670,spk_0,Is my Lord worry -- Concerned about the orders that were made in the first place in this particular case or just generally?
p3,01:08:14.670,01:08:15.890,spk_2,I'm
p3,01:08:15.890,01:08:21.410,spk_4,not too worried about either. I just want to know what your view is.
p3,01:08:22.270,01:08:22.770,spk_1,I think
p3,01:08:22.770,01:08:37.000,spk_0,"it would have the orders that were in existence. Say if the child's representative or perhaps the child's carer and child themselves became parties to the proceeding and said,"
p3,01:08:37.069,01:08:37.850,spk_1,We don't want the
p3,01:08:37.850,01:09:01.580,spk_0,"case to be heard here. We don't accept this. We are a party. All the parties have not given their unequivocal acceptance, which is what they would be saying. The previous orders would no longer be enforced because the whole case would have to be dealt with in the jurisdiction of the child's habitual residence."
p3,01:09:01.589,01:09:02.150,spk_4,"So, they become a nullity"
p3,01:09:03.359,01:09:04.500,spk_0,in effect.
p3,01:09:04.870,01:09:05.440,spk_2,Even if --
p3,01:09:05.440,01:09:18.920,spk_0,"But in this case, the orders that originally were made when the child was removed to Pakistan. But of course, made under completely different circumstances because the child --"
p3,01:09:19.310,01:09:33.250,spk_2,"You're saying that the orders, the previous orders, on the hypothesis has put to you would be banalities. And that's even if there had been unequivocal express acceptance of jurisdiction by the parents."
p3,01:09:33.250,01:09:42.710,spk_0,"Well, yes. I mean it's no more stringent than saying that the child and or a carer would"
p3,01:09:42.720,01:09:43.920,spk_3,be bound by the
p3,01:09:43.920,01:09:50.600,spk_0,jurisdiction because the parents had chosen and they happened to come along later.
p3,01:09:52.670,01:10:01.750,spk_2,Anyway your position is described as the first part of the situation is concerned. This isn't a case of --
p3,01:10:01.760,01:10:02.730,spk_0,Unequivocal acceptance.
p3,01:10:03.390,01:10:07.880,spk_2,"Either expressed or otherwise in an unequivocal manner. So you say, actuall,y"
p3,01:10:08.040,01:10:08.920,spk_0,that the test was
p3,01:10:08.920,01:10:11.200,spk_2,never satisfied anyway. Is that your position?
p3,01:10:11.200,01:11:24.790,spk_0,"Yes, that is my position. And I'm saying that first of all, I rely on and I have no argument with the analysis by Lord Justice Thorpe in the sense that the court has to look at the continuum of seizure because there are times when it would be and I can absolutely, accept that it would be disproportionate and against any suggestion in any part of this regulation that one could change one's mind in a capricious manner regarding jurisdiction, having accepted it in the first place. But if there is good reason to say I no longer have acceptance of this or it is clear that the person never consented because of their behaviour throughout, then it must be open to the court to say we no longer have jurisdiction or we accept that we don't have jurisdiction. That is a proportionate way to deal with people which is"
p3,01:11:24.800,01:11:25.890,spk_5,after all
p3,01:11:25.890,01:11:27.140,spk_0,what we're dealing with.
p3,01:11:27.140,01:11:37.450,spk_5,One can see that could undoubtedly be the position. And that might be a perfectly coherent law. The question is whether it's the law identified by the draftsman of these regulation.
p3,01:11:37.580,01:11:39.210,spk_0,"Well, I say it is."
p3,01:11:39.310,01:12:29.170,spk_5,"There are various alternative ways of looking at it depending on which of your various submissions we accept. Suppose for a moment we accept the view that the court is seized at the moment of the moment identified in Article 16 which is at the time when the document instituting the proceedings is launched with the court. Now in that analysis, assuming that there is  nothing occurred prior to 2007, assuming we don't have regard in some way to the care proceedings and it strikes me that the European Court might not look at it as narrow, instead they might look at all these proceedings together for this purpose. I don't know. But let's assume we were just looking at in a national way and the proceedings we're looking at are the ones that began on October 2007."
p3,01:12:29.550,01:12:30.380,spk_0,Yes.
p3,01:12:30.480,01:12:38.660,spk_5,Now then the moment under Article 16 would be when? it would be either then would it or the date identified by --
p3,01:12:38.760,01:12:46.800,spk_0,At the time the documents instituted the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court. Is that what my Lord is referring to? Yes.
p3,01:12:49.080,01:12:51.170,spk_5,"That would be October 2007, would it?"
p3,01:12:52.550,01:12:57.770,spk_0,That's when the court is first seized in the
p3,01:12:57.770,01:12:58.730,spk_3,sense that the
p3,01:12:58.740,01:13:03.510,spk_0,"documents are filed, but it does not cover acceptance it doesn't -- I'm not on acceptance."
p3,01:13:03.510,01:13:04.080,spk_3,
p3,01:13:04.840,01:13:49.670,spk_5,"I'm on the moment of seizing. On the hypothesis that on the true construction of the Article, we're looking for a single moment. I know you don't accept that. But assuming that we are correct, contrary to your argument, then we need to identify what that moment is. The moment is that identified as I see it, speaking entirely for myself, by Article 16. So, we have to look at the moment when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court. And that was in 31st of October 2007 or maybe a day or two later. So, on that hypothesis, we will be focusing would be only on the question whether there had been an acceptance."
p3,01:13:50.450,01:13:51.700,spk_0,At that time.
p3,01:13:51.710,01:14:05.840,spk_5,"At that time, and only at that time. And anything that happens subsequently would be irrelevant. So, for jurisdiction to be identified at that moment the agreement has to be made at"
p3,01:14:05.850,01:14:06.740,spk_0,that moment. At that moment.
p3,01:14:06.740,01:14:07.960,spk_5,And what is the evidence about that?
p3,01:14:08.640,01:14:10.670,spk_0,"There is no agreement, nothing."
p3,01:14:10.680,01:14:15.660,spk_6,That's why in Bush and Bush and the Court of Appeal said that paradigm case was prior agreement.
p3,01:14:17.320,01:14:45.270,spk_0,"Express paradigm. Expressly. So the documents are lodged, you know, very sort of looking at it the most practical way, the documents are lodged including a document that says, you know, Mr and Mrs X expressly accept the jurisdiction. Or, you know, this is the jurisdiction they want to be used which is more in keeping with Article 12."
p3,01:14:46.540,01:14:53.330,spk_5,So is there any evidence -- let's assume for the moment that the parties to the proceedings are only the parents.
p3,01:14:53.330,01:14:53.800,spk_0,Yes.
p3,01:14:54.520,01:15:05.760,spk_5,Is there any evidence that they had at that moment expressly accepted in an unequivocal or any other manner the jurisdiction of the court?
p3,01:15:06.140,01:15:07.320,spk_0,No. Not in this case.
p3,01:15:07.380,01:15:12.560,spk_4,"Yes but seizing and jurisdiction don't necessarily have to be a simultaneous events, do they?"
p3,01:15:14.240,01:15:22.270,spk_0,"Well, no, because it's open to parties to come along after a case is filed and say, in many instances."
p3,01:15:23.040,01:15:24.050,spk_5,That's true. But this jurisdiction --
p3,01:15:24.050,01:15:25.460,spk_0,That you don't have jurisdiction. That's
p3,01:15:25.460,01:15:34.850,spk_5,true. But this jurisdiction depends upon the mother bringing the matter within Article 12(3(b).
p3,01:15:34.860,01:15:36.510,spk_0,"Yes, it does. So,"
p3,01:15:36.510,01:15:40.810,spk_5,they've got to show an unequivocal agreement at that moment. Which there wasn't.
p3,01:15:41.460,01:16:03.340,spk_4,"Well, do they? The court can be seized of the proceedings under Article 16 and then under Article 12(3)(b) surely if both parties come to the court on foot of summons or whatever, and both submit to the jurisdiction that will satisfied 12(3)(b) won't it?"
p3,01:16:05.330,01:16:07.950,spk_0,But that is a different time from the time My Lord is saying.
p3,01:16:08.770,01:16:12.730,spk_4,I do recognise that it's a different time I'm asking the question --
p3,01:16:13.260,01:16:14.270,spk_0,"My point is,"
p3,01:16:14.880,01:16:40.990,spk_5,"it's at the time the court is seized the agreement has to be -- Shall we read it? The jurisdiction of the courts has been accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties at the time the court is seized. But that is an identified moment, namely October 2007. Then that is the moment at which the person, a certain jurisdiction, has to show the agreement."
p3,01:16:41.000,01:17:33.980,spk_2,"But how is the court to know? I'm not an expert in these proceedings, but you have the initial application which is the Article 16 point. But if I was a judge, I would need to know what the other party's position was. Of course you would. And so there has to be some further step. It may be, in response to the initial application, the tendering of the unequivocal agreement. Or but the Article refers to, not accepted expressly, but otherwise in an unequivocal manner. So, it's not tying the situation inevitably to a written acceptance, which would be quite unreal to tie it to that. So you are entitled to look at acting's. And I would have thought that the paradigm case of acting's would be the response you get from the other party to the application. The difficulty"
p3,01:17:33.980,01:17:44.900,spk_5,"about that is, with respect, that [inaudible] it is too late. And then if you want to -- You've got to get your agreement before the court is seized. And if you don't do that, there's no jurisdiction."
p3,01:17:44.910,01:18:04.950,spk_4,"That would be the argument. If you substitute moment for time, I could understand that argument. But surely the purpose of interpretation of the Article must mean that the court has an opportunity to investigate the question of whether there has been a submission to the jurisdiction."
p3,01:18:05.030,01:18:19.460,spk_5,"That was why I was asking a question on the hypothesis to identify a moment. I quite see that if it is a continuum of time, and that is it means at any time during the whole period that the court is seized, then you'll get a different result."
p3,01:18:19.470,01:19:26.270,spk_2,"There is a third alternative if I may respectfully say so, and that is that the continuum of time until it has become clear what the party's position is. And that, I would have thought in the common law position, would be the way you address issues of jurisdiction. If in an ordinary action outside this particular regime, the opposing party comes in, says nothing to the contrary and simply lodges the documents opposing without any kind of protest, you would regard that as an acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court. On the face of it yes, you would. The court has then got both parties before it and is then fully seized if I can inject [inaudible] and everybody knows where they are. Otherwise, while I absolutely understand the precision of Lord Clarke's approach, it does seem to me to be a tying it very narrowly to a situation where parties have got together before the application is made and the applicant can then put in together with the application, attached to it, an express agreement or a narrative that explains why my agreement has been reached."
p3,01:19:26.280,01:19:30.080,spk_0,And there may be situations where that happened.
p3,01:19:30.090,01:19:36.240,spk_2,But it's very unusual if you have a dispute about these kind of issues the parties are going to be able to get into that kind of agreement.
p3,01:19:36.650,01:19:40.110,spk_5,"I quite see that the law could be that, but you'd have to add a gloss, with"
p3,01:19:40.520,01:19:41.000,spk_6,"respect to,"
p3,01:19:41.000,01:19:44.830,spk_5,"My Lord, to Article 13(3)(b)."
p3,01:19:45.880,01:20:03.040,spk_6,"Lord Clarke's way of putting it could be supported on this basis, that there are two principle forms of jurisdiction under this regulation. Habitual residence of the child at the time the court is seized"
p3,01:20:03.410,01:20:04.630,spk_1,
p3,01:20:04.640,01:20:24.430,spk_6,"and matrimonial proceedings as the principal ones. This is a rather exceptional one. And where the child is not habitually resident, we want an agreement from the parents and not merely just participating in proceedings."
p3,01:20:24.440,01:20:31.890,spk_0,"We want an unambiguous to use another word, an unambiguous but a similar word."
p3,01:20:32.110,01:20:35.670,spk_6,"And it's supported by the expression at the time, which is used twice, it's used"
p3,01:20:35.670,01:20:35.830,spk_5,in

p3,01:20:44.040,01:20:44.740,spk_5,as well.

p3,01:20:55.600,01:20:57.830,spk_6,Which is inconsistent with the continuum.
p3,01:21:00.510,01:21:12.730,spk_3,"There is, of course, a sort of another point which may or may not have anything in it at all, which is that one can distinguish what"

p3,01:21:15.420,01:21:37.040,spk_3,"the state of affairs is at the time from the evidence required to demonstrate it. And if what you have is an application that's made to the court, you may, of course, accompany with it express agreement, a document -- Actually that's not really provided for in the rules -- No, no."
p3,01:21:37.490,01:21:38.030,spk_0,But
p3,01:21:38.510,01:21:40.880,spk_3,statements and things like that are
p3,01:21:40.890,01:21:41.260,spk_5,not
p3,01:21:41.260,01:22:14.290,spk_3,"supposed to be filed along with applications, but no doubt there are ways of getting around that sort of hurdle. But supposing that you're not limited to an express agreement filed with the court at the time as the only evidence that's acceptable of this acceptance, you could draw inferences from the reaction of the other party to the official document. If that person comes along and participates in proceedings, that may indicate, that may be very good evidence of his acceptance."
p3,01:22:14.300,01:22:19.100,spk_5,It would have to be evidence of a pre-existing acceptance.
p3,01:22:19.110,01:22:27.730,spk_3,"It would have to be evidence -- Forgive me, it would have to be evidence of his acceptance at the time when the application was lodged with the court."
p3,01:22:28.700,01:22:31.240,spk_4,In many cases he'll be unaware of the application.
p3,01:22:31.950,01:22:33.000,spk_6,"Well, he was."
p3,01:22:33.000,01:22:46.910,spk_3,"But were he to know that he would accept it. Anyway, all I was seeking to do is that the requirement and the evidence needed to prove it are two separate things."
p3,01:22:47.880,01:23:07.410,spk_6,"It would be [inaudible] in a case of this type where both parents are resident here to require a separate unequivocal acceptance of jurisdiction by somebody who's here in any event and will have thought that he is subject to the jurisdiction. Yes,"
p3,01:23:08.400,01:23:09.120,spk_1,but
p3,01:23:13.800,01:24:36.770,spk_0,"even if one accepts that the moment that the court has seized is the moment and one looks at it from that point of view, I would say in this case, there is no evidence that he unequivocally accepted the case. Certainly at the beginning, he wasn't represented the first time that he appeared at court. It was in person and his use of language is very limited and to impute acceptance at that point when the court is at where it becomes fully seized. I know that that's not correct terminology, really. But to impute that at the first opportunity, at the first time that the court had to assess acceptance, would be wrong. The first time that they had to assess acceptance if one is looking at the first point in time is when both parties appeared before the court unrepresented and Mr I had no interpreter. And so you couldn't say that it was an unequivocal acceptance and that was the first opportunity that the court had to assess that situation. But if you take -- Sorry. It"
p3,01:24:37.280,01:24:37.950,spk_6,would go
p3,01:24:37.950,01:24:41.060,spk_2,"forward to the conciliation hearing when he did have an interpreter, would it?"
p3,01:24:41.890,01:24:42.700,spk_5,But
p3,01:24:43.790,01:25:14.020,spk_0,"even then, I think the acceptance of jurisdiction surely the unequivocal, unambiguous, acceptance of jurisdiction has to be more than having an interpreter. One has to have had an opportunity to consider it with somebody who may or may not know about the limits of jurisdiction and what is in the best interests of their client as far as jurisdiction goes."
p3,01:25:17.090,01:25:18.290,spk_1,
p3,01:25:19.090,01:25:20.180,spk_3,And I have to say right at the
p3,01:25:20.560,01:25:21.060,spk_2,very
p3,01:25:21.060,01:25:22.440,spk_0,beginning -- I'm
p3,01:25:22.440,01:25:50.320,spk_2,"just trying to see this procedure can actually work. The ideal situation would be if, I know that if learned friends are right and particularly what Collins said in Bush, if the paradigm case is an express agreement which would be entered into before the application is made, I would have thought that the proper course to follow, the correct practise would be for that agreement to be tendered together with the application at the outset, and parties would be told that that was what was expected of them."
p3,01:25:50.320,01:25:51.730,spk_0,I'm sorry? Then there could be no argument.
p3,01:25:51.730,01:26:17.250,spk_2,"Absolutely so. But the form, I don't think, tells the parties that that's what they have to do. It's perhaps a pity that they're not alerted to that. But it could be that the applicant could either, if there was a form, would be expected to lodge it together with the application or alternatively, set out in the application the facts which she says or he says demonstrate the unequivocal agreement."
p3,01:26:17.980,01:26:18.700,spk_3,"Well, I think if"
p3,01:26:18.710,01:27:02.500,spk_0,"my Lords decide that Brussels II does apply to cases where children are not resident in this country, people will be quite quick to develop such a way of dealing with the case. But we're not dealing with that here. We're dealing with the situation where that kind of provision wasn't made and where I say that the first respondent cannot have been said whether he attended at court and spoke to the conciliator and the order was made by conciliation. And of course, My Lords and My Lady will be very well aware that at conciliation appointments the orders can only be made if by consent."
p3,01:27:03.880,01:27:04.370,spk_3,The whole thing
p3,01:27:04.370,01:27:10.810,spk_2,"is so unreal. I'm sorry, I interrupted you again because nobody applied their minds to Brussels II at all at the time we're talking about."
p3,01:27:11.380,01:27:12.460,spk_3,"Well, that's"
p3,01:27:12.460,01:27:13.520,spk_5,the difficulty
p3,01:27:13.520,01:27:14.330,spk_3,with having
p3,01:27:14.340,01:28:22.180,spk_0,"the seizure at the first moment that the court has the case in front of it with the documents and both parties. Unless there is an absolute unequivocal, Yes, we both want this. It's not just enough to say, Well you know I'm here. There it has to be unequivocal is  says that. Unambiguous. It means that. And so in the face of this case, it wasn't there at the first opportunity because the only other way of imputing it would be to say later on after he had been to court several times and his counsel filed a document expressly accepting jurisdiction, that's when it's accepted. But that doesn't fit in with the provisions of the regulations, My Lords and My Lady."
p3,01:28:28.170,01:28:28.590,spk_5,
p3,01:28:29.270,01:28:30.650,spk_2,Yes.
p3,01:28:30.650,01:28:35.580,spk_0,There would have to be some real indication of willingness.
p3,01:28:36.400,01:28:36.740,spk_1,If
p3,01:28:36.740,01:28:40.440,spk_0,you take the first moment of time being when both parties are before the court --
p3,01:28:40.440,01:28:58.780,spk_5,"And I suppose your best point really, assuming that we do take one moment of time contrary to your primary submission, if one looks at the other side's argument about the unequivocal acceptance. All the events are post November 2007. Almost."
p3,01:28:58.780,01:29:48.670,spk_0,"Well, most of them. Most of them are. But if you don't take -- My other argument, of course, is that I would say he never unambiguously accepted jurisdiction even in the face of his document. But that, of course, doesn't fit in with My Lords point about when the court is first seized and the moment of time. And then there's the argument and I would say it's a live argument, about a party coming along and the court being seized of a case that now has three parties or being seized of a case that now has four parties. That's a moment of time when that case, even though it's a case that's already in existence."
p3,01:29:50.070,01:30:00.690,spk_6,The father's application in 2003 made under Section 13 was --
p3,01:30:01.060,01:30:02.380,spk_0,2003. Sorry My Lord.
p3,01:30:02.730,01:30:05.290,spk_6,"Yes, the permission to remove."
p3,01:30:05.660,01:30:06.540,spk_0,"Oh, yes."
p3,01:30:07.760,01:30:11.080,spk_6,"That was made under Section 13, but is it still"
p3,01:30:11.860,01:30:12.200,spk_1,
p3,01:30:12.200,01:30:16.140,spk_6,"a Section 8? It's still a Section 8 order, isn't it?"
p3,01:30:16.150,01:30:18.740,spk_0,They made a Section 8 order and it would always be a Section 8.
p3,01:30:18.740,01:30:23.410,spk_6,And the mother's application in 2007 was also a Section 8.
p3,01:30:23.420,01:30:31.370,spk_0,"Yes, and that would be within private law proceedings as opposed to specified public law."
p3,01:30:31.380,01:30:38.880,spk_6,Isn't it rather artificial to regard those as two separate proceedings if they are in relation to the same child? They may have different numbers on.
p3,01:30:41.160,01:30:41.690,spk_0,"Well,"
p3,01:30:42.160,01:30:42.360,spk_6,
p3,01:30:43.760,01:30:57.480,spk_0,I don't think so. I don't think it's artificial. The circumstances are completely different. The child's living in a different place with different people that are intended to be the permanent carers of this child. It's difficult.
p3,01:30:58.360,01:30:59.060,spk_3,It is a
p3,01:30:59.070,01:31:00.500,spk_0,different case.
p3,01:31:00.510,01:31:28.640,spk_3,"Isn't it difficult? Because obviously once a child's future has been put before the courts and orders made, in a sense, there is always the continuing power to vary those orders to substitute for new orders. It is not the end in the way that civil litigation comes to an end. When the court makes an order, it's unsuccessfully appealed, it's enforced and so on. Children's cases are not like"
p3,01:31:28.640,01:31:29.070,spk_1,that.
p3,01:31:29.760,01:31:40.680,spk_3,"But at the same time, the regulation clearly contemplates that there will be discrete pieces of litigation in relation to children. All the jurisdictional"
p3,01:31:42.060,01:31:42.580,spk_0,bits of the
p3,01:31:42.580,01:33:19.690,spk_3,"law accept that so that you can have one set of proceedings about children and then another set of proceedings about children. It's difficult. One can clearly distinguish the care proceedings, which were initiated by the local authority to which the local authority and the child were automatically parties, and which concluded with the making of the residents and supervision orders. Nobody would suggest that the local authority would automatically become a party to any subsequent application made to vary or substitute a new residents audit. So, one might suggest that that was a new set of proceedings. Query the father's application which related to the residence order. But obviously, again, I don't suppose he involved the local authority in making that application. I don't suppose he involved -- He wouldn't. Everybody, it is taken for granted, is it not? The guardian ad litem drops out of care proceedings when they are concluded and has to be reappointed if a further applications made within specified proceedings. That's one of the problems. And so the father's application ,although we can argue about whether Section 13 is what it's under, is definitely for a Section 8 order basically and is a new set of proceedings, but is the mother's also a new set of proceedings?"
p3,01:33:19.700,01:33:20.580,spk_0,"Well I would say yes it it. In a way, we've"
p3,01:33:20.590,01:33:24.880,spk_1,"become unreal, [inaudible]."
p3,01:33:25.350,01:33:25.760,spk_0,Cases involving the

p3,01:34:06.640,01:34:07.500,spk_0,I don't think it's in the bundle.
p3,01:34:10.940,01:34:13.870,spk_5,Do we have any of the documents relevant to those proceedings?
p3,01:34:15.060,01:34:15.690,spk_1,"Well, maybe [inaudible]."

p3,01:34:24.160,01:34:29.800,spk_5,is it your case that those proceedings fall within the regulation at

p3,01:34:45.540,01:34:47.460,spk_1,Well -- They can fall within the regulation.

p3,01:34:48.870,01:34:50.650,spk_3,Then why wouldn't they fall within the regulation?

p3,01:34:51.500,01:34:53.460,spk_5,"Well, when did the regulation come into force? We looked at that."
p3,01:34:54.340,01:34:56.890,spk_3,Ah yes that's 2005.
p3,01:34:57.040,01:35:19.340,spk_5,"But can I ask you this question? Let's assume that the regulation had come into force. Would they fall within the regulation? Because we are concerned with what the true construct of this regulation is a more general way. I can quite see the facts of this case, the devil within, somewhat, because of the fact that the regulation only came into force halfway through, as it were."
p3,01:35:20.980,01:35:21.770,spk_3,Right from the

p3,01:35:45.730,01:35:47.700,spk_5,"So, they're private law proceedings."

p3,01:36:01.930,01:36:03.800,spk_3,They would have been covered by the regulation.
p3,01:36:04.390,01:36:13.700,spk_5,On what basis would they be covered by the regulation? I'm assuming it applied. I do take the point it didn't apply.

p3,01:36:15.930,01:36:17.740,spk_5,But maybe the previous regulations applied.
p3,01:36:19.760,01:36:32.290,spk_3,"They would be covered by the general rule in Article 8. The courts of the member states shall have jurisdiction is matters of parental responsibility over a child who is habitually resident in that member state at the time the court is seized.

p3,01:36:39.430,01:36:40.980,spk_5,Did the previous regulation apply?
p3,01:36:41.190,01:36:50.010,spk_0,"No, because it dealt primarily with matters of parents responsibility arising out of matrimonial cases."
p3,01:36:50.020,01:37:11.840,spk_6,"But apart from technicalities of English procedure, how is it that once the court has exercised its powers in matters of parental responsibility on the initiative of the father in allowing the child to go outside your jurisdiction."

p3,01:37:12.670,01:37:26.250,spk_6,"is that looking at it very broadly, not to be treated as the same proceeding in which the mother then subsequently asks for different orders?"

p3,01:39:03.850,01:39:06.440,spk_0,I think it would have to be revisted. And I don't think --
p3,01:39:06.920,01:39:07.540,spk_3,Why?
p3,01:39:10.520,01:39:12.640,spk_0,It would bind the court and the parties until the child reaches the authority for the court to consider.
p3,01:39:13.620,01:39:15.440,spk_1,

p3,01:39:18.800,01:39:19.940,spk_0,I'm very puzzled
p3,01:39:20.520,01:39:21.570,spk_3,because
p3,01:39:21.570,01:40:08.140,spk_6,"the father got the order for permission to remove the child on the basis of an undertaking to return the child to the jurisdiction when ordered to do so, and also made provision for interim of order -- Made for provision for interim contact with the mother. Leading up to the accounts. Yes. So then the child goes abroad. I repeat my question. It may be that under English rules of procedure, you have to start anew. I'm surprised you do, but it seems that the mother has to start some new procedure. But looking at it broadly, they are the same proceedings, aren't they? Yes they are, Absolutely. Looking at it's broadest one couldn't argue otherwise"
p3,01:40:12.110,01:40:12.460,spk_0,it's
p3,01:40:12.460,01:40:13.040,spk_1,"the same child, it's the same hearing."
p3,01:40:14.610,01:40:22.730,spk_4,"Well, I wonder whether one even has to look at it broadly. The order that was made releasing a child contemplated his return"
p3,01:40:23.110,01:40:24.330,spk_6,to
p3,01:40:24.710,01:40:34.780,spk_4,"this country. If required. If required. Well, that in itself has the potential for as you say, revisiting. The court"
p3,01:40:34.790,01:40:35.160,spk_1,can
p3,01:40:35.160,01:40:42.000,spk_4,"be called upon to give effect to the undertaking, require him to implement the undertaking. Yes it can"
p3,01:40:45.210,01:40:47.300,spk_0,but it is not the same as an unequivocal --
p3,01:40:47.310,01:40:49.870,spk_4,"No, no, no, no, no. We're on a different point."
p3,01:40:49.900,01:40:50.870,spk_3,We're on a completely different
p3,01:40:50.870,01:41:17.930,spk_4,"point. This is the question about whether one needs to have a broad approach in order to say that they're same proceedings. And I'm positing with you that perhaps you don't even have to have a broad approach. That these proceedings carry within them the potential for further applications. And it may have a different record number. It may involve making a new application. But essentially, it's the same proceeding."
p3,01:41:19.410,01:41:37.830,spk_3,"It may be that one of the most important points in this case, as far as practise is concerned, is what is the continuing effect of an undertaking such as that given by the father in a case such as this, which is something about which I have been worried for a very long time."
p3,01:41:39.110,01:41:41.830,spk_0,"I'm afraid that the practise is thrown up particularly to, and"
p3,01:41:44.310,01:41:46.000,spk_3,"this is a complete aside, but"
p3,01:41:46.010,01:41:58.420,spk_1,particularly to encourage consent orders of different institutes such as these to accept the undertakings of jurisdictions where orders can be enforced. The question is whether that's the correct way to go about
p3,01:41:59.810,01:42:05.100,spk_0,it but that's the practise.
p3,01:42:06.900,01:42:15.420,spk_5,"So here, if this regulation had been enforced, the original - the jurisdiction would originally have been under Article 8. Originally, yes."
p3,01:42:16.100,01:42:16.370,spk_6,
p3,01:42:16.370,01:43:27.400,spk_5,"Now, there's nothing in the regulations that provides when that jurisdiction ceases. CF Article 12. In Article 12, there is an express provision about when the jurisdiction comes to an end. Now, there is no such provision in relation to Article 8. So, why does not one treat all the - why would not if the Article applied, why would not the European court at least, treat, for purposes of the regulation, treat all everything that has happened subsequently as part of the proceedings, which began when the first Article 8 proceedings began. Because they all relate to the parental responsibility in relation to the child. The child had its habitual residence within the jurisdiction at the time they began. There is nothing in the regulations would suggest that one should have artificial lines. The court would surely be treated, the court of the relevant member state would surely be treated as having seizing of the proceedings until the very"
p3,01:43:27.400,01:43:29.470,spk_3,"end. Miss Russell, can I help"
p3,01:43:29.470,01:43:30.830,spk_1,you?
p3,01:43:31.300,01:43:33.920,spk_3,"Well, sorry yes."
p3,01:43:34.400,01:43:35.540,spk_1,
p3,01:43:35.550,01:43:55.710,spk_3,I merely wish to indicate to you that this was meant to be helpful to you rather than the reverse. People don't always understand which way I mean. Usually I mean nothing at all. I really want to know the answer. But if one looks at Articles 9 and 10.
p3,01:43:56.300,01:43:56.830,spk_0,Yes.
p3,01:43:57.500,01:43:57.730,spk_1,
p3,01:43:58.200,01:44:00.020,spk_3,They provide for
p3,01:44:01.090,01:44:01.380,spk_1,what
p3,01:44:01.380,01:44:14.130,spk_3,"happens when a child moved lawfully from one member state to another. And the plain implication of that, is that jurisdiction, under Article 8, comes to an end, say, in the two"
p3,01:44:14.130,01:44:14.960,spk_0,situations
p3,01:44:14.960,01:44:15.620,spk_3,provided for there.
p3,01:44:15.870,01:44:17.280,spk_0,Yes that's correct in a set period.
p3,01:44:17.280,01:44:19.150,spk_3,"Which would, I think, be the answer to My Lord."
p3,01:44:19.150,01:44:20.450,spk_5,Well.
p3,01:44:20.460,01:44:27.760,spk_3,"However, the regulation doesn't apply. And we're back in Section 2 of the Family Law Act 1986."
p3,01:44:28.190,01:44:57.570,spk_6,"But 9 applies when there aren't proceedings doesn't it? So that a child is habitually resident in England and then goes to France, the English court retains jurisdiction for three months irrespective - it's not talking about the cessation of jurisdiction in existing proceedings."
p3,01:44:57.580,01:44:58.430,spk_0,It
p3,01:44:58.430,01:45:20.910,spk_3,"very - it may, of course, include the situation which you're referring to. But it clearly includes a situation where there's been a judgement about access rights. You retain jurisdiction because you have made an order. That's the circumstance in which you retain jurisdiction. You don't retain it if you haven't so it does contemplate proceedings."
p3,01:45:21.070,01:45:27.910,spk_5,"Although, it doesn't apply to removal to non-member states. Article 9. Article 8 would do --"
p3,01:45:28.590,01:45:28.930,spk_3,Article
p3,01:45:28.930,01:45:30.330,spk_2,9(2) is interesting
p3,01:45:30.650,01:45:31.240,spk_3,for
p3,01:45:31.240,01:45:41.670,spk_2,quite different reasons because it does show a different method of jurisdiction being established is by participating in proceedings without contesting jurisdiction. That's not the
p3,01:45:41.680,01:45:43.420,spk_0,approach of 12(3).
p3,01:45:43.990,01:45:44.810,spk_2,That's not the same.
p3,01:45:44.960,01:46:28.460,spk_5,"My analysis wouldn't involve 12 ready at all. It would simply say well, Article 8 applies and in fact, although Article 9 would apply as My Lady says, it would only apply if the transfer was to another member state. If it's to a non-member states in Article 9 doesn't apply, but that doesn't answer the question whether these are still broadly the same proceedings. Especially in circumstances where one of the questions is whether the father is in breach or might be in breach of his undertaking which he gave to the court in those very proceedings. They're all bound up together, and it's a bit difficult to imagine the ECJ writing a judgment saying these are completely different proceedings because that's not the way they operate. That would be impossible."
p3,01:46:28.460,01:46:33.830,spk_6,What's the effect that the regulation only came into force in March 2005? Clearly doesn't apply unless
p3,01:46:37.410,01:46:39.100,spk_0,it's retrospective.
p3,01:46:39.140,01:46:40.300,spk_2,Which doesn't apply?
p3,01:46:41.080,01:46:45.420,spk_0,The regulation can't apply because it wasn't in force at the time.
p3,01:46:45.430,01:46:49.510,spk_2,"What about an agreement? Again if you haven't expressed written agreement, signed and witnessed all that why couldn't you apply?"
p3,01:46:50.620,01:46:54.080,spk_0,I think that it has to apply to the regulation.
p3,01:46:54.080,01:47:01.410,spk_3,"But the courts got jurisdiction anyway it doesn't need agreement to give it jurisdiction, the child is habitually resident here at that point."
p3,01:47:01.420,01:47:01.980,spk_0,At that
p3,01:47:01.980,01:47:23.270,spk_3,point. At that point. And so whoever decided to put the former version of the Family Law Act 1986 in our bundles was obviously prescient. They realised that My Lords were going to raise this very issue so that we could look at what the situation was in 19 - in 2004.
p3,01:47:24.980,01:47:25.310,spk_0,
p3,01:47:27.080,01:47:30.500,spk_4,Prescient without necessarily knowing it.
p3,01:47:31.670,01:47:35.010,spk_5,Unequivocally. It's very puzzling.
p3,01:47:35.220,01:47:37.610,spk_2,"Well, where do we go from here Miss Russell?"
p3,01:47:37.610,01:47:38.580,spk_3,
p3,01:47:38.580,01:47:39.900,spk_0,"I'm sorry, My Lord."
p3,01:47:40.680,01:47:40.820,spk_1,I
p3,01:47:40.820,01:47:59.450,spk_0,don't know if My Lords - would be helpful to My Lords if I continued with the question of equivocation regarding consent because of what I say my client's position was or if it would be more helpful if we left that topic and moved on to something else.
p3,01:47:59.450,01:48:09.640,spk_2,"I'm open to what everybody else thinks. I think probably you can move on and if we feel we need to come back to it, we can come back to it. But I think we should move on to the next chapter."
p3,01:48:10.770,01:48:20.790,spk_0,"Thank you very much. The next chapter that I would like to move on to, if I can, is in relation to the child's interests."
p3,01:48:21.870,01:48:23.570,spk_2,"Yes, best interests."
p3,01:48:23.570,01:48:29.030,spk_0,Best interests. And I say that
p3,01:48:29.310,01:48:30.000,spk_1,if
p3,01:48:30.770,01:49:02.760,spk_0,"the regulation applies, then the court has to consider and the court decides that there has been unequivocal acceptance, then the court would have to consider whether or not it was in the best interests of the child to exercise the jurisdiction it says was chosen and accepted by both parents. And in this case, I would suggest that even in the face of the"
p3,01:49:02.770,01:49:03.600,spk_1,evidence
p3,01:49:03.600,01:49:27.150,spk_0,"before the court and there are many issues regarding this case that have not been aired, heard or decided, in fact, at all, since the child was removed from the jurisdiction. Because most of the conflict that's arising between the parties over matters appertaining to contact have not been heard or decided by the court. But even on that --"
p3,01:49:27.160,01:49:32.990,spk_2,"The issue -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but the issue one is looking at is not the full merits investigation. No, no indeed. I'm saying"
p3,01:49:33.930,01:50:23.450,spk_0,"even given that, there is a real case for arguing that it would not be in the best interests of the child and that the court has to consider that. But from the point of view, purely, of whether or not this regulation applies in this case and should apply in these cases, what I'm really saying is whichever court is making the decision about whether the regulation applies, that court would have to investigate whether or not the exercise of the jurisdiction was in the best interests of the child. Having gone through the other hurdles that we have already discussed in some detail. I don't know if there's any dispute about that."
p3,01:50:23.450,01:50:27.790,spk_4,"In other words, a full comprehensive investigation of the best interest."
p3,01:50:28.490,01:50:43.540,spk_0,There would have to be more than just what's on the face of the documents in order for the court to make a proportionate decision about what is in any child's best interests.
p3,01:50:43.600,01:50:46.900,spk_4,But something short of a full hearing.
p3,01:50:48.260,01:50:48.760,spk_6,"Of a full hearing, yes."
p3,01:50:48.770,01:50:53.820,spk_2,What sort of factors would the court be looking at? The court would have to
p3,01:50:53.820,01:52:10.210,spk_0,"consider the effect on the child of a court in this country deciding issues that are principally concerned with another jurisdiction. So there would have to be a look at the balance of how much the court could do that, because it may vary very much if we're just looking at the regulation from the point of view of a regulation. It may be very easy for the court to consider what's in the best interests of a child who is living in France because the factual matrix is easier to ascertain. But to consider the effects of a child who lives in a different country and speaks a different language and although that may be true of France but who is much further away, there's a different cultural matrix, there's no real strong connection because the child has lived so long in another country. Those are the kind of issues that the court would have to consider not in all the detail and certainly not by deciding conflicts between the parents about their behaviour, but within the context of the case."
p3,01:52:10.460,01:52:10.680,spk_2,Well that's forum non
p3,01:52:11.860,01:52:13.770,spk_3,conveniens. [Inaudible].
p3,01:52:13.780,01:52:14.260,spk_0,"Yes, in a way,"
p3,01:52:14.270,01:52:15.070,spk_2,Yes.
p3,01:52:15.750,01:52:29.740,spk_0,"But it's not. It's based on this. It's based on this part, the third part, if I can call it that, of (b) of 12(3) of Article 12(3)."
p3,01:52:29.750,01:52:35.040,spk_3,But the sort of factors one is looking at are the same sort of factors as one is looking at in deciding.
p3,01:52:35.050,01:52:38.630,spk_0,"Well, My Lady, I would say that that's the only way you could possibly"
p3,01:52:38.640,01:52:39.500,spk_3,come
p3,01:52:39.500,01:52:44.240,spk_0,to any kind of decision about what was in a child's best interests.
p3,01:52:44.950,01:52:45.360,spk_4,
p3,01:52:45.850,01:52:52.770,spk_0,"It would not be right, for example, to presume that because the child is living in,"
p3,01:52:53.150,01:52:53.920,spk_1,even
p3,01:52:53.920,01:54:01.110,spk_0,"though Article 12(4) suggest is that because a child is living in a non-Convention non-Hague Convention country ipso facto therefore, it must be in the child's best interest. Best interests are not the same as interest. And there is also the question of the ability of the court to look at questions regarding the child's best interests and how that could be done in a way that is in keeping with that child's best interests. For example, I would say in this case it may not necessarily be, and it's not something I'm asking My Lords or My Lady to make a decision about. But in this case, one may say quite strongly that it can't possibly be in this child's best interest to be brought over to this country to be assessed when in fact he's been living for most of his life with his grandparents in Pakistan, and that's an example. I mean, it would be something"
p3,01:54:01.110,01:54:01.700,spk_1,the court
p3,01:54:01.710,01:54:13.020,spk_0,"would have to look at. And I know, for example, that his guardian feels it wouldn't be, on the face of it, a good idea for him to be brought over in his interests. So those are matters that the court --"
p3,01:54:13.200,01:54:15.770,spk_3,"But of course, there are other ways of handling that problem."
p3,01:54:16.140,01:54:17.210,spk_0,"There are, but --"
p3,01:54:18.040,01:54:31.660,spk_3,"I have plenty of recollection, there are some things I have forgotten, but I have plenty of recollection of handling cases where the welfare inquiries were actually conducted in the case where the child was. And often very satisfactory."
p3,01:54:31.850,01:54:32.210,spk_0,"Yes, indeed."
p3,01:54:32.230,01:54:34.070,spk_3,It got wonderful reports from international social services.
p3,01:54:34.070,01:54:34.990,spk_0,"Yes, indeed."
p3,01:54:36.040,01:54:37.130,spk_3,I'm not saying --
p3,01:54:37.130,01:54:42.160,spk_5,It's only going to be focusing or the court would only be focusing on the issue of jurisdiction.
p3,01:54:42.540,01:54:43.060,spk_1,At this
p3,01:54:43.060,01:54:43.900,spk_0,"stage, it would be, yes."
p3,01:54:44.370,01:55:07.390,spk_5,"Not on whether what would happen at the hearing, where the jurisdiction is being exercised and whether the child should be brought back or not for the purposes of an assessment -- But I think My Lord -- wouldn't be implicit in the jurisdiction question because, as My Lady says, I can understand, it's quite common for material to be obtained in various ways from other parts of"
p3,01:55:07.390,01:55:08.400,spk_1,the world.
p3,01:55:08.410,01:55:33.920,spk_2,"This is where the the Court of Appeal Paragraphs 31 onwards are paragraphs you'd support. Is that not right? You've got Lord Justice Thorpe saying, This child has been in Pakistan for most of half - more than half his life, any decisions are better dealt with in the courts of that region and then he comes on to deal with the Protocol those sort of points. And you're supporting that obviously."
p3,01:55:34.160,01:55:35.650,spk_0,I am supporting that.
p3,01:55:35.890,01:55:36.330,spk_3,And I say
p3,01:55:36.330,01:55:38.460,spk_0,it's something that the court would have to do.
p3,01:55:39.210,01:55:39.520,spk_6,Are you inviting
p3,01:55:39.980,01:55:43.240,spk_5,"us to decide that or are you inviting us to remit it, assuming we were otherwise?"
p3,01:55:43.250,01:55:46.620,spk_0,I'm inviting you to decide it within the context of what you have before you.
p3,01:55:50.840,01:55:55.500,spk_6,"And if you're wrong on third state, then there's not much to be said on this part of the case."
p3,01:55:58.740,01:56:11.250,spk_0,"Well, I'm saying that if you look at this case objectively from the child's point of view, it's not in this child's best interests. It doesn't reflect his interests for the case to be heard here."
p3,01:56:12.030,01:56:15.180,spk_6,"So, you say that you get the same result under 12(4)."
p3,01:56:15.190,01:56:16.250,spk_0,That's what I'm saying.
p3,01:56:17.330,01:56:18.460,spk_6,Yeah.
p3,01:56:20.930,01:56:21.350,spk_1,
p3,01:56:20.930,01:56:21.350,spk_1,"Well,"
p3,01:56:26.180,01:56:29.700,spk_0,the only other matter that I had that I wanted to deal with

p3,01:56:30.890,01:56:47.850,spk_0,"has in fact been dealt with, which was the status of orders. And we had a discussion about that, if I can put it that way. I didn't think it was necessary for me to address you again on that matter, but -- Do you want to hear more on that?"
p3,01:56:48.430,01:56:50.650,spk_2,"No, thank you very much."
p3,01:56:51.630,01:56:53.560,spk_0,Is there anything else that I can?

p3,01:58:06.000,01:58:10.810,spk_5,Yes all of everything else has been the same. Just that the regulation hasn't come into force. What would have been the position?

p3,01:59:34.400,01:59:35.450,spk_3,look at it and think

p3,01:59:39.840,01:59:51.530,spk_0,pertinent points that one would have to consider when looking at the position is that there was no continuing order regarding contact or anything else except the father's undertaking.
p3,01:59:51.540,01:59:52.470,spk_3,So I think
p3,01:59:52.470,01:59:57.400,spk_0,that would have an effect on what the jurisdiction
p3,01:59:57.820,01:59:59.720,spk_5,was. The accept it might be quite a big except though?
p3,01:59:59.730,02:00:05.100,spk_6,The child is still British national. It's still jurisdiction on that basis.
p3,02:00:06.910,02:00:21.230,spk_2,It's my fault. I'd like to be quite sure about dates on this. This point I understand from the statement of facts and issues. The child left this country in the 22nd of December 2004. Is that right? Yes that's right.
p3,02:00:22.590,02:00:23.500,spk_3,And when did the

p3,02:01:45.110,02:04:18.650,spk_1,"Can I at the outset say that there was some discussion yesterday morning about the appointment of the guardian and the appointment of the child as a party. And there was, as I recall, a request perhaps to have sight of Rule 9.5. Lords I have brought copies of that today if they may assist together with a copy of the practise direction from April 2004. You will see in 9.5 paragraph one that it is open to the court if it is in the court's view in the best interests of any child to be made a party to the proceedings to go on and appoint sub paragraph A an officer of the service or a Welsh family proceedings officer, and that would refer in my submission to CAFCASS and that is indeed what happened in this case. My Lords in paragraph five 9.55 it is clear that that person who is appointed is then to be treated as a party for the purpose of those proceedings. Lords the attached practise direction is of relevance in this way, in the sense that at paragraph three it sets out some guidance in respect of the decision to make the child a party. And it refers at paragraph 3.7 to circumstances which I would say called to this case so that where there are international complications outside child abduction, in particular where it may be necessary if they're to be discussions with overseas authorities or a foreign court. So my Lords in my submission, while I acknowledge that it is unusual in many private law proceedings to have the child joined as a party as was indicated yesterday, in cases of this type where you have got non abduction international complications it may well be that it is a more likely occurrence than not."
p3,02:04:18.650,02:04:21.990,spk_3,Was this the practise direction that had to be withdrawn because it was too broad?
p3,02:04:23.190,02:04:26.600,spk_1,I'm not aware that it was withdrawn in it's entirety.
p3,02:04:27.780,02:04:45.220,spk_3,"Or modified or clarified. I'm not suggesting that the particular case has then been taken outside. But my recollection was that a very sensible practise direction was made, and it proved so sensible that CAFCASS couldn't handle"
p3,02:04:45.220,02:04:55.260,spk_1,"it. My Lady that may be right, but my understanding is that still cases with the kind of international complications such as this --"
p3,02:04:55.350,02:05:06.040,spk_3,I'm not denying that for one moment I was merely wanting to get the effect of the actual order that Mr Justice Hedley I think it was wasn't it.
p3,02:05:06.100,02:05:07.110,spk_1,"Yes, it was."
p3,02:05:07.990,02:05:11.060,spk_3,And I think seeing the Rule clarifies it.
p3,02:05:11.070,02:05:55.160,spk_1,"I'm grateful. My Lords, perhaps I can set out the guardian's position in the sense that it is perhaps not at first blush always the clearest. Lords, the guardian was appointed, as we know, in July, although he wasn't actually allocated to this matter until September. And he provided two reports in the proceedings. One in January 2009 and one in May 2009. Lords, they are in the bundle. The Appendix 1 of 43 and 44 respectively. And it --"
p3,02:05:55.170,02:05:57.520,spk_2,"Sorry, I missed the numbers here."
p3,02:05:58.090,02:05:58.770,spk_1,Sorry.
p3,02:05:58.820,02:06:00.390,spk_2,Appendix Part 2?
p3,02:06:00.390,02:06:04.240,spk_1,The large Appendix bundle. At Tab 43 and 44.
p3,02:06:04.240,02:06:06.610,spk_2,"43? Sorry, I beg your pardon. 43 and 44."
p3,02:06:06.610,02:06:14.210,spk_1,Yeah.
p3,02:06:14.780,02:06:15.200,spk_2,
p3,02:06:16.580,02:09:36.860,spk_1,"Of course, the order of Mrs -- Mr Justice Headley had provided for the children's representatives to restore the matter back before the court once the guardian had had time to make some preliminary inquiries. The report was therefore prepared and the matter then, of course, as we know, brought back before the court in the early part of this year. But more to the relevance of that report in my submission is perhaps that at Page 13 it seems that the guardian was the first person, certainly the first party, to seemingly apply his mind to the jurisdiction of the court. He has consistently since that time flagged up with the court his concerns about the jurisdiction. Lords, a position statement filed on his behalf in February was very clear that one of the first questions that the court should be asked to consider was the question of jurisdiction. And that position statement is at Tab 18 again of Appendix 2 as I understand it. Yes. So, it would seem to be clear on the face of the papers that the guardian has consistently raised this concern. He has been seeking the guidance of the court on the matter, and he has sought the guidance of the child's solicitor. He himself was not expressing a personal view, and to some degree, that remains, in terms of the question of jurisdiction, his position. At the hearing in May, before his Honour, Judge Barnett, the child's solicitor argued on his behalf on legal grounds that the court did not have jurisdiction. But My Lords will, of course, have seen that in fact, when it came to arguments of forum non conveniens the guardian, in fact, preferred that the matter be dealt with in this jurisdiction. From that point on, the guardian has taken the view that he was content with that decision of his Honour, Judge Barnett. So, took essentially a neutral stance in the Court of Appeal. He didn't seek to go behind that decision, and the position today is essentially that because he doesn't seek to go behind those decisions, he essentially resists the appeal. But it isn't perhaps at first blush, the most straightforward position."
p3,02:09:37.470,02:09:59.510,spk_2,"I understand from the end of paragraph 14 in your written case that you have a, as it were, a solution. If the decision were to be that jurisdiction was in England that an initial assessment should be carried out in Pakistan. So, you're not saying that it's impossible to live with the decision to that effect?"
p3,02:10:03.960,02:10:05.790,spk_3,"I'm not saying that it's impossible to live with the decision, My Lord, no. And in fact, I also indicate in the written case [inaudible]"
p3,02:10:06.260,02:11:24.190,spk_1,"that despite the various practical difficulties, there are some advantages. And one specific advantage, in his view, to the matter being dealt with in this jurisdiction and that is because he is mindful of the fact that the knob of the application is of contact in this country. And he is also mindful, from his knowledge of the case thus far, that this is a mother who can pose risks, significant risks, to this child. And he, on conducting a balancing exercise, has felt, perhaps, more confident that the courts of this country to be able to place the appropriate safeguards around any contact where it would need to take place. They would, for example, be able to involve, if needs be, the local authority and other resources which may be able to assist."
p3,02:11:24.190,02:11:52.870,spk_3,"It's interesting, is it not, that mother has herself escorted Qadeer back from Pakistan for some of his previous visit here. And I suppose the guardian would say, Well, that is an indication that just possibly some of the protective mechanisms in this jurisdiction ought at least to be under consideration rather than leaving it all to private enterprise, so to speak."
p3,02:11:53.360,02:12:12.600,spk_1,"Indeed, My Lady. The guardian has indicated in his reports that he has, because of the practical difficulties thus far, has found it hard to conduct a meaningful analysis, that nevertheless, because of that and because of the extent to which it would appear that the mother has not been able to move on from that, he is very mindful the risks."
p3,02:12:12.600,02:12:13.070,spk_0,
p3,02:12:14.450,02:12:15.170,spk_1,And would be taking a cautious approach
p3,02:12:15.750,02:12:16.220,spk_0,
p3,02:12:18.850,02:12:26.380,spk_1,in respect of those [inaudible].
p3,02:12:26.750,02:12:27.170,spk_3,"Essentially, My Lords,"
p3,02:12:27.180,02:12:39.890,spk_1,"that was the reasoning which caused him to say, at the hearing in the High Court that he felt this jurisdiction should deal with the matter if the matter was going to be looked at or [inaudible] or otherwise."
p3,02:12:39.900,02:12:40.570,spk_0,And
p3,02:12:41.150,02:12:46.410,spk_1,"that is still on balance, his view. I should say though"
p3,02:12:46.420,02:12:47.760,spk_0,and I have tried to stress [inaudible]
p3,02:12:49.250,02:12:49.520,spk_3,that
p3,02:12:49.520,02:12:51.960,spk_1,is is'nt a easy balancing exercise.
p3,02:12:51.960,02:12:53.020,spk_0,He had had considerable
p3,02:12:53.020,02:12:58.770,spk_1,difficulties in this matter he hasn't been able to speak
p3,02:12:59.850,02:12:59.910,spk_0,there are obviously
p3,02:13:00.270,02:13:25.970,spk_1,"facts and considerations and difficulties, in relation to child service circumstances there, and the attitude of the [inaudible]. So it has been a difficult balancing exercise. My Lords I hope that has assisted in clarifying the guardians position."
p3,02:13:26.750,02:13:28.560,spk_0,"What I don't intend to do, My Lords,"
p3,02:13:29.050,02:13:31.900,spk_1,unless
p3,02:13:32.850,02:13:33.160,spk_3,
p3,02:13:33.160,02:13:41.180,spk_1,"I'm required to, is deal with a number of the matters that have already been raised in relation to the first stage, I've made a number of"
p3,02:13:41.180,02:13:42.300,spk_0,observations in the written case
p3,02:13:42.680,02:13:55.370,spk_1,[inaudible]. But I can add to that at this point in time. But what
p3,02:13:55.370,02:13:56.250,spk_3,I would
p3,02:13:56.430,02:15:45.450,spk_1,"seek to do is to address issues in relation to the voice of the child or indeed the guardian on his behalf, either in terms of jurisdiction and also in terms of best interests. And I would also seek to address, if I may, the assertion that has been made that Section 1(5) would essentially enable a decline of jurisdiction or the matter not to be dealt with because the court could open - could make, sorry, no order. Lords, the voice of the child in my submission is important, and it is important at an early stage. We have a situation where, as I've indicated at the outset, it is perhaps, a more likely occurrence than not, that there would be a guardian appointed on behalf of a child party in proceedings such as this. We have a situation where in terms of consent and jurisdiction as set out in Article 12, it is very clear that it should involve all the parties. And it is of some concern to the guardian if there is an interpretation that effectively does not enable those appointed on behalf of the child to have a voice on this point. I accept that at that early stage, one isn't looking at a full welfare evaluation."
p3,02:15:48.940,02:15:49.180,spk_0,But
p3,02:15:49.180,02:16:01.750,spk_1,I would say that clearly it is of relevance for anybody appointed on behalf of the child to have an input into what the child's best interests may be at that time.
p3,02:16:04.000,02:16:31.850,spk_2,"And just looking back at what you showed us in Paragraph 95 of the Rule when the court is considering whether it's in the best interests of the child to be made of party, do I follow from what you've just been saying that one of the things that should go through the courts mind is is it in the best interests of the child that he or she should be made a party before I decide whether or not I've got jurisdiction? Is that what you're saying?"
p3,02:16:32.230,02:16:43.650,spk_1,"Indeed. And it may be, following through the debate that we've heard over the last two days that, in fact, in cases of this kind,"
p3,02:16:45.330,02:16:45.500,spk_0,the
p3,02:16:45.500,02:16:56.660,spk_1,"appointment of the guardian is something that needs to be addressed by the court at the first available opportunity, so that they can then have any input into any jurisdictional decisions that may be made. Yeah."
p3,02:16:59.030,02:17:00.360,spk_0,
p3,02:17:05.630,02:17:05.960,spk_1,
p3,02:17:11.429,02:17:11.660,spk_0,
p3,02:17:12.030,02:18:33.639,spk_1,"Lords, in essence, it does seem inconsistent to have a situation where you can be appointing somebody to advocate on behalf of the child, but then have a system that is excluding them from very significant decisions which obviously can have an impact on the child. Lords in relation to the suggestion that Section 1(5) of the Children Act is a way around this, I would seek to make the following observations because, of course, Section 1(5) would come into play towards the end of the proceedings. And that would expose the child, potentially, to proceedings, long proceedings, with the associated anxieties and uncertainties. And clearly, there needs to be an earlier best interests decision. So in my submission, Section 1(5) is not necessarily a viable solution."
p3,02:18:34.519,02:19:22.830,spk_3,"But we're actually talking about two completely different things. We're talking about the preconditions for the exercise of jurisdiction at all which has a range of factors when we're talk about best interests which include practicabilities, which include where's the evidence and how can we get the evidence and so on. And then we're talking about supposing the court accepts jurisdiction, and therefore because it considers the proceedings should go ahead. And then all sorts of process happens and the court has to decide what order at this stage in relation to the child's future is in that child's best interests. And among the options, which may commend itself to the court, is making no order."
p3,02:19:22.840,02:19:23.840,spk_1,But
p3,02:19:23.840,02:19:42.139,spk_3,"nobody is suggesting that it's the only option. Nobody's suggesting that it's a solution to really jurisdiction problem. It's just being suggested that if the facts turn out that there is no point at all in the English court making an order because,"
p3,02:19:42.820,02:19:43.160,spk_1,for
p3,02:19:43.160,02:19:52.790,spk_3,"example, the wishes and feelings of the child are, I want to stay in Pakistan and I'm very happy here, and I don't want to be brought back to England to see mum. The court's answer may be no order."
p3,02:19:53.220,02:19:53.540,spk_1,
p3,02:19:54.120,02:19:55.840,spk_3,

p3,02:19:57.030,02:20:03.490,spk_3,that's an example of the difference between accepting jurisdiction and how you exercise that.
p3,02:20:03.500,02:20:26.080,spk_1,"Indeed. My Lady, it may have been my misunderstanding, but I had understood that Mr Baker was using it as a way of saying that the guardian can invite the court, at the end of the day, to make no order and therefore doesn't necessarily need to have a voice on the issue earlier on in the proceeding."
p3,02:20:26.080,02:20:27.640,spk_3,"Well, he may have been saying that."
p3,02:20:27.650,02:20:29.400,spk_1,"And My Lady, what I'm saying is that"
p3,02:20:29.400,02:20:31.210,spk_3,it isn't
p3,02:20:31.220,02:20:49.850,spk_1,a viable alternative to allowing the child or the child's representative a voice about jurisdictional issues and that voice to occur earlier on in the
p3,02:20:49.860,02:20:51.060,spk_3,proceedings. Yes.
p3,02:20:52.410,02:20:52.620,spk_0,My
p3,02:21:00.710,02:21:02.430,spk_1,"Lady, I'm -- But"
p3,02:21:02.430,02:21:51.170,spk_3,"of course, if the only way of applying, forgive me, if the only way of applying Regulation (12)(3) is by prior written agreement before the proceedings are started, there is no way in which the guardian could be involved because there would not be a guardian, the court would not have power to appoint a guardian and they by definition, the child at that stage is not a party. The child is often not a party in proceedings in other member states as well. The child's voice is a different thing, from the child being a party to the proceedings. And so one has to bear that in mind. But if the paradigm is prior written agreement, nothing could be done to solve your problem."
p3,02:21:51.310,02:22:03.400,spk_1,"Well, indeed, My Lady, perhaps that is one of the factors that would stack up again prior written agreement being sufficient. And of course that comes back to a point which I believe Miss Russell raised about --"
p3,02:22:03.400,02:22:04.790,spk_4,[Inaudible] sufficient as being required --
p3,02:22:04.800,02:22:07.710,spk_1,Or required as to how and
p3,02:22:07.720,02:22:08.490,spk_3,who
p3,02:22:08.500,02:22:15.650,spk_1,"would then evaluate the best interests at that initial hearings. Actually, courts"
p3,02:22:15.650,02:22:44.410,spk_3,do that all the time. I really do object to the notion that courts aren't able to make these sorts of evaluations. There are lots of cases in which children are not represented or lots of cases in which children are not parties. There are even cases in which there aren't welfare offices reports and there certainly used to be in the olden days and I'm sure that's the case in other places. So if we're taking a euro-wide look at this rather than an Anglo --
p3,02:22:45.000,02:22:45.670,spk_1,even
p3,02:22:45.680,02:22:52.720,spk_3,"Anglocentric look, because the way in which they represent the interests of children in Scotland is completely different from the way they do it here."
p3,02:22:53.900,02:22:54.190,spk_0,Can't
p3,02:22:54.190,02:22:55.220,spk_3,make that assumption.
p3,02:22:55.700,02:23:41.210,spk_1,"Indeed, My Lady, I wasn't suggesting that the courts couldn't undertake that evaluation. But in my submission, if we are dealing with situations where somebody is going to be appointed to represent the child's interests, it is often helpful for them to be able to have some input and to have that input at an earlier stage rather than to come in and then have perhaps a number of concerns that they would seek to raise that can then not be considered. My Lords, as I indicated, I don't intend to go over ground that's already been covered. I don't know if I can be of any further assistance on behalf of the guardian."
p3,02:23:41.800,02:23:50.940,spk_2,"Well, we have had a chance of reading your written submissions and you've covered a number of the points there which have, of course, been fully debated by other"
p3,02:23:50.940,02:23:51.420,spk_1,people.
p3,02:23:51.900,02:23:59.200,spk_2,"I think if you had any other points of disagreement or encouragement one way or the other, we'd like to hear from"
p3,02:23:59.200,02:24:00.660,spk_3,you.
p3,02:24:00.670,02:25:08.320,spk_5,"Could I just ask you one question on the hypothesis? This relates to Article 12 (3)(b) on the hypothesis that at the time the court is seized, on the face of it means first seized. I know that there are arguments the other way but suppose that's the case. In a case, the difference between little b in Paragraph 3 and little b in Paragraph 1 is there, the agreement is simply that of the spouses, whereas in little b it's all the parties. And one view might be that the draughtsman contemplated it, that one of the parties would be at least the voice of the child and maybe the child. Now, is there any way in which one could construe little b as only coming into force, if you like, or only giving rise to the relevant seizing once the child is made a party?"
p3,02:25:12.590,02:25:40.440,spk_1,"My Lord, I think not. I, for my part, would think the options are that if it is to include the child, then the seizing needs to be interpreted as having at least some degree of a continuum about it, so that it isn't simply the moment it continues, at least for a period. I know there was some discussion about that earlier, and it's difficult to know where cut off points could come. But I think there are"
p3,02:25:40.440,02:25:41.160,spk_0,difficulties. Thank you.
p3,02:25:41.840,02:25:50.610,spk_6,Do you have a position on whether the relevant proceedings started in 20003 or 2007?
p3,02:25:52.190,02:25:56.150,spk_1,"For my part, I think I would suggest 2007"
p3,02:25:56.760,02:25:56.930,spk_0,in
p3,02:25:56.930,02:26:00.010,spk_1,"the sense that while I acknowledge there are,"
p3,02:26:00.880,02:26:01.110,spk_5,or
p3,02:26:01.110,02:27:19.280,spk_1,"they are all proceedings in relation to the same child, to consider a number of applications in respect of one child that could take place over a significant period of time, all as one set of proceedings is, in my submission, something that could well be misleading. The initial orders back in 2003, of course, were a residence order, the order for the leave to remove from the jurisdiction. This is an application that the mother is making, asking the court, essentially, to survey fresh ground. And in my submission, it is, as a result, a separate set of proceedings. To use an example or to consider an example, if a relative, a grandmother, for the sake of argument, sought to make an application in respect of the same child, that would be viewed, one might consider, as a separate set of proceedings. A different party. But yet it's still a Section 8 application in respect of the same child. So, on balance, I think my view would be that I would see these proceedings as separate from the earlier proceedings, and starting in 2007."
p3,02:27:19.530,02:27:27.710,spk_5,"But presumably the answer that question wouldn't depend upon whether they were, in fact, in separate proceedings on a narrow, procedural -- English procedural basis."
p3,02:27:28.480,02:27:28.800,spk_0,Would one?
p3,02:27:29.980,02:27:32.290,spk_5,As a matter of construction of the regulation.
p3,02:27:36.480,02:27:37.290,spk_0,Possibly not.
p3,02:27:38.180,02:27:39.310,spk_5,Someone has to have some
p3,02:27:39.320,02:27:40.540,spk_1,broader test
p3,02:27:40.700,02:27:45.200,spk_5,"than simply asking the question, What number did the proceedings have and was it a different number from the other"
p3,02:27:45.200,02:27:45.710,spk_1,law?
p3,02:27:46.180,02:27:48.080,spk_5,I think
p3,02:27:48.090,02:28:12.350,spk_1,"it needs to be looked at in more detail than simply the case number. That certainly I would agree with. But I equally think that to say that all proceedings are under the same statute in respect one child, potentially throughout the duration of his minority, should therefore be seen as one set of proceedings is misleading and it's wrong and I don't agree with that."
p3,02:28:12.360,02:28:18.290,spk_6,Who would have been the parties to the the order that the father obtained in 2003?
p3,02:28:19.480,02:28:20.230,spk_1,The leave to remove
p3,02:28:20.230,02:28:20.780,spk_6,order? Yes.
p3,02:28:21.200,02:28:30.150,spk_1,"That, I'm assuming, would have been just the mother and the father. The local authority would no longer have been a party. I think there was a supervision order enforced, but --"
p3,02:28:30.150,02:28:31.560,spk_5,Do we have the order? Do we have the order? Yes.
p3,02:28:33.030,02:28:34.790,spk_2,"I think, is it in 25?"
p3,02:28:35.970,02:28:36.530,spk_3,20?
p3,02:28:36.620,02:28:38.770,spk_2,I'm suggesting it's in 25.
p3,02:28:38.780,02:28:46.720,spk_3,"It is in 25. Upon hearing counsel for the applicant, the second respondent --"

p3,02:28:57.370,02:28:58.200,spk_1,Yes.
p3,02:28:59.970,02:29:04.320,spk_3,The second respondent may have been the local authority.
p3,02:29:04.330,02:29:05.810,spk_2,I think that must be right.
p3,02:29:07.050,02:29:08.550,spk_3,I do
p3,02:29:08.550,02:29:09.450,spk_0,apologise for

p3,02:29:20.580,02:29:21.740,spk_2,So that's the local authority? Yes.
p3,02:29:22.530,02:29:31.480,spk_3,"They are the applicant. Sorry, forgive me. By that stage, the supervision order had just run out, had it? Yes."

p3,02:29:46.380,02:29:47.640,spk_3,was going to
p3,02:29:47.640,02:29:54.750,spk_0,to come to an end before Q was removed from the jurisdiction and there were
p3,02:29:54.750,02:29:55.610,spk_3,problems over
p3,02:29:55.610,02:30:01.040,spk_0,"contact and supervision of the contact prior to removal. So, they"
p3,02:30:01.050,02:30:02.440,spk_1,were still involved
p3,02:30:02.450,02:30:03.380,spk_0,to that extent.
p3,02:30:03.660,02:30:06.310,spk_5,Paragraph 4 seems to suggest some supervised --

p3,02:30:51.360,02:30:51.570,spk_1,This guardian was appointed on September 2008. Right.
p3,02:30:56.500,02:30:57.920,spk_2,Yes.
p3,02:30:58.460,02:31:03.620,spk_1,"[Inaudible]. I see. Yes. But, he was not involved as a public law guardian in these proceedings it was a different guardian."

p3,02:31:07.860,02:31:08.370,spk_1,Right.

It's common ground that the European Court did not favour a centre of interest test, but a fact based inquiry, and then the interesting words, broadly akin to the approach of the authorities in this jurisdiction. Thus the concession made by leading counsel on behalf of the appellant was to that effect. So the matter is never as it were been determined in anger.

My lords will be keenly aware by now of the references to nationality in the revised regulation, founded on nationality alone in relation to children physically present in some other jurisdiction. In these dire and exceptional circumstances, the tentacles of the court could stretch towards Pakistan to rescue a girl who was and always had been a British child and who was seeking British help. It would not been right to ignore her pleas. Each case would turn on its own circumstances only if the circumstances were sufficiently dire and exceptional would such an unusual order be made. Well, I can tell my Lords that it is indeed exceptional for the parens patriae jurisdiction to be used, but there are cases where it is still used. Could it be that the Brussels regulation with its interest in nationality is one which is capable of providing a refuge of jurisdiction for its citizens in the way that by different routes the English jurisdiction provided a now almost disused parens patriae jurisdiction. My Lords I will move on from there."

p4,00:09:14.640,00:09:23.680,spk_1,Perhaps my Lady and my Lords by the route that's being discussed before this court today.
p4,00:09:23.690,00:09:24.680,spk_3,I thought --
p4,00:09:24.680,00:09:36.200,spk_4,"But that's only submission voluntary submission to the jurisdiction, which is not likely to happen in forced marriage cases that obviously are a considerable concern to reunite."
p4,00:09:36.210,00:10:21.360,spk_1,"I indicated by a different route it wouldn't in the same way provide for the protection case because I think, my Lords that the protection provisions in the Brussels Two revised regulation which are careful and considerable relate to children physically present in the jurisdiction. And one can understand why the route is different because it's consensual that allows citizens, nationals I'm so sorry, to use the jurisdiction where in other circumstances habitual residence, which is undoubtedly the guiding principle in normal cases of the revised regulation, would say the jurisdiction might be elsewhere."
p4,00:10:21.370,00:10:22.750,spk_3,This was a wardship case.
p4,00:10:23.250,00:10:26.800,spk_1,That was a wardship or inherent jurisdiction case.
p4,00:10:27.840,00:10:33.700,spk_4,What would be the route under the regulation? Forgive me. In a case such as that.
p4,00:10:33.880,00:10:54.050,spk_1,"No, My Lady, there isn't a route under the regulation for cases without consent where the child is outside the jurisdiction. But there is a root if My Lords except the submissions of Mr Baker and Mr Devereux where there is a consent."
p4,00:10:56.740,00:11:08.680,spk_3,Are you meaning that is this dealing with the best interest point and the last sentence last phrase in Paragraph 12.4? When you've gone a long way through all the hoops by the time you reach that.
p4,00:11:09.080,00:11:09.880,spk_1,And I'm starting --
p4,00:11:09.890,00:11:11.830,spk_3,It only really resonates at that point.
p4,00:11:12.040,00:11:39.770,spk_1,"At that end but there's a certain commonality of principle arguably with making a provision which in very different circumstances takes cognisance of the child's best interests, perhaps jumping ahead on a very summary basis in terms of the acquisition of a jurisdiction under Article 12 and the approach of the English courts in the parens patriae tried jurisdiction."
p4,00:11:39.770,00:11:40.370,spk_4,That's the only point you're
p4,00:11:40.370,00:14:13.300,spk_1,"making, in effect. Indeed. The analogy falls to the ground completely when one looks at the other aspect of the gateway. The revised regulation says there's going to be agreement. So the essentially X party application, although technically on notice hearing before Mrs Justice Hogg doesn't work. My Lords, if I can pass on from that to deal with Article 12 and in the order done within our written case, the third state. My Lords overnight having heard my Lord Lord Collins perusal of the English and French texts and these are documents which have been distributed at the bar, we cast the net wider. There is an official European website called Europa. On that there are the EU's translations of the regulation in all the member state languages. We have provided my Lords the only changes being a slight removal of gaps so that each fits on one page, respectively with English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. And to save My Lords the trouble of identifying the particular parts, as a reminder in Article 12.4 third state appears twice in the English text and appears once on at 61.b. Over the page in French, état capital e Trois third state appears twice in exactly the same context in Article 12 4. But in Article 61 it's different. [speaks French]. They're looking forward to the German My Lords."
p4,00:14:13.660,00:14:14.530,spk_5,The translation.
p4,00:14:14.640,00:14:34.230,spk_1,"And in German it is straightforward. Article 12.4 [speaks German] capital d, but then it would be because it's a noun and the same the bottom of that paragraph, and equally at 61(b) [speaks German]."
p4,00:14:34.240,00:14:36.070,spk_3,
p4,00:14:36.540,00:15:57.300,spk_1,"Italian is in some ways the most interesting of all. Article 12.4 [speaks Italian] which is not a party to the Hague Convention. So not a third state, but a party which is not a state which is not a party to the Hague Convention. But then at the bottom most interestingly, as my Lady has spotted [speaks French]. And although I am not a translator for this court, that is country as in the French pays and not state. And it's a lower case p. And at 61.b again, no reference to third [speaks Italian]. And finally the Spanish Article 12.4 [speaks Spanish]. But in Article 61(b) [speaks Spanish]. I'm tempted to suggest"

p4,00:15:59.840,00:16:56.100,spk_1,"Lords that one should be cautious in what one makes of all of that because it is the same regulation with its first language we believe French but with all those as official translations on the EU website. So to read too much into the Italian use of country with a small letter as opposed to state, and to read anything in particular into the alternations in third state and non member state may be unwise. But my Lords I subject to of course to any questions that the court may have of me leave My Lords to be the judges of that. We thought that the information might be useful to have."
p4,00:16:56.110,00:16:57.170,spk_3,Thank you very much.
p4,00:16:58.840,00:17:39.170,spk_1,"So far as the rest of it is concerned, we can't I think subject to questions add very much to what My Lords have been already been told. For what it is worth the meaning and the interpretation which the appellants and seek to apply seems to be the more straightforward in terms of the drafting and the effect. But it is Your Lordships and not us, who are the judges of that."

p4,00:18:05.520,00:18:49.770,spk_1,"So My Lords, I could pass on having indicated we take a tentative position on the interpretation of the third state. If we were to look briefly at a question of effect on the question of what might term policy. We've been careful about the use of the word policy in our written case, and we've distinguished between this as a regulation"
p4,00:18:50.340,00:18:50.730,spk_2,which it
p4,00:18:50.730,00:20:30.840,spk_1,"is on conventions where one can look at the purpose of intent. And we are mindful of the fact that courts have fallen into error, courts below the level of this court, in seeking to apply policy over much in the context of international children's cases. The best known example has been where courts have erred in non convention child abduction cases by importing what's regarded as the policy of the Hague Child Abduction Convention into non convention cases, where it is domestic law and the interests of the individual child that is concerned. But my Lords are entitled we tentatively suggest to look at the regulation and to see what it is that it sets out to do. And in our submission what it sets out to do is among other things, to regulate jurisdiction and regulate it in a way which leads to certainty and an absence of conflict. And so when construing Articles 12.3 and Article 12.4 for that matter, one can look to see, perhaps with the assistance of the practise guide, what it is that the regulation intends to achieve. And we say this comes"
p4,00:20:30.840,00:20:31.840,spk_5,to the construction
p4,00:20:31.850,00:21:11.760,spk_1,"of Article 12.3 that it's desirable that within the rules, a jurisdiction is discerned with certainty which will stick. I can put it in that way. So the idea of a continuous assessment of jurisdiction or a jurisdiction without or a position where there isn't what used to be called a fixed terminus a quo to the determination, it would be very difficult to fit in with the intendant of the regulation."
p4,00:21:11.860,00:21:18.550,spk_3,And you ask us to read the phrase at the time when the court is seized with that principle in mind.
p4,00:21:18.560,00:23:56.680,spk_1,"If I may, well I let me My Lord come to that now. There are a number of possible ways that it could be read. But looking at the sub article the date of seizing is with with respect clear from the four corners of the regulation by Article 16. Looking at the instant case one approach that My Lords could have is to say, well what on the basis of all the evidence was the position of the parties at the time of seizing? There we go back leaving aside for the moment questions of variation and continuation of proceedings which are interesting to the undertaking given by the father at the time of the relocation, and he is undertaking was to return the child if called upon to do so by the court, not in these proceedings. And it could have said in these proceedings but it didn't. By the court that is the English court. The father therefore, it might be said, was inevitably and following intensive proceedings in which he had been represented, making a concession for all the world to see and one which bound him on paying a possible imprisonment to respond obediently to requests from the English court. Now My Lords the use or the continued use of undertakings in relocation cases has been the subject of much interest to practitioners and of the occasional observation by judges, including in the Court of Appeal. And it's sometimes being said that their outmoded, particularly in cases where, for example, the Hague Child Abduction Convention applies. This is not one of those cases. It might be said that in the generality of cases in which the Brussels II revised regulation applies while they are outmoded or they're a clumsy way of achieving an end if what the court really has in mind is a reservation of jurisdiction."
p4,00:23:56.690,00:24:04.860,spk_3,"So you're saying that even if the 2007 proceedings were new proceedings, there was still a continuing acceptance of jurisdiction."
p4,00:24:05.440,00:24:22.560,spk_1,"There is a continuing acceptance of the jurisdiction of an English court in a case concerning this particular child. And as it happens, both the parties who are the parties to the 2007 proceedings. So if the court wishes to look at it that way."
p4,00:24:23.600,00:24:29.370,spk_5,The moral of the story is not to give the undertaking but to let the court exact it.
p4,00:24:29.710,00:25:23.050,spk_1,"Indeed, indeed it is that perhaps if My Lords were minded to consider guidance, one might roll everything together and it would go rather like this. If one is making an order for relocation, there needs to be a positive consideration, one which is overt as to whether it is intended that a jurisdiction should be retained. If it isn't retained, then if it's a European case pursuant to Article 9, after three months, the jurisdiction will pass, and that will be the end of it and there won't be a residual interest in this country. Alternatively, looking at what is said to be the approach in cases to which the regulation doesn't apply"

p4,00:25:34.240,00:26:09.690,spk_1,"Article 12 provides the route and arguably that is the time to say to the parties, Do you want to retain an English jurisdiction? If you do, do you go through the hoops if this is a children's case only of Article 12.3 that could be recorded on the face of the order, and then there would be no room for doubt, including in the foreign court.

p4,00:26:11.140,00:27:41.310,spk_1,"Say, save by rare first instance judges, in any case. Taking it forward if one considers the effect of Article 17 of the revised regulation. Article 17, coupled together with Article 18 provides a positive onus on judges to consider jurisdiction at the earliest possible stage and realistically, there's a limit to the scope for that to be done when proceedings are launched. And that comes to the analysis of the interplay between the different aspects of Article 12.3(b) and that is to say accepted express your otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. At the time the court is seized, it may well be that there is only one active party. The other party won't necessarily have had the chance to say anything at all. And there is a difficulty at the moment with that. It's a difficulty which some practitioners address by writing on a document acknowledging"

p4,00:27:42.720,00:28:22.460,spk_1,"That the acknowledgement is made subject to a challenge to jurisdiction, then matters are absolutely apparent from that moment on. But when a case first comes before a judge with both parties represented, or if it starts without notice hearing a direction can be given that the question be asked of the other party. It may be that a positive question can be asked by the judge even perhaps in cases where it isn't obvious that there may be a problem as to --"
p4,00:28:22.460,00:28:27.900,spk_5,That may be too late. Because all that would be post seizing under Article 16.
p4,00:28:27.900,00:28:44.320,spk_1,"My Lord, I will come to an interpretation albeit an interpretation which may cause a slight variation of the approach of my Lord Lord Lord Collins in Bush, which gets around that."
p4,00:28:44.450,00:28:45.550,spk_5,I was just reading the language.
p4,00:28:45.940,00:28:52.580,spk_1,"So am I, My Lord, but perhaps in a different way. I'll come to it in a moment."
p4,00:28:52.630,00:28:59.770,spk_5,"Because we have to fit in this whole notion of seizing with all the other jurisdiction, the jurisprudence on seizing of which has been a very great deal."
p4,00:29:00.140,00:29:12.590,spk_1,"There is with great respect My Lords, no doubt that the date of seizing is that described in Article 16. It's a fixed point, and it's a very early point."
p4,00:29:12.590,00:29:15.610,spk_3,And it's a point at which the court may have only one party before it.
p4,00:29:15.610,00:29:16.090,spk_1,Precisely.
p4,00:29:16.480,00:29:25.720,spk_5,"It's a point at which, if little b is to be satisfied, there must be an unequivocal acceptance of the jurisdiction."
p4,00:29:25.880,00:29:29.500,spk_1,Not necessarily. So I'll come to that. If I may.
p4,00:29:29.510,00:29:45.780,spk_3,Can I just -- I'm trying to get firm ground at least for point one. And that is that you accept for the purposes of this argument that seized is the moment when the court is first approached and the document is represented.
p4,00:29:45.930,00:29:47.120,spk_1,It can be no other. So it --
p4,00:29:47.840,00:29:48.030,spk_3,As
p4,00:29:48.030,00:29:49.890,spk_1,interpreted by Article 16.
p4,00:29:49.890,00:29:54.350,spk_3,So you're not suggesting that one waits until the court has both parties before it.
p4,00:29:55.240,00:30:06.680,spk_1,"Not for seizing but seizing and jurisdiction, as My Lady observed or perhaps it is My Lord, Lord Kerr, are not necessarily the same thing. But can I come to"
p4,00:30:06.680,00:30:07.230,spk_3,that. Yes all right.
p4,00:30:07.250,00:30:20.380,spk_1,Actually probably I should come to it right now and then it relieves the tension in me. We are all waiting for
p4,00:30:20.380,00:30:21.440,spk_4,"your magic rabbit to come out of the hat, Mr Setright."
p4,00:30:23.720,00:31:15.860,spk_1,"I hope I haven't fallen flat. If one looks carefully at Article 12.3(b) and one reads it in this way. The jurisdiction of the court has been past tense, accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner, and I'm now going to read it with an emphasis by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seized. So, in other words, that's a description, not at the time at which there must be the express acceptance, but the time at which the constituent parties who have to give their consent are counted."
p4,00:31:16.340,00:31:20.300,spk_4,So at the time the court is seized is descriptive of parties not acceptance.
p4,00:31:20.310,00:31:24.490,spk_1,Yes. That works.
p4,00:31:24.500,00:31:25.960,spk_3,Yes.
p4,00:31:28.040,00:31:29.320,spk_1,And how
p4,00:31:29.320,00:31:30.950,spk_5,does it fit in with Article 19?
p4,00:31:31.440,00:31:52.570,spk_1,"If My Lords, it does, and if I refer also to Article 17 I think my starting point probably is Article 17."
p4,00:31:52.570,00:32:00.740,spk_5,"Article 17 is only about a case where there are two competing jurisdictions, both of which are in member"
p4,00:32:00.740,00:32:01.960,spk_2,states.
p4,00:32:02.640,00:32:16.960,spk_1,But it's a different principal My Lord where a court of a member state is seized of the case it has no jurisdiction. So there --
p4,00:32:17.040,00:32:21.080,spk_5,"And over which, of course, of another member state has jurisdiction. That's what Article 17 says."
p4,00:32:21.090,00:32:48.970,spk_1,"With great respect, My Lord maybe so, but it's still concedes within the four corners of the regulation that it is possible for a court to be seized. So seizing is a technical consideration related to that early point. It may be seized, but nonetheless not have a jurisdiction. And so the question of jurisdiction can legitimately be considered at a time following seizing."
p4,00:32:50.970,00:32:52.530,spk_5,"Practically, it must be."
p4,00:32:52.540,00:32:53.580,spk_2,
p4,00:32:54.300,00:32:59.220,spk_1,Precisely because the practicality of --
p4,00:32:59.220,00:33:07.770,spk_5,"It has to be considered subsequently, obviously. But jurisdiction surely is if there is jurisdiction is as at the moment of the seizing."
p4,00:33:10.440,00:33:11.050,spk_1,Say if --
p4,00:33:11.060,00:33:15.200,spk_5,And that's the whole way in which these conventions have been construed actually for years.
p4,00:33:15.210,00:33:22.540,spk_1,Say if My Lord that Article 17 appears to countenance something else.
p4,00:33:22.760,00:33:37.980,spk_3,"The court has to make a number of assessments as first of all the question of the acceptance. But presumably the court also has to consider the best interests of the child. And it can't do that at the date of when it is seized, because it has to have some material put before"
p4,00:33:37.980,00:33:38.270,spk_1,it.
p4,00:33:38.940,00:33:51.340,spk_3,"So, I mean, I suppose to that extent there's force in the point that the assessment of whether jurisdiction exists has to be postponed until the court can apply its mind to the"
p4,00:33:51.340,00:33:51.860,spk_5,point.
p4,00:33:52.440,00:37:24.460,spk_1,"Many years ago, this house and I'm afraid I've not put the authority before the house, considered the concept of retention in child abduction cases. It was H and S and the parties argued on the one hand, I said this house that house it was, on the one hand, the contention that retention was a continuing stage under the Hague Convention, one could pick the date that was most convenient for the parties to illustrate a point. Or in this case, a date following a contracting state entering the relevant convention. The House said no fixed terminus a quo, and one has to look at the earlier state of retention despite the word retention which carries with it a certain continuum. In this case, we suggest seizing is clear. It's got to be that early moment that the regulation doesn't give scope for any other interpretation. But an evaluation of jurisdiction will be based on material which of course will gradually grow with the progression of the proceedings. And this will be the case in every set of proceedings. It will grow first when a second party has joined in practical terms. Thus the document starting the proceedings is issued and served, and then in some proceedings, most proceedings, the party served will have the opportunity to respond. Then there will be a court appearance and then there may be submissions and there may be evidence. We suggest that there are a number of ways of looking at Article 12.3. One is to say yes, it's got to be determined at the moment of seizing with such material as may be available at the moment of seizing. So perhaps a judge who may be a judge at a very low level in a registry who receives a paper application will have to look at it and say, Well does Article 12.3 apply because there is a consent? In that case, there'd have to be a fairly radical overhaul of the way proceedings are started if people are to have the chance of accepting or not accepting. A second possibility is that which I've postulated as the rabbit pulled out of the hat. A third is to say the date is the date of seizing. One can look at material, which comes to light subsequent to that, but rather as one would in public law care proceedings. One has to look back to that particular date to see what the position was then. There's an argument that in this case, such a test would be satisfied because of the undertakings given in the relocation in proceedings."
p4,00:37:25.560,00:37:27.050,spk_4,And everything the father did.
p4,00:37:27.060,00:37:28.150,spk_1,And everything the father did.
p4,00:37:28.150,00:37:38.090,spk_4,Subsequently. This is my point about the difference between evidence of what state of affairs was at the date of seizing and acts on the date of seizing.

00:38:54.370,00:38:55.250,spk_1,It might be a German rabbit."""
p4,00:38:55.620,00:39:03.650,spk_3,"Can I, before we get completely sold on the rabbit. Can we look at 12.1(b)?"
p4,00:39:04.020,00:39:04.370,spk_2,Yes.
p4,00:39:04.380,00:39:22.700,spk_3,"Because the same phrase appears, at the time the court has seized surrounded by commas. But does your interpretation work there. You're looking to see who the spouses are. Are you looking to see who the spouses are at the time the court is seized."
p4,00:39:23.450,00:39:27.730,spk_1,They are by the holders of parental responsibility.
p4,00:39:27.730,00:39:29.980,spk_3,So there could be different spouses at different times.
p4,00:39:30.350,00:39:38.560,spk_1,"No the holders of parental responsibility. Now it could be that a grandparent an uncle, or indeed a complete stranger, has parental responsibility."
p4,00:39:38.720,00:39:40.320,spk_3,At the time the court is seized.
p4,00:39:40.370,00:39:54.200,spk_1,Precisely exactly the same. It works because what plainly it is seeking to do is to define who the parties are at that particular time.
p4,00:39:54.330,00:40:02.740,spk_3,"The concentration is not so much on spouses, which it's on the holders of parental responsibility, you say, and you need to know what point of time they hold it or who they are."
p4,00:40:03.310,00:40:03.800,spk_1,
p4,00:40:03.800,00:40:03.910,spk_3,
p4,00:40:04.770,00:40:08.270,spk_1,If it just said spouses.
p4,00:40:08.280,00:40:08.810,spk_3,Yes.
p4,00:40:09.500,00:40:56.380,spk_1,"Then I might be a bit worried. But the addition of holders of parental responsibility they may be different, and there may be and one doesn't want to run too much down this interesting road to speculation. But for example, it could be the case that there was an unenfranchised father at the time that the proceedings were started, who later became enfranchised and a party. Now if I take that analogy with My Lords to the analogy of the child as a party in the present case. And this is where we lead on to if one takes the view that Article 12 is designed to do is"
p4,00:40:57.680,00:40:58.310,spk_2,to
p4,00:40:58.310,00:42:51.030,spk_1,"look at what the Germans call the [speaks German] the moment in time and to evaluate the parties at that moment in time. That's for the purpose of deciding on jurisdiction. It relates to seizing. It means you can join or indeed subtract parties thereafter, as often as that it would be intolerable if every time that happened, you might lose or, for that matter, gain a jurisdiction. It would avoid the aim of certainty and definition which is at the core of this regulation. So My Lords that's a possible route that we placed before Our Lord's court for that interpretation which rather leaves if I'm not rushing along too fast the best interests of the child. When should that be looked at and to what extent should it be looked at. My Lords one of the things that the revised regulation does is to put a premium on the voice of the child. And indeed, in other decisions of this house in the child abduction field, it's been emphasis that the requirement that a child be heard in child abduction proceedings has caused a change in English practise in those"
p4,00:42:51.030,00:42:51.940,spk_2,proceedings
p4,00:42:52.220,00:43:13.940,spk_1,and in the speech of My Lady it was made clear that this extended to all such proceedings not just those under the regulation. And it has. And so what follows is that if a regulation jurisdiction a regulation primary
p4,00:43:13.940,00:43:14.820,spk_2,jurisdiction is
p4,00:43:14.820,00:43:18.010,spk_1,accepted by an EU member state
p4,00:43:18.730,00:43:19.630,spk_2,as in Article 12.3.
p4,00:43:19.630,00:43:20.920,spk_3,
p4,00:43:22.000,00:45:14.040,spk_1,"It goes without saying that a high premium will be placed on establishing what the best interests of the child are in the subsequent domestic proceedings held under that jurisdiction. And so, of course, it will always be in this country. So after the jurisdiction has been accepted, there will be ample opportunity in the proceedings for dare I say it, absolutely anything to be done which the child's best interests required. The principal English statute on children's matters, the Children Act 1989, is an exceedingly flexible statute, and apart from the dividing line between the public law and private law fields it is hard to think of an order which cannot be made under the Children Act 1989 under the guise of under the umbrella of Section 8 or otherwise, which would be required to meet a child's best interests. Is there a power to review jurisdiction? Because it's my learned friend's submission that in order properly to give weight to the views of the child and the interests of the child, it's not acceptable that there should be a snapshot taken at a time when the child is not represented. And then the child comes along and the child has nothing that he or she can say about jurisdiction. One looks My Lords at Article 15."
p4,00:45:14.150,00:45:31.630,spk_3,I was just going to raise Article 15 because there is the flexibility between member states. What does one do assuming you're right about third state one's got a child from outside. What flexibility is there once jurisdiction has been accepted?
p4,00:45:31.730,00:46:28.540,spk_1,"Perhaps My Lord, I'm going to add two and two and make five but if the regulation says that there should be that ability if there's an agreement and in the child's best interests to transfer a jurisdiction in whole or in part to another member state. What is there to prevent an English court as an EU court seized doing the same to a non member state as a best interests decision. Now it's hard to find examples where that has been done. But the first analogy I take and we put it belatedly into the bundle of authorities has items 77. It's a decision of the"

p4,00:46:39.080,00:46:54.560,spk_1,in which the Lords reviewed the existence and the exercise of the jurisdiction in non Hague abduction cases. My Lords came to
p4,00:46:54.560,00:46:55.210,spk_2,the
p4,00:46:55.980,00:47:08.170,spk_1,conclusion that it was a welfare based jurisdiction and one that had to be exercised within the safeguards and without
p4,00:47:08.180,00:47:09.080,spk_2,regard to the
p4,00:47:09.090,00:48:15.990,spk_1,"policy of a Convention which didn't apply. But nevertheless, the court had this distinctive power to say following a summary hearing and on the basis of best interests that the court would direct that a child be returned to a non Convention state. On the basis that the welfare investigations, if there were well for investigations, would not be undertaken in detail in this jurisdiction. Now the basis of every Hague Convention child abduction return is a return for litigation. I am sure that I will be corrected if I am wrong. But the basis of every non Convention return is that it is either a return for litigation or it's a return on the basis that litigation if required can safely take place in the other jurisdiction. Rejection comes as in part"

And so there is an exercise of a children's jurisdiction where the English court says, No not here. You don't litigate welfare here in terms of best interests, although in the context of an abduction we litigated it in another non Convention state. The provision of Brussels II under Articles 10 and 11, which My Lords have massively not had to consider, relate to the operation of the Hague Convention. With Pakistan one is not talking about a Hague Convention state"

p4,00:49:06.770,00:50:13.820,spk_1,"But if there is a capacity of the English court on a best interests basis to transfer a child and a jurisdiction to another country, why shouldn't it in the discretion of the judge be exercised in a way, I must be careful, that might by coincidence be analogous to that provided in Article 15. There's nothing in the English jurisdiction to prevent it. That is a refinement of my learned friend Mr Baker's no order approach, but only a refinement in a small way because arguably when an English court returns a child in a non Convention abduction case, it is saying we are not making orders in this jurisdiction. Save orders which facilitate a return for litigation to the other jurisdiction."
p4,00:50:13.830,00:50:16.740,spk_0,In other words it's a decision not to continue to exercise jurisdiction.
p4,00:50:16.740,00:50:40.990,spk_1,"It is. There is a jurisdiction potential in every single non Convention abduction case because there is a presence of the child, a physical presence which passes a gateway in the Family Law Act. And there's almost certainly a need for protection also, if there's an abduction which passes one of the gateways in the revised regulations."
p4,00:50:41.000,00:50:41.640,spk_0,But the court
p4,00:50:41.640,00:50:42.920,spk_5,recognises that it has a
p4,00:50:42.920,00:50:45.990,spk_0,"jurisdiction, but it consciously decides not to"
p4,00:50:45.990,00:50:48.980,spk_1,"exercise it. Precisely so My Lord, on a welfare basis."
p4,00:50:49.860,00:51:00.230,spk_4,"It consciously decides to do something, which means it no longer retains control over the child's future. It's not so much that it's not exercising, it is exercising it in a particular way."
p4,00:51:00.240,00:51:38.620,spk_1,"It's a deliberate giving up of jurisdiction and indeed of the physical presence of the child. And it may be that that is the right way, rather than the more approximate and policy based way that it's been treated in some observations in the Court of Appeal. That's the right way to look at a relocation application and its query and to take decisions about whether a jurisdiction is to be retained and used thereafter."
p4,00:51:38.620,00:51:39.540,spk_5,It's about revisiting the
p4,00:51:39.540,00:51:45.740,spk_0,question. Do I have jurisdiction? You do have jurisdiction provided you decide that you're not going to
p4,00:51:45.740,00:51:48.030,spk_1,make orders. Yes.
p4,00:51:48.030,00:51:50.570,spk_0,"That decision, as My Lady points, is within jurisdiction."

p4,00:51:55.210,00:52:12.260,spk_1,Lord Hope's question of what can be done and looking at Article 15. Article 15 I have to concede I think as it's framed applies to transfers to EU states. But
p4,00:52:13.750,00:52:14.070,spk_5,there
p4,00:52:14.070,00:52:28.490,spk_1,"is nothing to stop judges exercising the power that I've indicated, and that again I respectfully suggest, would work."
p4,00:52:28.490,00:53:00.090,spk_3,"There is a fallback position in Article 15 isn't it if the other member state is not seized then the court which has been wanting to transfer retains jurisdiction and one would take the same view. I suppose in the case you're envisaging that if the third state court using the third state in the broader sense would for some reason another was a breakdown in communication or a party just didn't take up the offer, then the court in this country would remain seized and with jurisdiction. You better be"
p4,00:53:00.090,00:53:17.170,spk_5,"very careful there because if you said you were declining jurisdiction or anything that sounded like it, that would be directly contrary to the principles in Owusu. You'd have to say, we're exercising the jurisdiction by whether you could whether you give up future jurisdiction. I recognise that it's not a declining of jurisdiction."
p4,00:53:17.650,00:53:18.510,spk_1,It needs to be made
p4,00:53:18.610,00:53:19.980,spk_0,absolutely clear you're
p4,00:53:20.400,00:53:20.890,spk_1,taking
p4,00:53:20.890,00:53:24.300,spk_0,"a decision within jurisdiction, not to continue to deal with"
p4,00:53:24.300,00:53:46.130,spk_5,"the case. That's what they should have done in Owusu but I don't know whether the Europeans would have caught that. That's really the question. Whether in an Owusu type case, you could have got the desired results by saying, Oh well no, we're not declining the jurisdiction policy. What we're doing, we're exercising the jurisdiction but staying. The line is very, very narrow. And I respectfully doubt whether the European court would wear that."
p4,00:53:46.140,00:53:54.150,spk_3,"I respectfully agree with that because Owusu was a stay case. Yes, the court treated as if it were declining jurisdiction."
p4,00:53:54.150,00:54:28.810,spk_5,"Whereas we would've said traditionally it was a stay case and the whole point about a stay case it assumes the jurisdiction, and what you're doing is staying in the exercise of it That's precisely what the English court would have said was being done in Owusu if it was a stay case and but yet the European Courts said, No, no, no, that's declining jurisdiction. And if the substance of the thing is to decline jurisdiction, then the worry is that the European Court will say that's not permitted. I'm not saying there aren't some mechanisms and by some clever sleight of hand it might not be possible. But it's not easy."
p4,00:54:28.810,00:55:07.860,spk_1,"If I might suggest My Lord, the way that it could be done, which would be within the grammar of and syntax of the regulation. If there was a rejection in real terms, a rejection of the extent jurisdiction on new information being received particularly about this interests, then the decision might well be this that in the circumstances some particular factual arrangement needs to be made for this child. It might be, for example, that it is --"
p4,00:55:08.190,00:55:21.210,spk_5,"If there was some change of circumstances, it would be easier to establish. The problem would arise if there were really no change in circumstances and it was really the same old points all over again, but decided at a later date."
p4,00:55:21.360,00:56:51.150,spk_1,"It is very hard to think My Lord, although no doubt it's not beyond those who are in this court, of a children's case in which, following taking up of jurisdiction on this application of Article 12.3 if that view prevails, someone comes along on behalf of the child and makes a submission that the jurisdiction is not in the child's best interest on other than a factual basis, which needs to be translated into some practical arrangement. Even if it is only that, for example, the child could not be transported should not be transported to this country. It's not in the child's best interests. Or that there is some particular reason why it is not in the child's best interests to engage in an English process or some particular work needs to be done in the other jurisdiction. The English court could then say so and say in that event, we're not going to make orders. And in accordance with the principal of Article 12, subsequent litigation should take place in the country of habitual residence. The exception no longer applies. That's one way of doing it, which might very well be ECJ compliant because it would follow so closely on the reasoning of the regulation itself."
p4,00:56:52.330,00:56:53.650,spk_0,Of Article 15.
p4,00:56:55.130,00:57:12.790,spk_1,"And Article 12 arguably, because if our interpretation of Article 12 is right, it provides a gateway to jurisdiction. But there are other doorways out which Article 15 is one."
p4,00:57:12.790,00:57:26.310,spk_3,"It's a great deal of learning in relation to the Brussels Convention, in Brussels I, whether you can apply to non-member states by analogy the provisions of the regulation. It's a difficult one."
p4,00:57:26.310,00:58:09.260,spk_1,"I said that I cautioned myself when I said using Article 15 as an analogy, it might be no more than a coincidence in consideration of welfare, which was exactly the approach in a non Convention case where one doesn't follow by analogy. Indeed, one is strongly cautioned against doing so in the concurrent international Convention. But in many cases, welfare drives the court down the same route. I'm conscious of the fact that I've taken up my hour."
p4,00:58:09.260,00:58:10.060,spk_3,
p4,00:58:10.220,00:58:16.900,spk_1,May I just see if there's anything else I can very
p4,00:58:16.900,00:58:18.340,spk_3,quickly take
p4,00:58:18.820,01:00:02.860,spk_1,"Your Lordships to? I think yes, I should say this, that if My Lords except the approach that we have just outlined the investigation into welfare need only be very summary and related to jurisdiction. And at the outset, and My Lords will appreciate that consideration of welfare runs through as a paramount principle virtually every aspect of every children's case in this country as a matter of domestic statute law and before that as a matter in the inherent jurisdiction. But exactly as My Lady said, whilst the judges who deal with family cases at first instance are utterly familiar with that concept and will judge almost every aspect of everything they do on the basis of best interests as well as human rights. The weight that is giving them the coloration that's given to that aspect will vary. And so if one is looking at a decision on jurisdiction it will be a very different approach to, for example, whether there should be a relocation, whether there should be a switch of primary carer, whether a child should have medical treatment because one looks at the potential effect on the child. I don't want to go too far down that road, but it is consistent we say with a relatively broad brush approach."
p4,01:00:02.870,01:00:07.240,spk_3,Are you saying the presumption in 12.4 won't have very much weight?
p4,01:00:08.710,01:00:22.960,spk_1,In this sense that it is not of great significance in the context of what the decision is.
p4,01:00:23.230,01:00:32.110,spk_4,"But it is of significance if what one is dealing with a situation where you haven't got reciprocal obligations. That's the point, isn't it?"
p4,01:00:32.110,01:00:32.500,spk_1,That's if --
p4,01:00:32.970,01:00:42.140,spk_4,Among member states the reciprocal obligations and the 1996 Hague Convention introduces reciprocal obligations.

p4,01:00:43.270,01:00:57.600,spk_4,"of them are member states and some of them are non member states. But if you haven't got reciprocal obligations and you have a submission to jurisdiction here, well then you do start from the point of view it's not a bad idea to go on and accept that submission, don't you."
p4,01:00:57.600,01:01:41.960,spk_1,"I believe My Lady one does. It's a rebuttable position, and one they look at it country by country, perhaps in case by case. And there that's a parting word unless My Lords want more. The Pakistan Protocol, the approach that we've placed before the court, it's actually complementary to the Pakistan Protocol. Pakistan Protocol is a beneficial, informal arrangement. We don't subscribe to the criticisms that are made of it is only an informal judicial arrangement for so called normal cases. It's not a binding convention at all."
p4,01:01:41.970,01:01:44.890,spk_3,Was it designed very largely to deal with child abduction?
p4,01:01:44.900,01:02:01.350,spk_1,"Yes, it was. It was designed and I should confess that I was part of the panel present almost at its birth. As indeed I think was My Lady."
p4,01:02:01.360,01:02:06.140,spk_4,"I was certainly physically present. Yes, I have vivid recollections."
p4,01:02:06.450,01:02:08.150,spk_1,present. As was I.
p4,01:02:08.150,01:02:08.690,spk_3,Was this a visit to Pakistan?
p4,01:02:08.690,01:02:20.580,spk_1,"No it took place in the Royal Courts of Justice. And in the end, the then president of the division and the then Chief Justice reached an agreement."
p4,01:02:21.010,01:02:23.520,spk_3,"I'm interested in, no doubt it carries -- There wasn't a visit to Pakistan?"
p4,01:02:24.360,01:02:34.790,spk_1,That was following. Oh I see that was following to celebrate the protocol. I wouldn't put it that way. The protocol was born in the Royal Courts of Justice.
p4,01:02:34.800,01:02:45.890,spk_3,"It had to become a UK Protocol, as I understand it, Lady Smith and somebody from the line too so there was actually a three jurisdiction present."
p4,01:02:45.890,01:04:21.080,spk_1,"Absolutely. They were present. But it's an informal judicial protocol. The way this arrangement would be complementary would be this. That if it were to be the case that an English court decided by coincidental analogy to Article 15 to transfer part of the jurisdiction. The Pakistan Protocol with its judicial links would provide an ideal way for this to be considered and so far from driving what Convention terms as we call a coach and four through the Pakistani Protocol. This interpretation would be consistent with the spirit of cooperation, which is at that protocol's heart. But to talk about the policy of the Pakistan Protocol and to suggest that that should impede a particular result in the case of a particular individual child, the risk of criticising an eminent judge in the Court of Appeal may be going too far. It may not be an appropriate consideration, but as it happens, we say that the objectives of the Pakistan protocol are probably assisted and certainly can be exploited in this interpretation. I've taken a great deal time."
p4,01:04:21.080,01:04:22.340,spk_3,We're extremely grateful.
p4,01:04:22.340,01:04:23.220,spk_1,Is there anything else?
p4,01:04:23.790,01:04:29.140,spk_3,"I don't think so. But, Mr Gupta, I think you suggested had one or two points to add but I don't think you've got very long."
p4,01:04:33.150,01:06:17.700,spk_2,"Not very long no. If I invite the court and Lordships to look at tab 71 in the file sorry I just have to handle these papers. I had a ring binder yesterday. You'll likely come across a stapled document about three pages from the end of that staple tab 71. My Lordships and My Lady will see their at page 12 or 13 a definition of third state. It's a glossary of terms as part of the CORDIS Community Research and Development Information Service of the European Commission. A glossary of their terms and of course it states then I'll read it out for those that don't have it in front of them. Third state means a state that is neither a member states nor associated states. Examples of third states are European newly independent states and Mediterranean partnerships countries with cooperation agreements, international organisations and other non EU countries on a self financing basis if their participation is a substantial added value to the objectives of the programme, the programme is dealing with unsurprisingly international development and an answer to if one turns one page on. You'll see there, what CORIDS does, the reason why I and my learned thought that it was worthwhile documents, including the bundle, was the provenance of it."

p4,01:06:18.680,01:07:02.710,spk_2,"Really the provenance and the fact that it gives a little handy definition of third state, of course. Over the page, the next tab at tab 72 on the second page. And this, I hope, answers My Lady's question. What relevance does have? Well, some is really the answer because we have a disclaimer at the top of the second page. However, the commission accepts no responsibility or liability whatsoever with regards to the material on this website. This material is information of general nature only, which is not intended to address the specific circumstances of individual entities."

It's coming from the European Commission and I hope to assist Lord Kerr's question yesterday about other disciplines other areas of work, has the phrase third state being used. We're moving on to tab 72 there are a couple of cases which are referred to in summary and tab 73 there is one page in tab 73 that summarises everything that's in tab 72. And those are two ECJ cases dealing with member states' obligations towards third states one looks at the bottom of page 70. Sorry, tab 73. Yeah, it's got the phrase third state there and if one goes back to tab 72 you have there the two judgments that are referred to as well as the opinion I think of the advocate general."

p4,01:14:11.840,01:14:34.490,spk_0,Yeah and it's an interesting example of how the process works. Whether it considers the authority considers the argument made my Mr Setright on Article 12 presented on this day. Dealing with the specific course I don't think we need to say any more about third state.
p4,01:14:34.500,01:14:49.000,spk_3,I don't think we need any more help on that. But we obviously have some help on the more important issue that's emerged about an uncritical acceptance and timing.

p4,01:15:02.940,01:15:25.110,spk_0,phrase at the time the court is seized simply defines parties and not other conceptions. And that has the advantage a huge advantage of getting around the conundrum how do you prove acceptance or express agreement. I think very a specific moment before the parties may know all the parties may know they are instigating proceedings.
p4,01:15:25.120,01:15:29.920,spk_3,Are we on our own on this? There's no jurisprudence from other places to help us on that.
p4,01:15:29.920,01:15:32.170,spk_0,None of us here have heard any cases or put before the court on this on Article 12.
p4,01:15:34.940,01:15:40.740,spk_3,And you would read Article 12 passage in 12.1(b) I think it is in the same way would you?
p4,01:15:40.740,01:15:54.360,spk_0,Yes there are commas after 12.1(b) so there are commas after word parental responsibility [inaudible]

Interestingly of course, in this jurisdiction applications for orders under Section Eight of Children Act these parties the applicant and the respondent are parties of parental responsibility all parties have responsibilities are involved in the proceedings.

p4,01:18:18.420,01:18:24.210,spk_5,Because that's a different construction than being advanced. This is the construction we were advancing before.
p4,01:18:24.220,01:18:30.680,spk_4,This puts the phrasing commas before rather than after the holders of parental responsibility.

p4,01:18:41.320,01:18:55.930,spk_0,"On the question of unequivocal conduct, the same point would apply to Article 12.3 situation two. So my submission on unequivocal acceptance is, it can be demonstrated the paradigm example is manifestly"

p4,01:19:08.030,01:19:14.510,spk_0,would have to make the agreement before the question of jurisdiction was considered. It doesn't have to
p4,01:19:14.520,01:19:21.240,spk_3,be agreement it has to be acceptance. So the undertaking could form that acceptance.
p4,01:19:21.250,01:19:24.480,spk_0,Lord Clarke asked me about agreement.
p4,01:19:24.480,01:19:26.170,spk_5,Or undertaking which ever it was.
p4,01:19:26.250,01:19:46.130,spk_0,"Well, at the point the court had the point the court considers jurisdiction it has to consider, is there unequivocal acceptance? In the absence of express agreement, which clears that up it look at all the circumstances of the case and in particular looks for conduct indicating acceptance."
p4,01:19:46.390,01:19:58.470,spk_3,"And you could have cross undertakings or else you don't have agreement as such, both parties, in their separate ways for their separate interests have given undertakings to the same court. You could draw conclusions."
p4,01:19:58.470,01:20:10.160,spk_0,"You could. Of course, we're dealing with an imperfect situation where that the court has we are looking at this court is looking at at the situation several years on from the moment when the matter of jurisdiction could've happened."
p4,01:20:10.310,01:20:19.730,spk_3,"I still don't understand why you talk about the undertaking, for example, being conduct. The undertaking itself is acceptance."
p4,01:20:20.810,01:20:40.060,spk_0,Well I don't see to call on the Lord on that point. It is. It is acceptance at that point. One could interpret it maybe this is the interpretation my Lordship favours that is indicating acceptance and unless or until it is withdrawn that acceptance continues.
p4,01:20:40.100,01:20:44.040,spk_3,It can't be withdrawn except by order of the court.
p4,01:20:46.210,01:21:08.750,spk_0,"Well, My Lord, maybe I'm not putting the point with sufficient force before you. If that's Your Lordship's view then I won't of seek to dissuade you. But in fact, what's happened since then. Everything has happened since then has underlined that the father continues to accept the jurisdiction, he turns up for the first hearing before the deputies regarding exceeds to an order all the way through the position of statements."

The consequence of the interpretation Mr Setright puts forward is that the voice of the child would not be heard on jurisdictional issues say if circumstances where the child was already a party. In my submission that is an inevitable consequence of the interpretation which he puts forward, and indeed the interpretation that we put forward."
p4,01:21:40.610,01:21:41.120,spk_1,But
p4,01:21:41.120,01:22:32.120,spk_0,"it is our submission that assessing best interests is a matter which the court has to conduct which my Lady points out whether or not the child is a party. The court might conceivably decided to join the child as a party to the proceedings and ask for guardian to prepare a report on the question of best interest before determining jurisdiction. That's unlikely. The court might, probably in certain circumstances, would ask CAFCASS to carry out a short investigation just to advise it as to what the best interests were on this point. But ultimately, it's a matter for the court to determine whether or not the child is a party as the court is frequently having to do in family cases generally."

p4,01:22:54.340,01:23:23.110,spk_5,"I'd just like to ask the question I just asked a moment ago. That is to say is there any notion that it's got to be this acceptance or agreement let's call it an agreement for the moment, it could be an acceptance I recognise. Is there any limit in the Article as to when you could make that agreement? I mean, can you make it after there's been I suppose it's held that there is no sufficient agreement for the purposes of Article 15 or sufficiently. And then can one say, Well okay, we'll make one."
p4,01:23:24.600,01:23:26.800,spk_0,"My suggested interpretation of this would be,"
p4,01:23:27.820,01:23:28.230,spk_1,it
p4,01:23:28.230,01:23:32.510,spk_0,is possible at any point up to the moment jurisdiction is to be considered by the court.
p4,01:23:32.520,01:23:37.890,spk_5,"Why didn't even then why not afterwards? If we didn't make a good enough agreement the first time, why not say it wasn't a very good one we'll make another."
p4,01:23:37.890,01:23:48.370,spk_0,The court makes it sufficient acceptance of the court has jurisdiction. The court is considering jurisdiction at that point after the parties agree.
p4,01:23:49.360,01:24:08.020,spk_5,"They can say, well, suppose the court says I'm the judge, I'm simply not satisfied that there was any sufficiently clear and unequivocal acceptance. Could the parties then, as long as it were the parties at the time the court was first seized of course, they could at any time could they even if there was a new party?"

p4,01:24:13.370,01:24:15.070,spk_5,It's just a matter of construction of the article.
p4,01:24:15.400,01:24:22.800,spk_0,"Yes, the party on Mr Setright's interpretation the parties are fixed at the moment the time the court is seized."
p4,01:24:22.820,01:24:36.020,spk_5,"If you don't make a good enough agreement  the first time there's no reason why you shouldn't make one later, since there's nothing about time on this analysis in the Article. But suppose by this time the child is a party. Would it never they nevertheless be a good agreement?"
p4,01:24:36.990,01:24:47.060,spk_0,"There would. But at that point, if the child was a party and the guardian was instructed, the court would consider the guardian's position on the best interest."
p4,01:24:47.060,01:24:47.300,spk_1,
p4,01:24:48.390,01:24:54.090,spk_5,"So your answer to my question is it could be made at any time in this arrangement it could, but it's a matter of construction of the Article."
p4,01:24:54.920,01:25:37.450,spk_0,"Yes, as a matter of construction My Lords but it's not going to rise in practise after the question of jurisdiction is presented by the court. Well, if the court has to ask itself, Have I got jurisdiction. If the court did do that in this case until very late in the day. But if it asks at the outset, do I have jurisdiction? Then one of the questions the judge has to consider is do the parties agree or have they unequivocally accepted? If they haven't unequivocally accepted, that them to the election. Do you agree? If they say no, then he doesn't have jurisdiction under Article 12 3. If they say yes, then he does, and that's the end of it."
p4,01:25:37.450,01:25:43.640,spk_5,"If they came back a week later and said, Okay we decided to agree now would that be alright."
p4,01:25:43.650,01:25:53.540,spk_0,"A week later I dare say a week later, a judge might a judgment use a pragmatic excuse. The judge might say yes."
p4,01:25:53.540,01:25:56.020,spk_5,Maybe unlikely. I don't know anything. All sorts things can happen.
p4,01:25:56.490,01:26:31.800,spk_0,"Well, let us if they say no, that's the end of the case. If they come back a year later and said, We've changed our minds, then we conduct the exercises over again doesn't he? Because he's got a fresh application by this stage, an express agreement. He then has to consider himself asked himself at that point. Is it in the best interests of the child to exercise jurisdiction? And he might. But he won't have jurisdiction until if there's not, it is clearly not an agreement. Still not agreement, but he might subsequently get jurisdiction if fresh proceedings are started when the parties agree."
p4,01:26:32.980,01:26:58.320,spk_3,"And you're suggesting are you that in doubt in case of doubt, he should put the parties to their election? Is that something the regulation really contemplates? It seems it's a strange idea really. I mean, I can see if a common law freedom of choice approach to things that might be sensible to do that. I'm not sure that's where the rules work."
p4,01:26:58.410,01:27:45.740,spk_0,"It has never been regulated never been considered by until this case in this detail. And I dare say what happens here after will depend very much on what this court says. It's bound to. I imagine that judges hereafter, who are considering cases where this is likely to arise and maybe in a great number of cases, will devise a formula for asking the question to satisfy that such questions are required to be answered to satisfy themselves they have jurisdiction. Indeed one can see that the prudent course would be for regulation for rules to be drafted, which ensure that the question of agreement jurisdiction is identified and answered at the outset of the proceedings. Indeed, on the acknowledgment of service form or by some other process."
p4,01:27:47.280,01:27:57.990,spk_4,"But you would presumably say that once agreement or acceptance has been manifested, it can't be withdrawn."
p4,01:27:59.580,01:28:16.730,spk_0,"It can't be withdrawn. That's right, once sufficient once there is a clear agreement or sufficient demonstration of acceptance to indicate there is there it exists, then the other tests to satisfy. Then the court has jurisdiction, and on it goes to consider the case."
p4,01:28:16.740,01:28:34.670,spk_3,There is a flavour of that in Article 9.2 which is looking at continuing jurisdiction. And one thing that's clear from 9.2 is that once you've participated in proceedings without contesting jurisdiction. You can't it's too late to start changing your mind thing is simply well.
p4,01:28:34.670,01:28:37.950,spk_0,That would certainly be the practical solution.
p4,01:28:38.070,01:28:40.810,spk_3,That would be the sensible approach to 12 as well.

p4,01:28:43.990,01:28:44.850,spk_2,they are not going to want to be
p4,01:28:45.700,01:28:58.770,spk_0,burdened with the prospect of ongoing issues as to jurisdiction. They want to use the phrase from another case a swift and unsentimental approach on jurisdiction and get on with it.
p4,01:28:58.780,01:29:13.280,spk_3,"It's fine within the member states because then you've got Article 15 to fall back on as we can see. And from the experience you've had, it seems to work reasonably well. One can understand all of that. It's really the third state problem. That is the difficulty."
p4,01:29:14.170,01:29:26.490,spk_0,"Well, I propose that Mr Setright's observations about the possibility transfer with third states, although of course, as we've seen earlier under the Hague Convention"

There are many countries where there are no such agreements, anyplace. I was just going to make one of two observations about other matters which have arisen very briefly. First of all, My Lady is being concerned about the proceedings"

But in this case, they are clearly in circumstances where there is fresh evidence that has emerged. Then it is the court that has a discretion to to conduct a rehearing. The complaint in this case was the procedure that the mother was not given proper notice of the judge's intention to review the findings and furthermore her cross examination of the father on those allegations was unfairly curtailed. And that was the subject of an appeal. First of all to Mrs Justice Hogg in 2004 and then, some years later, an attempt to appeal the decision of Mrs Justice Hogg, who refused the appeal in 2004, an attempt was made to appeal Mrs Justice Hogg's decision in 2007 to the Court of Appeal."

Because I understand it, it didn't appear on that occasion as I understand it the Court of Appeal took the view that it could not be justified in the circumstances of that case, reopening an issue. There was no reason to reopen an issue at that stage at such a length after length of time. But the concern, as I said, was not the court had the power, but the way in which was executed in that"

p4,01:32:42.850,01:33:14.160,spk_0,My Lady has the court has raised the question of undertakings to return. This featured substantially in the submissions made by my learned junior Mr Devereux before Judge Barnett on the basis of the case that was then being advanced. And it might be interesting just to look briefly at his judgment which is
p4,01:33:14.160,01:33:14.580,spk_2,in
p4,01:33:15.150,01:33:27.580,spk_0,"appendix part 1, tab 4. It's as a report from the family law reports."

p4,01:33:29.550,01:33:45.520,spk_0,And Mr Devereux makes paragraph 35.
p4,01:33:45.520,01:33:49.930,spk_2,
p4,01:33:50.110,01:33:58.160,spk_0,Mr Devereux said that to invoke [inaudible] or to the undertaking upon the court order [inaudible] for the father to

p4,01:34:00.790,01:34:30.600,spk_0,child Q when ordered to do so by the court. Mr Devereux made it that the undertaking is of critical importance provided or potentially provided the legal foundation for the order Judge Hedley made on the 17th June 2008 and required in the jurisdiction. In this context Mr Devereux invited me not to follow the approach and reasoning of Mr. Justice Thorpe as he then was. I will consider the relevant section of below 36.
p4,01:34:31.640,01:34:31.820,spk_1,
p4,01:34:31.820,01:35:08.270,spk_0,"Paragraph 36 he quotes Justice Thorpe saying as follows the first undertaking the convention taken to return the child to this jurisdiction, if ordered so to do, has for many years automatically been extracted from any successful applicant for leave to take a child permanently from the jurisdiction. It had undoubtedly a useful function in the days when the movement of children across international boundaries was not regulated by international convention and statute as it is today. But in the age that succeeds the Hague Convention, the Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985 and the Family Law Act 1986 I cannot see that the conventional undertaking has a surviving use or function."
p4,01:35:08.640,01:35:08.870,spk_1,
p4,01:35:09.840,01:35:51.050,spk_0,"Mr Devereux submitted such reason was only persuasive. Strictly speaking that may be so, but the analysis is that of a judge's expertise and experience in child abduction cases is only too well known. Mr Devereux also says that the present case is clearly distinguishable because the relocation was of course to Pakistan an non convention country. That is not the standard of Pakistan critically, I acknowledge the difficulties in securing the return of a child from Pakistan to this country. However, these points do not in my judgement destroy the fundamental basis of the reasoning behind the passage quoted above, which I'm happy to accept. However, let it be assumed that I'm wrong and I don't think in this case is an important it can and should it be enforced, is it self conferred jurisdiction? In my judgement, it does not."
p4,01:35:51.810,01:35:51.940,spk_1,And
p4,01:35:51.940,01:36:11.560,spk_0,then he goes on in the judgment. Well my Lord this case I suggest has proved the ongoing value undertakings because if Your Lordships and My Lady accept our submissions the undertaking given by the father

He's simply saying, Why bother to extract it if there are other ways of regulating the situation? But the question with which we're concerned really is what is the continuing force of such an undertaking in a case which is not governed by any binding international law obligations."
p4,01:37:37.280,01:37:43.610,spk_3,In any event the threat of imprisonment might be rather more effective than proceedings in a foreign country and the Hague Convention.

p4,01:37:44.930,01:38:03.530,spk_4,"Well it is how we used to enforce equity used to enforce everything, making injunctions or extracting undertakings and enforcing them against the person.

p4,01:38:11.630,01:38:31.270,spk_0,"for our part, we submit that in this case, this case demonstrates the importance of ongoing importance of undertakings in cases in particular where children are being removed to countries who are neither the parties to the European regulations or to the Hague Convention."
p4,01:38:31.280,01:38:35.530,spk_3,Or particularly where the parent is or may be coming back here.
p4,01:38:36.120,01:38:41.920,spk_0,Yes. There are particularly important in those circumstances for enforcement reasons.
