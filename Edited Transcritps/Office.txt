p1,00:00:46.540,00:01:09.640,spk_1,"My Lords' I appear today, Mr Chowdhury, for the appellant, the information commissioner and Miss Rose, together with Ms Collier and Mr Potter appear for the respondent Ofcom. And My Lords' will know that this case raises a short but important point concerning the proper interpretation of Regulation 12(1) of the environmental information regulation."
p1,00:01:09.650,00:01:11.830,spk_2,Is this a case for a reference?
p1,00:01:13.640,00:02:19.610,spk_1,"It may ultimately be a case for reference if the following two hurdles are not crossed. If your Lordships' are content that our construction of the domestic regulations is correct as a matter of domestic law, then no reference need arise because Recital 20 of the directive and General Principles of Community Law would allow us to go if you like further than the directive. Were your Lordships' to be against us on the question of the construction of the domestic regulations as a matter purely of domestic law, then your Lordships' would have to look at the directive because we say the directive not only permits but requires the interpretation that we adopt. And in that situation, if your Lordships' and your Ladyship was satisfied that it was clear that the directive means what we say it means. Then again, there would be no requirement for a reference. But if your Lordships' were against this on domestic law and were not satisfied that the director was clear in the way that we would say clear, then your Lordships' would be under duty under Section 234234 sub Article 3 of the Treaty of Rome to make a reference."
p1,00:02:19.620,00:02:33.920,spk_2,Is there not a middle position where we would find it quite difficult to decide which side is right? I mean that's a situation where it's really not out clear. We can't be absolutely certain one way or another. If
p1,00:02:33.930,00:03:09.150,spk_1,"your Lordship reaches the view that the case turns on the interpretation, that directive, and if your Lordship reaches a view that is not act clear in either direction, then Your Lordship would have to refer. If, however, you are satisfied that as a matter of purely domestic construction, the regulations mean what we say they mean, then your Lordships' need not make a reference because the directive contemplates that we could if we wish to go further as a matter of domestic law and that set out in Recital 20 which is in Tab five. I don't know if you look at the director. Okay,"
p1,00:03:10.040,00:03:11.830,spk_2,you can
p1,00:03:11.830,00:03:23.870,spk_1,"on this analysis on this hypothesis, we would be making it easier for individuals get access or more difficult for the public access. And if you want to go to a bigger part of 24"
p1,00:03:23.990,00:03:25.860,spk_2,20 doesn't seem to be on the point at all.
p1,00:03:26.960,00:03:28.500,spk_1,"24. My Lord, it's my mistake."
p1,00:03:29.340,00:03:29.480,spk_2,The
p1,00:03:29.480,00:03:35.680,spk_1,provisions of this directive shall not affect the member state to maintain or introduce measures providing for broader.
p1,00:03:36.390,00:03:41.850,spk_0,That's consistent with the word May in Article 4. Member states may provide means they
p1,00:03:42.420,00:03:42.860,spk_1,have to
p1,00:03:43.470,00:03:44.080,spk_0,the
p1,00:03:44.080,00:04:17.450,spk_1,"recital set out policy, and that was My Lord Lord Month with respect that it's a permissive thing. So we could in fact, do what is permitted by Article 4 and also we could have even more limited restrictions if we wished so. As a matter, you also need to decide this as a matter of domestic law first, and if we are right on domestic law, then that is the end of the matter. If, however, your Lordships' are concerned that we are wrong with the matter of domestic law, Then your Lordships' do need to consider Is the direct impact player in the way that we say it is?"
p1,00:04:20.140,00:04:20.350,spk_0,Okay
p1,00:04:22.540,00:04:23.010,spk_4,here.
p1,00:04:23.170,00:04:24.660,spk_0,Could the court of Appeal have referred?
p1,00:04:25.640,00:04:29.690,spk_1,They had a discretion. After 34 to their discretion. Your lawyers have a duty
p1,00:04:30.070,00:04:30.520,spk_2,to consider.
p1,00:04:31.020,00:04:51.360,spk_1,"They did consider a number of things, including Regulation 12(4). But I'm not criticising the Court of Appeals court and there's a lot of things to do. But they didn't consider reference, and they didn't. They don't certainly recording the judgement. I wasn't obviously present in the court of appeal, and they don't seem to look at the relationship. Regulation 12(4) and Regulation 12(5)."
p1,00:04:52.040,00:04:52.240,spk_3,"Yeah,"
p1,00:04:52.840,00:04:56.260,spk_1,"but they have a discretion. Your lawyers have a duty, will be well aware."
p1,00:04:57.340,00:04:57.550,spk_2,Okay.
p1,00:04:57.940,00:04:58.150,spk_4,
p1,00:04:58.940,00:06:14.320,spk_1,"subject to any further questions about the reference I shall summarise the appellant submissions on the question of construction and then turn in more detail to the regulations and to the directive. In brief as your Lord of the leadership known, the regulations oblige public authorities to make environmental information available on request. Regulation 12 provides for a limited exception to that duty, namely, a public authority may refuse to disclose environmental information if an exception in Regulation 12(4) or (5) applies, and if the public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosure. In the submission of the Appeal. Oh, if an exception is relied upon as justifying nondisclosure, the proper approach is to consider. First, is that exception applicable? And second, if so, does the public interest in maintaining the exception outweigh the public interest in disclosure? Can"
p1,00:06:14.330,00:06:34.070,spk_0,"I'm sorry to interrupt. Can I just go back to your starting point? You're asking us to construe the English regulations in the abstract? Are you without any European background? I question that. Surely, in order to the likelihood"
p1,00:06:34.070,00:06:34.610,spk_2,is
p1,00:06:35.340,00:07:19.170,spk_0,"that the Parliament didn't intend to draw the fine distinction or any fine distinction between the way it implemented the directive and the directive. In other words, the likelihood is that it didn't actually intend to restrict to exercise the freedom under Recital 24 or it would have made it a lot clearer. One suspects likely it is, they just transposed it into what appeared to be the appropriate domestic language, and therefore, actually, we have to form a view as to the meaning of the directive in order to work out what the regulation's mean. And you're rather subtle point that we can consider the regulation's and forget about the European position fades away."
p1,00:07:19.450,00:07:46.710,spk_1,"No, My Lord, for this reason, if to take My Lord Lord hopes analysis and it is unclear what the director is meant on this particular issue. And if it was not clear, then the interpretation that the draughtsman, the English or British or Welsh and Northern Irish draughtsman gave to those or Scottish draughtsman gave to those regulation's have to be considered, as you put it in the abstract, you'd have the"
p1,00:07:46.720,00:08:00.080,spk_0,"same a willy nilly have failed to do what he probably intended to do, namely to reflect the precise meaning of the directive. He may actually intended to go narrow without realising it, because he misread the directive that again seems to me rather order"
p1,00:08:00.090,00:08:19.900,spk_1,"with respect. If the director were not clear, say this court, would you consider that directly wasn't clear and that would have been the same position for the draughtsman, and the Draughtsman then would have had to decide what to do in a situation where it wasn't clear what Article 4(2) of the directive meant, the drafting would have to say, Well, I have to implement them. I have a discretion. What set of regulation's shall I"
p1,00:08:19.900,00:08:54.360,spk_2,"make in what sense has drafted a discretion? This these regulation's were made under Section 22 of the European Communities Act 1972 and not under any other legislation. And the power, which is given in Recital 24 is really just stating the obvious. That in itself is not a provisions of community law to which effect could be given by the 72 act."
p1,00:08:54.370,00:09:48.220,spk_1,"The answer to that, My Lord, is the Section 2 to when we need to have Section 2(2) in front of one. But it gives broad powers to implement community obligations or to make regulation's in connection with all related to. I have to go back to check the word. So there is a slightly broader domestic law interpretation to the scope of Section 2. To otherwise, one would hurt always the problems domestic law. If you didn't make it absolutely match for the director, there would be an issue that Section 2(2) does not provide for that. There is a provision to make supported legislation. I forget the precise words I'd have to look at Section 2(2), but it's in connection with or related to. And there are a series of cases which I can certainly course attention should they wish dealing with the scope of that. There's a case called Oakley and a case called X Party Unison, which confirms that the regulation making powers under Section 2(2) are not limited simply to implement in the community obligation but are also broad enough to do ancillary or related matters"
p1,00:09:48.230,00:09:50.460,spk_2,"yes, but not to make substantive law."
p1,00:09:50.840,00:10:10.190,spk_1,"It can do that. Yes, there are cases that say they can do that where it's connected with where. For example, community law covers 90% of the territory and you need 10% more than you use Section 22. You don't have to find a different power to use for the other 9 10% so it can make as Your Lordship puts its substantive law."
p1,00:10:10.440,00:10:57.400,spk_2,"I think you may have misunderstood my early intervention. I was contemplating a situation where we found it evenly balanced. Looking at the regulation -- right -- I was taking the ground that you're taking, in effect starting off the regulation and finding myself into in doubt as to what the draughtsman was really getting at, particularly when we look at Regulation 12 and the way the balancing exercises addressed there. And is it not right that one would then go back to the directive for some kind of guidance as the context in which the the regulation has been framed? And that leads one into the question as to what the directive. Yes -- so it's a process of moving backwards from the regulation. Yes -- if we find it difficult to construe the regulation in the way you're arguing,"
p1,00:10:57.420,00:11:33.050,spk_1,"Yes, I certainly accept that that is and must be correct in my condition. That must be correct. If you find that the regulation's don't answer the position, you have no choice but to consider the directive because as a minimum, the regulation's are meant to satisfy the requirements of the directive -- yes --  so that is correct. The situation that I'm dealing with, a slightly different situation where the directive was said to be uncertain one way or the other, and if the directive was said to be uncertain, one or the other or not a clear one way or the other. Then it may be that the regulation's were capable interpretation, even without the assistance of the director. Can you"
p1,00:11:33.050,00:11:37.350,spk_2,consider that without looking at the [inaudible]  behind the directive?
p1,00:11:37.740,00:11:38.250,spk_3,Yes.
p1,00:11:40.300,00:11:41.510,spk_2,It's a very bold answer.
p1,00:11:42.290,00:11:51.950,spk_1,"Well, the question was, Can I consider it? And the answer is, Yes I can consider it. Indeed, we're about [laughing], Should we is another question? Yes, you can. What you mean"
p1,00:11:51.950,00:11:54.090,spk_3,is everybody up till now has so why
p1,00:11:54.100,00:11:55.240,spk_0,shouldn't
p1,00:11:55.240,00:11:55.540,spk_3,we?
p1,00:11:56.140,00:12:35.740,spk_1,"Everybody in this case and everybody in most cases, including the European courts and a number of instances when you look at the travel prepared for even in Luxembourg is very limited indeed. And the last time I thought to persuade the [inaudible] of the court because in September to look at the [inaudible], they said it meant the exact opposite of what we've said anyway. So the [inaudible] prepared for does not assist, but I think the starting point is the start of the regulation's. See whether not the regulation's are clear. You cannot divorce these regulation's from the directive in any event, because they are there to give effect to the directive and the policy of the directive is to maximise access to environmental. That"
p1,00:12:35.740,00:13:04.700,spk_0,"was precisely my point, really. The idea that the parliamentary draughtsman achieved clarity in a particular sense because he perceived that the directive left his options open and he was uncertain as to, or he was uncertain as to what it meant. It seems to me, slightly remote. I rather suspect that the way this happened was that he just intended, as I said before, to give effect whatever was the prima facie official position under the directive."
p1,00:13:04.780,00:13:20.180,spk_1,"That gives me what I need to do My lord is persuade you that I'm right in the domestic regulation's first. If I'm wrong on that, but it's clear that the directive means what I say it means. If I am wrong and it's not clear and it's more evenly balanced in, Your Lordships' will be under a duty to make a reference to Article 234, you would have no option then."
p1,00:13:20.640,00:13:21.110,spk_3,But that would
p1,00:13:21.120,00:13:27.360,spk_1,be the third stage when I've done my summary submission and looked at the regulation's and the provisions of the directive.
p1,00:13:27.370,00:13:29.750,spk_2,So you want to start off with Regulation 12(1).
p1,00:13:29.840,00:13:31.980,spk_1,I want to start off with Regulation 5 if I may.
p1,00:13:35.340,00:13:35.970,spk_2,Regulation five.
p1,00:13:35.970,00:14:16.190,spk_1,"In summary the wording of the regulation's, the structure, the regulation's and the policy underlying the regulation's, in my submission does support our view that what you do is consider in relation to each exception to rely upon where the public authority identifies an exception that it wishes to rely upon. Is that exception applicable? And if so, does the public interest in maintaining the exception outweigh the public interest in disclosure? Where the authority wishes to rely on more than one exception, you have to go through each exception. In turn, is the exception applicable? And does it outweigh the interest in disclosure? The disclosure being the"
p1,00:14:16.190,00:14:17.600,spk_3,"same in each case, I take"
p1,00:14:17.600,00:14:18.770,spk_1,it the
p1,00:14:18.780,00:14:21.580,spk_3,"interest in disclosure being the same in each case,"
p1,00:14:21.580,00:14:23.110,spk_1,the interesting disclosure being the same. The
p1,00:14:23.110,00:14:38.380,spk_3,"exception is different, but the way the interest in disclosure against each exception -- yes exactly -- and are we here, has all this money being spent on this case, because the respondents believe that they are less likely to have to cough up this"
p1,00:14:38.380,00:14:39.990,spk_2,information if
p1,00:14:39.990,00:14:41.650,spk_3,their case is right.
p1,00:14:41.660,00:15:25.550,spk_1,"That's logically follow. We say that can't actually following the facts of this case. For this reason, the public authority relies on two separate exceptions public safety and intellectual property rights each exceptions applicable. Neither exception has been judged to justify non disclosure. The tribunal and the information commissioner looked at public safety. It said yes, information tribunals engaged with marginal doesn't justify non disclosure did the same with intellectual property rights. It applies, but it doesn't justify nondisclosure. And in our submission where you have to separate exceptions,"
p1,00:15:26.640,00:15:27.630,spk_2,each
p1,00:15:27.630,00:15:34.050,spk_1,"of which is applicable but neither which justifies non disclosure, then you cannot reach a different"
p1,00:15:34.050,00:15:34.760,spk_3,result
p1,00:15:35.340,00:16:01.330,spk_1,"by aggregating the two interests, neither of which justifies disclosure and then say the two interests together in some way justify disclosure. Nor are you assisted by referring to some overall public interests, as if that had a different content from the exceptions, It is the public interest in maintaining the exception that has to outweigh the public interest in disclosure. What"
p1,00:16:01.330,00:16:03.400,spk_4,is the public interest in disclosure?
p1,00:16:03.840,00:16:17.970,spk_1,"Well, the public interest in disclosure is a number of things at its highest level it is really what is set out in recitals to the directive, which is transparency in environmental decision making. The public have access."
p1,00:16:17.970,00:16:23.160,spk_2,I thought Article 1 told you what you needed to know -- exactly -- what it is. Paragraph 1 of the preamble --
p1,00:16:23.240,00:16:24.000,spk_1,Of the preamble yes --
p1,00:16:24.410,00:16:29.280,spk_2,"to that, as I read it was sitting out the public interest."
p1,00:16:29.290,00:17:10.290,spk_1,"Exactly. Yes, and it may. The factors may differ, it may be very acute for example, in one case, if you're dealing with an immediate planning application as to whether something that's a bit more revoked. But the public interest in disclosure, as My Lord Hope and My Lady Hale says, is really the same, and it's in the first recital. It's increased public access to environmental information and the dissemination of such information contribute to a greater awareness of environmental matters, a free exchange of views, more effective participation by the public in environmental decision making and eventually to a better environment. And I summarised that in our printed case at Paragraph 34 --"
p1,00:17:10.939,00:17:12.740,spk_4,"[Inaudible] in these regulation's anywhere,"
p1,00:17:13.130,00:17:16.730,spk_1,"No, the regulation's reflect that -- I thought we"
p1,00:17:16.730,00:17:18.750,spk_4,were looking exclusively at the regulations.
p1,00:17:19.939,00:17:32.090,spk_1,"I'm trying to look at the regulation's, have been tracking the directive. I will shortly at some stage this morning look at the regulation's and then I will look at the directive. For the moment, I've been sidetracked into --"
p1,00:17:33.200,00:17:47.410,spk_2,"It's not sidetracked at all it's a very important thing to understand what the phrase means. The position is, I think, this Lord Saville's hinting that there isn't anything in the regulation's that actually identifies or defines public interest. He's got to take it from somewhere."
p1,00:17:47.460,00:18:15.640,spk_1,"Yes and that's why it must be from the directive. That's why you can never look at the two entirely in separation or in isolation. I accept that. And if you look at the regulation's themselves, tab one, all we know is that the from the preamble there is that the direct the regulation's were made pursuant to Section 2(2), and we know from Regulation 2 that it means, as you see at the top of the next page, the directive and is dealing with information."

p1,00:18:24.540,00:18:53.230,spk_4,"that seems to identify what one might describe as two public interests. Reliable and openly available information about the location and operating characteristics of those sections, which would help to reduce mistrust and might be value in epidemic, Definitely logical, I find difficulty pronouncing that word. So could it obviously that there are two public interests in this particular case? What"
p1,00:18:53.230,00:18:58.150,spk_1,"we would say, My Lord, there are two factors or two facets -- can"
p1,00:18:58.150,00:18:59.170,spk_4,you aggregate them?

p1,00:19:28.440,00:19:29.580,spk_1,You could say that
p1,00:19:29.590,00:19:30.270,spk_4,not be so.

Identify the matters that are relevant to the bouncing exercise under 12. And when you're dealing with the public interest in disclosure, you may well want to consider, and you would have to consider the individual matters relevant to the public interest in disclosure because that may be relevant to the exercise. If you're dealing with an imminent planning application, you may need to have the particular information in order to deal with that. If you're dealing with an historic planning application, you may still be entitled to the information --"
p1,00:20:04.730,00:20:28.490,spk_4,"I'm not saying I disagree with it it just seems to me, that when you're looking at one side of the scales you're looking to see, you have to start do you not by looking at the public interest in disclosing the information you have to start there otherwise you can't do. You have to look at that because otherwise you can't do the balancing."
p1,00:20:28.500,00:20:54.030,spk_1,"The starting point is that an individual's inhabitants of the regulation's, without having to take any interest whatsoever to have access to the environmental information, that is the starting point. If the authority wishes to refuse to comply with the duty, the second stage is that the authority must identify the exception that seeks to rely upon. Then there is a need to identify is the exception applicable, and then there is the need to -- you're quite"
p1,00:20:54.030,00:21:49.810,spk_4,"right. I was starting at the Regulation 12 point. But the Regulation 12 point, is the case where an exception has been relied upon, which falls within Paragraphs 4 or 5, yes. Then you've got to do a balancing exercise. Yes. You got to look at the public interest in disclosing information -- yes --  and you've got to look at the public interest in maintaining the exception. Yes -- now my question was concerned with the public interest in disclosing the information. Yes -- if there is no public interest in disclosing information and there is public interest in maintaining the exception, obviously the exception applies. So at some stage, you've got to identify the public interest in disclosing information."
p1,00:21:50.150,00:21:58.630,spk_1,"With respect, My Lord, in our submission, that is not how the regulation's of the directive operates. It is a given that there is a public interest. It's a given?"
p1,00:21:58.880,00:22:00.370,spk_4,Where do we find that?

But having said that -- okay -- whilst reading these regulation's against the background of the directive and directive the Convention and knowing how far Regulation 5, for example, that a public authority has to make it available on request. Knowing the background knowing Recital one to the directive. There is a public interest, which is a given in disclosure. That is the starting point. Under Regulation 14, you will have to set out the matters that you've taken into account, and the public interest in disclosure may have different facets or matters. You also have Regulation 12(2) My Lord, I don't If you look at Regulation 12 to a public authority shall apply a presumption in favour of disclosure. That's in the regulation's itself."

p1,00:24:08.290,00:24:14.170,spk_4,can't find anything in the regulation's that says anything about public interest.

Speaking to myself, I don't quite see how that could have any meaning in view of Regulation 12(b), saving the case that the balance is entirely equal between disclosure and non disclosure, whereupon you apply the presumption and you solve that particular conundrum by saying, Well it's equally balanced with the presumptions and disclosure. So disclosure"
p1,00:25:07.770,00:25:58.850,spk_1,"To respond to your Lordship's question is easy to go back to first principles. There is no doubt these regulation's first, that these regulation's are intended to implement the directive. And there is no doubt that policy and allowing the directive and therefore the policy underlying the regulation's, operates on the basis that an individual is entitled to access without having to state an interest. That's the first point, and to that extent, I accept that you cannot divorce the regulation's from the directive. The second point is, do the regulation's themselves contained within them the seeds of a policy that favours disclosure, and in my submission it does because if you look at the entirety of the regulation, starting with part two, they are concerned with access to information, obligations to disseminate information and to make it more readily accessible. Obligations in  Regulation 5 to make it available on request. Regulation 5 does that because it is seen as a good that it is available on request without having to state an"

You also have the presumption of disclosure, and you have Regulation 14, which says that you look at the matters or you identify the matters referred to. In my submission taken alone, but certainly in the context of the directive, the regulation's favour environmental access on request. The question that I was dealing with is a separate question, on the question of interpretation of Regulation 12(1). Is it possible to decide this case without a reference? And the answer is yes, if this court is satisfied, the regulation's mean what the appellant says it means if, however, you are uncertain about whether or not the regulation's, as a matter of pure domestic construction, may be a better way of phrasing it. If you are unsatisfied that you can reach that conclusion as a matter of pure domestic construction and that you have to look at the directive, the second question for this court is, is the directive act clear one way or the other?"
p1,00:27:12.540,00:27:12.830,spk_3,If
p1,00:27:12.830,00:27:23.170,spk_1,"it is act clear in our direction, then that will supply the deficiency about the domestic regulation's. If it is not act clear, then your Lordships' have no choice but to refer."
p1,00:27:23.840,00:27:41.400,spk_2,"And what ones looking for in the regulation's am my right, is is the process which the regulation's identify that has to be gone through in in reacting to the request. And I'm looking particularly Regulation 14(3)(b)."

So it may be, and I think you've accepted this one gets a broad view of what the public interest considerations are in the preamble to the directive who wanted anything else. But when you come to the particular case,"
p1,00:28:17.740,00:28:18.370,spk_3,the
p1,00:28:18.370,00:28:30.890,spk_2,authority is expected to identify what particular case particular features it identified here. And maybe you go to the Stewart report and find what relevant in this particular instance would that be the line of thinking that were invited to
p1,00:28:30.890,00:29:56.450,spk_1,"take? You could do that. In fact, in this case, as you will have seen from the judgments down below, the reason for the request was sent by Health Scotland, whatever the title is for the National Health Service in Scotland. And he said, I want this information. He didn't actually state why he wanted it, because the whole point is that the request is in the jargon, request blind or interest blind. You assume that the person is entitled to if you don't have the situation where he has to justify his or her access to it, and it was assumed that it was reputation, geological research from the nature of the information in the nature of he was requesting. But if Your Lordship wants to look at page 187, 89 and 90, you will see how the body concerned off home actually dealt with it. 187 is the letter following the final review. This is in the core volume 187 and you'll see at the bottom paragraph following careful consideration. I regret to inform you that Ofcom will not disclose the national data set as you have requested. This information is being withheld as it falls under the exceptions in Regulation 12 (5)(a) and (c) of the Environmental Information Regulation's 2004, in applying exemptions of comments, had to balance the public interest in withholding the information against the public interest in disclosure. That of course isn't the test because it's maintaining the exception. But if you wanted to go to 189, you'll see the annex"
p1,00:29:56.450,00:29:58.010,spk_3,"there, and it set"
p1,00:29:58.010,00:30:45.820,spk_1,"out the first exemption that they were relying on Regulation 12(5)(a). And it set out the factors for disclosure, which is the fact that My Lord Saville is referring to and the factors for withholding. And then they gave the reason why the public interest favoured withholding the information and that exception. And then, if your Lordships' turn over the page, you'll see the Regulation 12(5)(c) Public safety Again. The factors for disclosure, which is effectively summarising the steward report versus the factors for withholding. And then they set out why they thought that intellectual property rights justified non refusing, and what the information tribunal did was consider each application each exception. They accepted the 12(5)(c) applied. But they said it doesn't outweigh the public interest in disclosure"
p1,00:30:45.830,00:31:08.970,spk_2,"that are you saying that when one looks at the letter to the top of page 188 and the [inaudible] what Ofcom has done is identify in accordance with Regulation 14(b). I think it is a matter, the matters which they consider in the field of public interest are relevant to the particular exceptions, and they have set the area for debate pages. 189 and 90"
p1,00:31:09.690,00:31:28.960,spk_1,"appears to be the matters under b and the factors for and against, and if Your Lordship looks at the opening words of 14(3), the refusal to specify the reasons, and that appears to be the bottom part of the bottom part of 189 and 190. And they've given the reason to reach exception. Yes."
p1,00:31:29.540,00:31:33.380,spk_2,So they're performing a task in the way that you suggest they should have done.
p1,00:31:33.390,00:31:49.250,spk_1,"The annexes certainly performed a task in the way that we suggest they should, asked whether the exception is applicable. If so, weigh the public interest in maintaining the exception against the public interest in disclosure and they've done that and then they've come to a decision on"
p1,00:31:49.250,00:31:50.520,spk_4,it. The
p1,00:31:50.530,00:31:52.150,spk_1,"information tribunal did the same,"
p1,00:31:52.160,00:31:52.730,spk_3,came to
p1,00:31:52.730,00:32:02.900,spk_1,the opposite conclusion and concluded that the public interest in maintaining the exception in 12(5)(a) did not outweigh the exception. And then
p1,00:32:02.910,00:32:03.260,spk_3,
p1,00:32:03.940,00:32:56.350,spk_1,"Ofcom and indeed, the information tribunal did the same for 12(5)(c), and the tribunal found that the exception applied because it might give some assistance to criminals. But it didn't have any strong adverse effect because the information is largely in the public domain in any event, and they decided that the public interest in, maintaining the exception. Oh, sorry, that's safety. Public interest in intellectual property rights didn't outweigh the interest in disclosure of information. So you have a decision on each exception, they're applicable. But neither of them justifies non disclosure. And we say the process of aggregation cannot lead to a different result. If neither exception justifies non disclosure, putting them both in the same sentence or thinking about them both at the same time can't alter the fact that neither exception justifies non disclosure."
p1,00:32:56.360,00:32:58.260,spk_2,So these proceedings are entirely academic.
p1,00:33:01.040,00:33:01.330,spk_3,They
p1,00:33:01.330,00:33:18.760,spk_1,"should be. But what the Court of Appeals said, if Your Lordships' go to Paragraph 42 you can see the error in the Court of Appeal just by looking at Paragraph 42 of the Court of Appeals judgement. I think it's 42 yes, 42 at page 18 of the core bundle."
p1,00:33:20.540,00:33:20.770,spk_4,"Yeah,"
p1,00:33:21.340,00:34:24.760,spk_1,"the court that I do not accept. The tribunal, concerned that the accurate approach makes the application of the exception is unworkable or that it's capable of producing a nonsensical outcome. I see no greater difficulty in principle in looking at the aggregate public interest in maintaining the political exceptions than in looking at the public interest in maintaining a particular exception. In each case abroad, judgement is required just pausing there that's not correct. When you go back to the directive, they talk about specific and defined circumstances. But moving on it says, Of course, it may be convenient in a particular case to proceed in the first place. Exception, by Exception, will you have to do that at the very least, to see if the exception relied upon is applicable? Considering whether each exception applies and if it does, whether the public interest in maintaining it outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information. There is no objection to that course, of course not because that is what you do. Does the exception apply? If so, does it outweigh the public interest in disclosure? But then the course is there's no objection to that, of course, provided that the matter is also looked at in the round"
p1,00:34:25.340,00:34:26.100,spk_3,at the end of
p1,00:34:26.100,00:34:50.550,spk_1,"the process. By considering whether the aggregate public interest in maintaining the effects of exceptions outweighs the public interest in disclosure, there is no aggregate public interest that is different in content from the applicable exceptions. The two exceptions looked at individually. Do not each of them justify non disclosure,"
p1,00:34:51.440,00:34:51.710,spk_3,putting
p1,00:34:51.710,00:35:27.490,spk_1,"them in the same sentence, combining them transferring them aggregating them, cannot alter that simple fact. So where this court has gone wrong in my respectful submission is having accepted that you consider each exception to see it's applicable and have been considered whether or not the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosure, they then say, and then you stand back and you look at something called the aggregate public interest or my friend calls it the overall public interest. But there is no such aggregate public interest or overall public interest. The interest is in maintaining the exceptions."
p1,00:35:27.500,00:36:19.890,spk_2,"Is that approach not attaching too much importance to the grounds, which are set out at pages 189 and 190? The argument can't be closed off by the public interest by looking at the factors Sadaf Khan said they took into account is not room for a broader view going back to the preamble, the broad interest in in disclosure and so on, which underlines the whole of the exercise. I'm not sure I follow the logic of your argument. I can quite see you can carry out the exercise that is invited by the presentation on these two pages that there's a residue surely isn't that deciding whether, given the overall purpose of these regulation's and the background, whether the result is the one that ought to be reached?"
p1,00:36:19.900,00:36:21.740,spk_1,"No, My Lord, for this reason."

p1,00:36:23.250,00:36:49.250,spk_1,"starting point is disclosure. Nondisclosure must be justified. It can only be justified in limited and specific circumstances. That is the exceptions in 12(4) and (5). That is the sum total of the material, which would justify non disclosure if the factors relied upon do not justify disclosure, when considered individually, there can be no separate interest, which is different in form and content from those two exceptions."
p1,00:36:50.230,00:36:50.430,spk_3,
p1,00:36:50.430,00:36:59.950,spk_1,"There is no stepping back and looking at it in the round. There is only the consideration of the applicability of the exceptions, and whether the substance of the exception applies"
p1,00:37:02.030,00:37:03.170,spk_4,in
p1,00:37:03.170,00:37:25.590,spk_2,"this case is it would be very odd if you could aggregate these two potential exceptions whether they are chalk and cheese, or apples and pears. It might be possible to construct an example which would engage all of the exceptions, and then it would be rather rather odd to have to consider each of them one by one without the thing in the round"
p1,00:37:25.950,00:38:33.820,spk_1,"two responses to that. Firstly, there may be situations where the factors underlying one exception are also factors that would be relevant to another exception. If you're talking about, I want information about the location of the basis of our allies in the United Kingdom, the facts that you want to have, information that may affect defence because people know where they are and they can go and attack them. Those same facts may apply to international relations because the Americans, or whatever allies we've got at the moment, may say to us, Don't you dare give our information but our bases so it's the same facts, but they feed through to a different interest. But my second submission, My Lord, is this. And I think your Lordships' do need to look at the structure of the regulation's very carefully because there is no way, in my submission that the Jasmine intended to aggregate the type of exceptions under Regulation 12(4) with the type of regulation's exception 12(5). They are very different regulations, and if I could just take a look to the structure of the regulation's as well as the wording that may be will assist us, if I could ask you to go to Regulation 12."
p1,00:38:36.120,00:38:36.330,spk_4,We
p1,00:38:36.330,00:39:01.750,spk_1,"say Regulation 12 is quite simply said, there is a duty and you're relieved of it in certain circumstances, and the exception applies, and the interest in maintaining the exception outweighs. And you can have lots of exceptions, and you might have six reasons. But all that does is define the circumstances in which the duty does not apply. But if your Lordship look at 12(1)(a). An exception to disclosure applies and Paragraph's 4 or 5"
p1,00:39:02.440,00:39:02.550,spk_0,and
p1,00:39:02.550,00:40:27.710,spk_1,"then 12(b), public interest in maintaining the exception and the suggestion of the respondent is that you have to aggregate all the exceptions, but you that construction must apply to the exceptions. In four and five, you cannot say you must aggregate the ones under five or you must aggregate the ones under four. It must be contemplating either what we say you look at each individually or what the respondent says, which is that you look at them in aggregate. But if Your Lordships' turn the page and look at the kind of exceptions in four and five, you'll see that the nature of the exceptions and the tests that are applicable are very different. 12(4) is really dealing with some deficiency or flaw in the request or some matter relating to the nature of the information. 12(5) is dealing with the adverse effect or impact that disclosure would have on a specified external interests. If your Lordship looks at 12(4) for example, you'll see that the test is the public authority may refuse to disclose information. To the extent that and five are set up, b the request is manifestly unreasonable. C the request for information is formulated in too general a manner, and the public authorities complied with Regulation 9. D is the materials in the course of completion and E is internal communications. So those are matters that are related in effect at the request of the material."
p1,00:40:27.720,00:40:44.610,spk_0,"I find it a frightfully powerful argument. I can see the force of what you're actually saying, but why are four and five necessarily to be accumulated? If individual exceptions within four or five hours to be accumulated"
p1,00:40:44.980,00:40:47.330,spk_1,"powerful, My Lord could develop it"
p1,00:40:47.510,00:41:09.450,spk_0,"Well, of course, but I mean, your case is basically that there is a fundamental difference, as they're obviously is in the director of the regulation between what for is dealing with and what five is dealing with. Yes, but once you accept that, then you accept that there's a difference. You have to treat four and five separately, but it doesn't follow that you have to treat the individual components of four or five separately."
p1,00:41:09.460,00:41:49.190,spk_1,"But if the exceptions are different in nature and tired, the suggestion that it is difficult in practice as I'll show you when I developed the submission to aggregate the kinds of exceptions in four with the kind of exceptions in five that is a strong pointer that the draughtsman did intend each to be considered individually rather than cumulatively, and you weren't meant to decide was for example 12(4)(c) applicable, was 12(5) applicable, and then to aggregate the public interest in maintaining the exceptions for general requests and public safety together. If I could just develop the submission a little, My Lord, you understand the way"

p1,00:42:22.200,00:42:29.610,spk_1,in turn and our first read of the line. Then you ask if that exception outweighs the public interest in disclosure.
p1,00:42:30.100,00:42:30.370,spk_4,It's
p1,00:42:30.370,00:42:36.720,spk_1,"more than one exception is relied upon. You do that sequentially, and if you look at four and five,"

p1,00:42:37.350,00:42:55.610,spk_1,"submission that I'm trying desperately to make is that it is inherently unlikely, given the nature of the exceptions relied upon the different tests that the Draughtsman did contemplate an aggregation of something in four and five, and it is therefore, inherently more likely that our submission is correct."
p1,00:42:55.800,00:43:00.640,spk_0,I don't think you're trying to make it. I think it's about the third time you've made this in the case.

You need to give assistance. It's in too general a manner. So you decide whether firstly it applies whether it's too General and the authorities complying with Regulation 9, we say you then go on to weigh the exception against the interest in disclosure. If you look at 5(a), the question would be a public thought, he may refuse to disclose information to the extent that its disclosure would adversely effect, and here we're dealing with public safety to take an example. Now there are two ways in which can realistically be done. Either you do what we say that you consider the first exception, is it to general? Have they complied with Regulation 9?

p1,00:44:28.690,00:45:05.380,spk_1,"And then the question is how do you then aggregate or balance 4(c), which is looking at the generality of the request and five a. The adverse effect on public safety. We say you do each in turn and balance each exception against the interesting disclosure. And if that is done, then we say there's no way in which you can reach a different result by then going back and looking at it in the round. The alternative way of doing it is to say, Well, I just decide applicability first, c applies to general complied with the request for assistance."

p1,00:45:06.430,00:46:00.300,spk_1,"relied upon that are applicable? Yes, public safety. You would then have to give some kind of value to the interest in not complying with general requests and some kind of value to the interests in maintaining public safety. And you then have to combine those in some aggregate fashion to weigh them against the public interest in disclosure. And it may be more complicated if the information is internal. If it's too general, it affects public safety and also deals with intellectual property and the suggestion that you go through the credibility of the exceptions first, and then try and give them a value in some aggregating exercise. To balance is in my submission and the submission of the tribunals to deal with this unworkable or alternatively, you do what even the Court of Appeals said you do at the beginning, which is considered each exception in turn, see if it's applicable and then weigh it"
p1,00:46:00.410,00:46:38.210,spk_2,"Well the tidy way it strikes me is what we see. It pages 189 and 190. Bearing in mind, we're dealing with examples here, as Collins has said that as well from those apples and pears you've got, the line of thought is displayed quite fairly, I think, on these two pages as to what the public interest factors are in relation to each of these two. You could do it this way. I think I've grasped you as saying, If you did it the other way and simply identified the exceptions, you would have a third page, which would then set out to set out the factors, and you'd actually I'm pretty well the same paragraph's put in [inaudible] you say."
p1,00:46:38.480,00:46:56.030,spk_1,"You'd have to do it in the reasons why public interest favours withholding information. You wouldn't have that there for, page 189 and 190. You'd have that really would be your third page taking the applicable exemptions that we've identified, which"

And we say that situation is unreal, and I'll show you the tribunal decisions in the moment. It becomes more unreal when you're looking at the regulation. The exceptions in four and five together, because those are such inherently different, so qualitatively different in their nature. But it"
p1,00:47:19.760,00:48:18.270,spk_4,"doesn't matter that they're qualitatively different, because I think, among other things, that the case put the other way is to say, Well, you look at you do look at each of these. And of course, if no public interest in withholding disclosure arises where you can cross it off your list, but you could end up with a list of one to all or nearly all four and five. You then say, well, looking at all those in all those, the public interest in withholding the information exists on the other side. We think the following public interest arises in disclosure. In all the circumstances, we think the former, where's the latter? What is wrong with that approach?"
p1,00:48:18.280,00:49:39.590,spk_1,"What is wrong with that approaches in our submission? It does not firstly reflect the wording the Regulation's 12 and 4(14), which talks about identifying the exception. It's wrong as a matter of policy, because when we go back and I know you say, I'm not going back to the directive. But when you go back to the directive, what is clear is you're supposed to be having a policy in favour of disclosure. Disclosure is the general rule, and there has to be specific and defined circumstances in which you have disclosure. And you don't go into this kind of generalist aggregation of factors. And thirdly, my submission, it is unrealistic and will lead to odd results. It leads to not result in this case, as the tribunal found, because neither exception individually justify nondisclosure. So how can they justify non disclosure when you talk about it in the round? And generally, if you were to try and do it in a very complex way by dealing with application first, for all the exception that relied upon and then trying to give values to each of those to weigh against the public interest in disclosure. We say that is not something that the directive or indeed the regulation's contemplate. They contemplate that an exception would be relied upon. That's why Regulation 14 is in the terms that it says, You then decide whether the exception applies. And then you consider whether the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosure. And that's all you do."
p1,00:49:41.270,00:50:04.770,spk_0,"Your basic point is that I'm leaving aside the obvious incongruity of trying to put four and five together, although some of the factors inform may come in under five. For example, if you had a very broad defence and a very broad request, you might say it's more likely to give rise if honoured to disclosure of matters relating to national security,"
p1,00:50:05.160,00:50:06.070,spk_1,"for example,"
p1,00:50:06.080,00:50:25.000,spk_0,"your basic point is that these are not things can be accumulated to say there's a slight risk of a fair trial of an unfair trial, and to try and accumulate that with intellectual property protection is I think you're saying bizarre,"

It's not whether an absolutely hypothetical world could we think of a situation in which it may be possible to perform this aggregation exercise on a set of hypotheses. The question is what the draughtsman intend to be the process by which the policy of disclosure was maintained and exceptions were allowed only in specific and defined cases. And we say when you look at the wording of 12, when you look at the structure of 12 and the different types of exemptions that have to be complied with Regulation 14, which talks about specifying.

If a public authority wants to exempt themselves from that duty, they must say what exceptions they rely"

That is all the draughtsman intended to do. It leads to strange results as here, because neither of the two applicable exceptions justifies disclosure."

p1,00:51:43.240,00:52:28.680,spk_1,"there is no aggregate public interest, which is greater than the content of the two exceptions. If you try to do it differently by dealing with application, for all the potential exceptions first and then trying to have an aggregation of values for each of those particular exemptions, it would be very, very difficult in practice to do that. And therefore we say, If one comes back to the question of what does this draughtsman in a context where he was trying to make it easy for individuals to get access to information, and trying to make it easy for public authorities to know when they could and could not comply with such a request? That is the interpretation that the draughtsman adopted. We also say, and I'll show you the directive in just a moment that that is consistent with and we say, required by the director."

We don't know which ones he wants his factors to do with. If you like identifying what it is the person is after and that's foresee, then you get to defence. But at the moment,"

So it may well be that a request would trigger off different chains of thought. But to say he's asked for far too many telephone stations and they also belong to the American army.

It may well be that the very same telephone stations could be identified from the American equivalent of the Yellow Pages. So it may be they'll say, Well it looks worse than it is because in fact the information is readily available, and therefore the public interest in defence isn't actually here, one that outweighs the public interest in disclosure.

Neither exception justifies it. But somehow putting two in one sentence does and I will shortly be taking your Lordships' at the end of my submissions to a case called Bovis, which is the new information tribunal decision that has come out. And when you see Bovis, you'll see how the information Tribunal differently Constituted, is having very real difficulty with the kind of approach that Lord Justice Richards is dealing with. In fact, it may be helpful to take you to Bovis. Now it's a Tab 18 of Bundle 2. And in a nutshell My Lord, Bovis build's houses. And they wanted, they were making a planning application in South Gloucestershire, and there was an issue about what's called a Section 6 planning agreement. And Bovis wanted to get the appraisals that the council had made about this particular project. That Paragraph 2 and 3 and you'll see it three that has requested a copy of the appraisal they started off under Freedom Information Act. But in fact, they all recognise it was environmental information, and there were two exceptions relied upon, as you will see from 15 Paragraph 15(1), in fact, was a 12(4) exception. The request involves the disclosure of internal communications and the second was the 12(5) exception, disclosure would adversely affect the confidentiality of commercial information. The issue was set out at Paragraph 19."

This is an intellectual not mechanical or mathematical exercise aggregation seems to mean thinking about the public interests in favour of all applicable exceptions. At the same time, if on considering all the circumstances, the tribunal judges of the public interest in maintaining exception A is less important than the public interest in disclosure and that the public interest in maintaining exception B is also less important than the public interest in disclosure.

p1,01:08:50.290,01:09:04.240,spk_4,"yet something I'm not sure I understand. You see, when you get to 12, in effect, the public interest in disclosing the information is necessarily there."
p1,01:09:04.250,01:09:07.290,spk_1,"Yes, it is always that it is a given,"
p1,01:09:08.609,01:09:12.000,spk_4,"and it is necessarily there because of the directive,"
p1,01:09:12.569,01:09:21.250,spk_1,"because of the directive causes to have it there. But because it's required to have it there, it is implicit in five. That's what the Regulation"
p1,01:09:21.250,01:09:22.700,spk_4,5.
p1,01:09:22.910,01:09:24.770,spk_1,"It makes it a duty,"
p1,01:09:24.779,01:09:30.440,spk_4,but it isn't implicit in the regulations themselves looked at in complete isolation
p1,01:09:31.040,01:09:50.490,spk_1,in my solution. It is in Regulation 5. You impose duties on people because to do a duty is a good thing to impose a duty on an education authority to provide primary education for Children because the provision of primary education is a good thing. Imposed a duty on a public authority to disclose information that it holds because it is a good thing for it to do that.
p1,01:09:50.970,01:09:56.500,spk_3,That's six just worthwhile looking at the definition of environmental information.
p1,01:09:56.970,01:10:14.490,spk_1,"Yes, that's in, too. It's the same as in the directives. It happens. Yeah, yeah, And my lady is quite right. You will see the sorts of things there that are obviously public public factor. The public interest,"

And it's not for you, perhaps to answer what Lord Justice Richards meant by the last sentence in Paragraph 42 because he talks about the overall public interest. Now it wants to detach myself and look for something over arching over the particular factors mentioned in the letter. The overall public interest is page,"
p1,01:11:35.110,01:11:35.200,spk_1,and
p1,01:11:36.180,01:11:40.110,spk_2,the overall interests would be simply what we've just been talking about.

p1,01:11:44.020,01:11:47.920,spk_2,this is public information and there's a presumption in 12(2) and so on. And so
p1,01:11:47.930,01:12:39.920,spk_1,"there are limited exceptions, and they don't satisfy either exception because public safety nor intellectual property rights justify it. So to say, Well, we've gone through all of that. We know it's public information. We know it's a public body. We know that neither exception justifies non disclosure, but nonetheless, because of some overall in italics public interest, what is that and where does it come from? It does not come from the regulation's or from the directive. And it does not come from the regulation's or the directive, because the intention is that you show you shortly that the general rule is disclosure and it has to be specific and limited justification. And you do that by saying, Is this exception? Does it outweigh the interesting disclosure? Not by saying well, they both don't justify Look at them in the round or I'm just going to look at applicability and try and give them a mathematical value and come to account of washing machine mix at the end."

Could you then say, Well, the public interest in this particular case is exceptionally strong, not just that general view, that there should be transparency, that this disclosure will have a certain particular extreme beneficial effects. Are you precluded from doing"
p1,01:15:06.510,01:15:12.060,spk_1,"that in my submission? You can do that. I'm trying to think of an example, and it's not a good example, but I'm thinking about swine flu."
p1,01:15:12.640,01:15:13.030,spk_3,Say there
p1,01:15:13.030,01:16:10.940,spk_1,"was a suggestion that swine flu was something that resulted from a particular establishment emitting certain things into the environment. And that's where it began from, and there's an urgent and immediate need for Health Scotland or NHS Wales to try and find the source of the disease and so on. And somebody came along and says, Well this will affect my intellectual property rights. I can see a set of thinking which goes like this. Well, normally we accept that this would really adversely affect your property rights. And we have to weigh that against the general public interest. If you like the given public interest in disclosure information. And we think that on balance here, the commercial interests prevail. I can see a situation where the public interest is so immediate and great in having the information that it might strengthen that side of the equation and diminish the other side of the equation is possible. And that would seem to be consistent with Regulation 14 talks about the matters in the public interest balance, which must cover both sides."
p1,01:16:14.530,01:16:14.740,spk_3,The
p1,01:16:14.750,01:16:15.910,spk_1,general principles of

p1,01:16:30.820,01:16:32.870,spk_2,Absolutely clear by the directive.
p1,01:16:33.080,01:16:42.060,spk_1,"Yes, and it fits in all the circumstances and in all Regulation 14. And I wasn't saying no. I was saying yes and giving an example was flying"
p1,01:16:42.060,01:16:44.340,spk_2,"through. If you take nuclear emissions or something like that,"
p1,01:16:44.950,01:16:48.750,spk_1,"nuclear missions in many ways a better example than swine flu, which is hypothetical,"
p1,01:16:48.750,01:16:49.940,spk_2,and I just thought nuclear
p1,01:16:49.940,01:16:58.910,spk_1,emissions is better yes. So you can take account of specific features of the general desirability of disclosure. Public information?
p1,01:16:58.920,01:16:59.460,spk_3,Yes.
p1,01:16:59.470,01:17:19.550,spk_4,"So public interest in disclosing the information is self evident, but can be reinforced. And the balancing exercise, looking at the words in all the circumstances of the case, of particular factors that make it even more important that it should be in"
p1,01:17:19.550,01:17:23.450,spk_1,"that particular case, which makes the hurdle of justifying nondisclosure even harder."

p1,01:17:38.350,01:17:44.050,spk_2,thinking the Arrhus Convention is that the relevant party is the EU rather than member states.
p1,01:17:44.050,01:17:52.300,spk_1,"Yes, you are correct, My Lord. If you look at Recital 5 directly through the directive, if your Lordship looks a lot of Recital 5."
p1,01:17:52.310,01:17:52.740,spk_2,Yes.
p1,01:17:53.030,01:18:09.340,spk_1,"Is what you have said. Yes, they find it and they can be a party. And then they make a decision. And the Convention in just a moment. My Lord, we've looked at the Recital 1, which is the self evident public interest in these information. Then,"
p1,01:18:09.340,01:18:10.460,spk_3,"My Lord, if you look at"
p1,01:18:10.460,01:18:13.420,spk_1,"Article 8, it may answer My Lord Saville's point,"
p1,01:18:13.440,01:18:14.570,spk_3,it is necessary
p1,01:18:14.570,01:18:15.440,spk_1,to ensure
p1,01:18:15.980,01:18:16.540,spk_3,that any
p1,01:18:16.540,01:19:07.250,spk_1,"natural and legal person has a right of access to environmental information held by or for public authorities without having to state an interest. So we've seen in one self evident good we've seen an aid is necessary to have a right of access held by public authorities that you don't have to state an interest if your Lordship would go to regulation at the Recital 16 on the next page, and this is a very important recital. The right to information means that the disclosure of information should be the general rule and that public authorities should be permitted to refuse a request for environmental information in specific and clearly defined cases."
p1,01:19:09.320,01:19:09.710,spk_2,"Yes,"
p1,01:19:09.720,01:19:24.650,spk_1,that's the starting point. General rules got specific and defined justification if they're going to get out of that grounds. Plural for refusal should be interpreted in a restrictive way whereby the public interest served by disclosure
p1,01:19:25.120,01:19:25.420,spk_0,should
p1,01:19:25.420,01:19:33.680,spk_1,"be weighed against the interest served by the refusal. And we say that reading context, this means"
p1,01:19:33.680,01:19:34.380,spk_3,not that you have a
p1,01:19:34.390,01:19:44.150,spk_1,"generalist aggregation of the grounds for refusal, but you have to have a specific and clearly defined ground,"
p1,01:19:45.220,01:19:45.630,spk_3,and the
p1,01:19:45.630,01:19:47.910,spk_1,interest reflected in that ground
p1,01:19:48.170,01:19:49.040,spk_3,has to be weighed
p1,01:19:49.040,01:20:11.540,spk_1,"against the public interest in disclosure. And we say there are really two reasons for reading the recital in that manner. Firstly, the general rule and the fact that the exception is focused on there being a specific and clearly defined case justifying non disclosure. And secondly, you see the switch from grounds in the"
p1,01:20:11.540,01:20:12.850,spk_4,plural to
p1,01:20:12.860,01:20:42.080,spk_1,"interest served in the singular. And we say they're not saying look at all the grounds. Generally, what they're saying is, what is the specific interest served by the particular ground and weigh that against the public interest in disclosure, as we say, Is there a specific justification being advanced? Does that specific justification outweigh the public interest? And that is the two questions in 12(1). Is there an exception applicable? It's"
p1,01:20:42.080,01:20:52.450,spk_4,"not quite. Actually, 12(1) is slightly more restrictive, isn't it, because it talks about the public interest in applying the exception, whereas this only refers to the interest"
p1,01:20:52.830,01:21:40.180,spk_1,"of the public. Yes, so that's Regulation Recital 16, and that then feeds through into the directive noted Article 1 Objective Article 1. The objective's are to guarantee the right of access to environmental information held by public authorities and to set out the basic terms and conditions of practical arrangements for its exercise. That's what the directive wanted. And that's what we assume the draughtsman wanted. Not a mathematical exercise suitable for a try post paper but practical arrangements by which this right of ex access can be guaranteed and whereby refusals have to be justified in specific and clearly defined cases with that specific justification outweighs"
p1,01:21:40.420,01:21:41.110,spk_4,the public interest

p1,01:21:59.620,01:22:00.170,spk_3,at his
p1,01:22:00.170,01:22:06.840,spk_1,request and without having to state an interest. He doesn't have to justify why he wants
p1,01:22:08.120,01:22:09.890,spk_2,"Regulation 5,"
p1,01:22:10.200,01:22:13.620,spk_1,because Regulation 5 has to Article 3 right?
p1,01:22:14.400,01:22:15.330,spk_2,Sure.
p1,01:22:17.100,01:25:06.500,spk_1,"And then, My Lord, you get to four, which is headed exceptions and after one says member states may provide for a request for environmental information to refuse it. And then there are five set out, and they correspond to 12(4) of the regulation's and again there wants to do with the request being flawed in some way manifestly unreasonable in B two general in C, and we say, of course, if you look at 4(1)(d), it concerns unfinished documents or material the course of completion. We say the intention is considered, if that's the case, and then weigh it up and see if it justifies non disclosure. And if you reach that conclusion, if you look at the end of Article 4(1), this is where a request is refused on the basis that it concerns material in the course of completion. Then the authorities got to name the authorities preparing the material and the estimated time again, an indication that it's a looking at the exceptions individually. Does that apply? Does it, as we've seen, outweigh the public interest? If so, do what you can help the individual to get it. So that's an indication. The very fact that they're in a separate autumn is an indication that they be considered separately and not aggregated with 4(2), and we say separately within them. Then, if you look at 4(2) member states, may provide for a request for environmental information to be refused if disclosure of the information would adversely affect this is when it's looking outwards and adverse impact an adverse effect on specified interest, not some flaw in the request on material, and you see the various exceptions set out and then you go to four two after the list, it begins, and this is important. The grounds for refusing mentioned in one and two shall be interpreted in a restrictive way, taking into account for the particular case the public interest served by disclosure. In every particular case, the public interest served by disclosure shall be weighed against the interests served by the refusal. And this reflects the wording of the Recital 16 and what they are clearly focusing on by the shift and grounds in the plural of interest in the particular and bearing in mind 16. What they are talking about is the interest, the specific justification reflected in a particular ground of refusal. If that were not the case, then they would have said something very different. They would have said the interests served. Sorry, they would have said the interests served by the grounds of refusal rather than the interest, Sir."
p1,01:25:06.530,01:25:19.620,spk_2,"Taking the third line of that little paragraph, it talks about the public interest served by disclosure, not not the disclosure. So what is one to understand that phrase to mean?"
p1,01:25:22.290,01:25:22.510,spk_0,The
p1,01:25:22.520,01:25:23.600,spk_1,public disclosure?

p1,01:25:26.120,01:25:47.380,spk_1,"Exactly what My Lady has said. It is both general and may have particular facets within it. There is always the general belief that public bodies must give access to publicly held information about the environment. But there may be a particular facets about it as well and that's why you've got the doing. To counter the particular case, you've got the general and the particular."

Or raise the hurdle, I think you said in the particular case, but you've got the general starting point, which applies in every case,"
p1,01:26:10.680,01:27:14.310,spk_1,"correct. And then you've got to look at what the directive contemplated would be on the other side of the equation, and you bear in mind that four was the expression of the Recital 16. That disclosure of the general rule, and the public authority should be permitted to refuse a request only in specific and clearly defined cases. And then you have the switch from the grounds to the interests served. And in our submission, what was intended is that the actual interest served by a refusal, what is the interest in the particular ground has got to be weighed against the exception. And that fits with the general policy, the wording of the recital, and the emphasis that you're looking at a specific and defined case which outweighs the public interest in disclosure. You're not looking at a standing back and aggrandisement of general factors or an aggregation of general factors. You're not doing that. The emphasis throughout is on focus. You should disclose what's your specific reason for not disclosing? Does that reason outweigh the public interest? I"

Yes, there are grounds in 4(2), but you must look at the interests served by the refusal. What is the exception? What is the ground that you rely on? And you must weigh that against the public interest, including all the particular circumstances, the public interest in disclosure? That is what 4(2) says. That is the reflection of Recital 16 and the policy underlying the directive.

And in order to be able to assert this right and to ensure the duties observed, we must have access. That's the back cloth against which the Convention and then the regulation's were adopted. And if your Lordship go through, the treaty provisions Article 1 is the same basic guarantee.

p1,01:35:02.260,01:36:23.960,spk_1,"did not contemplate that there would be some kind of aggregation. There's nothing to suggest you would take something in 43 and added 2(4)(4). There's no reason to explain why 4(3) and 4(4) should be separate unless it is to recognise that they are qualitatively different exceptions and a different test is applicable and that you don't aggregate for three and 4(4) 4(3) allows you not to disclose if there's something wrong with the request of the information, 4(4) will entitle you not to disclose if it would have an adverse effect on an external interest. When you get to the regulation's, as I say, it treats four and five together sub four sub five and there's no possibility of saying you can aggregate five or you can aggregate four, but you don't have to agree. At four and five, it's all or nothing is quite clear that the drafting of the regulation's either replied the requirement that each be looked at individually. Or they contemplated that all the exceptions in sub four and sub five could be aggregated. And, as we say from our who's and from the directive, it is in our submission far more likely that when you're dealing with these different types of exceptions, there was no contemplation of aggregation by the draughtsman of our who's nothing to suggest. 4(3) and 4(4) would be aggregated, and that follows through in the directive."
p1,01:36:24.290,01:36:32.370,spk_2,"The directive follows the overall scheme or the Article 4 in each case, remarkably similar in their pattern,"
p1,01:36:32.380,01:36:55.960,spk_1,"Yes and it has to do that because Recital 5 says that provisions of community law must be consistent with the Convention.

p1,01:38:40.500,01:39:56.930,spk_1,"back from it so far, I have got the regulation's alone. We say support the deal. With each exception individually, does it apply? Does the exception outweigh the exception at the public interest in disclosure? That's the wording and the structure. Then I've got my directive, which I say does the same. And then I've got the, Arrhus Convention which certainly appears to do the same as well. And it sets the framework in the sense we're talking about information that individuals are entitled to. And there has to be a specific justifications, not a generalist overall aggregating public interest to refuse to disclose the last topic. I perhaps thought to deal with little briefly is the Court of Appeal decision and why the Court of Appeal decision is wrong. But I've set that out very fully in my case, and your Lords may feel that it's all in the case and when the regulation's were clearly intended to comply with the directive and the Arrhus Convention ultimately that references to the interpretation act doesn't apply. But there are other arguments that I put forward in the case, and I'm quite happy to leave it on the basis of the information set out in the case, or to run through the various arguments briefly in relation to, conscious of time."

And 37 how did they get there? And they got there by applying the interpretation act by saying the exception is in the plural and therefore short answers. Really. Firstly, Regulation 12 is simply setting out the circumstance in which the obligation does not apply."
p1,01:40:49.840,01:40:50.480,spk_0,You
p1,01:40:50.480,01:41:23.540,spk_1,"don't have to comply if you can show an exception, and that exception outweighs. If you haven't had a number of exceptions that you can rely on, you will have six reasons for not complying. But that goes nothing to telling you about the balancing exercise. All that Regulation 12 tells you when you don't have to comply. And the two circumstances that have to be satisfied or one that there's an exception is applicable and to the did outweighs nondisclosure, and you don't need to get into singular and plural at all. That's not the purpose of Regulation 12. Secondly,"

p1,01:41:24.460,01:42:30.710,spk_1,"if you look at Regulation 12 again, my Lords', which is in Tab 1 and 12, what the Court of Appeal was to say, Well, it must be the public interest singular in maintaining the exception or exceptions. But, My Lord, we say that the singular becomes the plural throughout, and it's the public interest or interests plural in maintaining the exception or exceptions. And once you have, that formulation is entirely neutral as to whether or not the balancing test has done one way or another. So the interpretation act doesn't apply, My friend says in reply, But there is only one public interest. No, there are different public interests. There are all the different interests set out, for example, in sub five, and we know that there are different interests plural, because the regulations refer to them as interests. Plural.

p1,01:43:24.560,01:43:36.340,spk_1,"There are specific exceptions, defined and limited exceptions, and the question is whether those exceptions apply. So that's the second reason. Firstly, this case is not about the single or the blue"

p1,01:43:37.870,01:43:49.450,spk_1,"if you apply Section 6, it applies to all of it, and it doesn't get you anywhere. Thirdly, the context in which this regulation is adopted is to give effect to the directive"
p1,01:43:49.460,01:43:50.200,spk_3,and are whose.
p1,01:43:50.200,01:44:48.310,spk_1,"And if we are right about the directive and are, then you would have to interpret the regulation's in accordance with the directive and the provisions of Section 6 of the interpretation that 1978 would be irrelevant. And then, fourthly, if you look at the internal indications in the regulation, it's clear that it's not meant to be plural or abandonment. If you look at the fact that there are two different exceptions set of exceptions in 12(4) and (5), if you look at the reference to any exception relied upon in Regulation 14. It's clear that the Draughtsman had throughout, in his or her mind the fact that there would be specific exceptions relied upon by the public authority to avoid its duty, and the task for the tribunal would be to consider the exception. Is it applicable? If so, does the exception that one relied upon justified,"
p1,01:44:48.690,01:44:50.010,spk_3,
p1,01:44:50.020,01:46:00.150,spk_1,"outweigh the public interest in non disclosure? So those are the four separate reasons by the Court of Appeal. Judgement is wrong in Paragraph 37. Firstly, this is not a case about singular and plural. It's a provision that sets out this circumstance conditions that must be met for an exception. Secondly, it doesn't assist because Section 6 would have to apply to interest and interests as well as exception or exceptions. Thirdly, you would have to comply with the directive, and that would displace the Interpretation act. And fourthly, the internal industry are that the Draughtsman was looking at the particular exception, weighed against the public interest in disclosure. And you see that from 12(4) and (5) and from Regulation 14, do you think, My Lord Your Lordship's further? Those would be the submissions on behalf of the appellant. There is one of the matter that I ought to be, which is the question of costs. I don't think it's dealt with in the case. As Your Lordship knows, we are two very friendly regulator's who have been litigating in a very friendly fashion throughout each side. Whoever has won has borne its own costs, and we're not asking."
p1,01:46:00.160,01:46:01.700,spk_2,So we would make no order

p1,01:47:15.540,01:48:21.200,spk_3,"legislation. We entirely accept that the Arrhus Convention and the directive and the regulation's have the overall policy objective of guaranteeing and facilitating a right of access to environmental information. And we also accept that the basis of that is the policy considerations that Mr Lewis has shown to the court concerning the general public interest in the making available of environmental information. But like so many fundamental rights, this is not an absolute right. It is a right which is exercisable, subject to conditions. And the question before this court is how those conditions are to be applied in the particular circumstances in which a single request for information engage is more than one of the exceptions, which are listed in Regulation 12(5)."
p1,01:48:21.210,01:48:27.440,spk_2,Can I put to the point I put at the very beginning just so we know we're standing? What your position is about a reference.
p1,01:48:27.730,01:50:15.840,spk_3,"Yes, Lord, our submission is that it is clear that there is no requirement in the Aarhus Convention or in the directive or in the regulation's, that each of the exceptions should be considered separately. On the contrary, in our submission, the natural meaning of all of those instruments and the underlying policy and we submit the consequences that flow the practical consequences that flow powerfully indicate that in fact, the correct approach where more than one exception is concerned is to look at the exceptions together and weigh them against the public interest in disclosure. And we submit that that being clear, there is no reason for a reference. We don't seek to submit that there is any significant difference at all between the regulation's and the directive. Of course, we accept that as My Lord Mance's put it, draughtsman here has been seeking to transpose international law the principles that are contained in the directive, and it's very unlikely that In doing that, he sought to draw any distinction between national law and the directive. Of course, if he had made national law less protective than the directive, he would be in breach of the directive and releasing principle would apply. But we submit it is equally unlikely that he sought to be more restrictive in permitting defences to public authorities to gold plate. The directive is equally unlikely that the two should be construed together as a harmonious code in our submission. And, of course, we accept that under the treaty, this court has a duty to refer. If this court concludes that the matter isn't that clear and that it would be determinative"

p1,01:50:16.830,01:50:17.480,spk_0,must be right.
p1,01:50:18.760,01:50:55.870,spk_3,"But it is not our preferred course, I've made the submission that essentially, what one has in this scheme is a right that is exercisable, subject to conditions, and the question is how you apply the conditions. This is, of course, a concept very familiar to our courts and a whole range of different context just to give an example. The many qualified rights that apply under the European Convention, where typically what you have is a paragraph that sets out right, such as the right to freedom of expression or the right to respect for private"

And we submit that what that structure reflects is a situation in which there has to be a balance in determining where the overall public interest lies. Does it? Does the public interest lie in the protection of the fundamental right? Or is there some other specific public interest which the state is able to invoke, which overrides the right? And in all such cases, you start from the presumption that the right must be enforceable unless there's an exception which overrides it. But it doesn't follow from that that if the state, for example, were able to say well, there are reasons to do with the protection of the rights of others and reasons to do with the prevention of disorder or crime, both of which justify a particular interference with the fundamental right. It doesn't follow that the right approach is to say, Well first of all we're only going to"

And then we're going to do a separate balancing exercise, and this time we're going to take the prevention of disorder or crime and weigh that in my submission, that is never the approach that's adopted and it would be a most extraordinary way of proceeding"
p1,01:52:31.840,01:53:18.980,spk_2,"because -- well the draughtsman of the regulation's, said quite a tidy mind. I think it's right to say if you look at Paragraph 14, which may be the way in which one begins the exercise are he's looking at the public authority, which is wanting to refuse to take itself out of the general rule. And obviously there's an exercise to be gone through, and we see how it set out in in Regulation 14, particularly 14(3). Yes, there's an obligation to specify thinks the mind has to be brought to bear, and it's exercise which identifies. You've got to identify your exception and then you've got to look particularly be to explain if you are in this mind of refusal. What the matters are that you've taken into account --"
p1,01:53:19.050,01:53:48.980,spk_3,"Absolutely, we submit that that entirely supports our position because, as my learned friend rightly says, what one has here is a strict scheme where there are a limited number of factors that may be relied upon as a reason for not disclosing information. They are exhaustively set out in our house in the directive and the regulation's absolutely correct that a public authority is not entitled to say,"

p1,01:53:56.670,01:53:57.820,spk_2,"So there's no overall,"
p1,01:53:57.820,01:54:34.540,spk_3,"there's no interest. There's no residual, no residual public interest, which is not specified, it is incumbent upon the state. Just This is why I drew the analogy with Article 8 because in Article 8 of the Convention you have a number of legitimate aims that are identified in eight to the state's got to bring itself within the ambit of one of those. Similarly, here we have a very detailed and specific list of public interest factors that the state is permitted to pray in aid if it wishes to decline to disclose information and those must be specified. If we look at Regulation 14"

p1,01:54:54.570,01:55:08.830,spk_2,"You say these are very carefully defined and it's a list which can't be expanded. Yes, it's following our hosts and so on and so forth. And therefore, it would be wrong to say that as it were, an overall public interest in non disclosure,"
p1,01:55:09.440,01:55:53.540,spk_3,"Well, you know, my in my submission no part of our case is that it is wrong to seek to divide up the public interest in that way and say, as my learned friend just did. There are lots of different public interests. There is only one public interest. In any case, I'm going to show your Lordships' a little later. The case of Wiley, which is, of course, the public interest immunity case where this point is dealt with by Lord Wolf. There's only one public interest in any case, and what the public authority or the information tribunal or this court is seeking to do in every case is to identify where the public interest lies and in every case, whether the public interest favours disclosure, which is the presumption or favours non"

p1,01:55:54.740,01:56:36.640,spk_3,"There are different aspects to the public interest on both sides of the equation. And this goes to a point that My Lord Saville made a little earlier that in this case there are particular aspects to the public interest in disclosure, epidemiological research and people knowing about the location of mobile phone base stations, as well as the general public interest in disclosure. That's described in the first paragraph of the recital to the directive in parenthesis. Actually, the public interest in disclosure in this case was relatively low, and the reason it was relatively low is because most of the information that the public need about mobile phone base stations is already in the public domain."
p1,01:56:37.200,01:56:45.050,spk_2,Specific is it? The point is made. You can't actually say precisely where it is within the given. You don't know whether it's up a tyre on a church to --
p1,01:56:45.060,01:57:07.400,spk_3,"Yes, that's right, but for most people's purposes, the reason most people want to know where mobile phone base station is is they may be buying a house. They may be looking for a school for their children, and they're concerned about the effect of emissions on their children. And therefore they want to know what mobile phone base stations are in the area. They can go to the well they might. Well, indeed,"
p1,01:57:07.850,01:57:09.560,spk_1,"absolutely,"
p1,01:57:09.560,01:58:53.120,spk_3,"My Lady. And indeed, there was some fascinating evidence that showed, in fact, the more mobile phone base stations you have, the safer you are because the lower the power of the emissions is when you don't have enough mobile phone base stations that you have higher emissions. But absolutely, My Lady, that you may indeed want to know whether you've got coverage on your 3G network. And so there are lots of reasons why the public may want to know, and they can access that information through the site finder website. It will tell them where they're a pretty good degree of accuracy, actually, where the mobile phone base stations are, who owns them and lots of information about the actual characteristics of the station in question. but it won't give them the exact grid reference. And that was the real issue. The exactly, exactly pinpointing, and it won't give it to him on a national database. And the point was that this particular researcher wanted the whole of the national data set so as to do some statistical research. And Your Lordships' and Your Ladyship will have seen that there was an argument about that and the impact it had on intellectual. But the submission I'm making is simply that the extent of the public interest on both sides of the equation has different aspects in every single case and may have different force. Now, my friend gave an example of a situation where the public interest in disclosure may be much greater his swine flu example or the nuclear emissions example. But there are also cases, and we submit. This is one of them where the public interest in disclosure is relatively low because of the information that's already in the public domain. So this is not this is not a swine flu case, but one has to look at the particular circumstances and assess the weight of the public interest in all of its aspects in favour of disclosure. On one side of the equation,"
p1,01:58:53.180,01:59:21.040,spk_2,"the equation looks different, hasn't it? If I've understood it correctly, that on one side you've got the duty or the general rule or whatever it is, which is presumption is a presumption in favour and so and so forth, which is perfectly general and can be made even more powerful by invoking particular aspects of it that applies to the particular case. But it is an irreducible element on that side, whereas on the other side, on the negative side, it's a very specific list."
p1,01:59:21.180,01:59:21.810,spk_3,"Specifically,"
p1,01:59:21.820,01:59:31.440,spk_2,"you've got to bear in mind that the question is unbalanced to that extent that you've got this this list which can be expanded, which is interests against --"
p1,01:59:32.320,02:00:54.100,spk_3,"Yes, My Lord, I accept that and of course, that's also the case when you're looking at a qualified human right that you have an unbalanced equation on one side of the equation, you have a fundamental right, and on the other you have specific and limited interests of the state, which may over override that right in the particular case. So, yes, I accept that. But the question is, then how do you deal with the other side of the equation, and my submission is that it's wrong to say each of these exceptions constitutes a different public interest, and each is to be taken separately and weighed against the assessed public interest in disclosure. That's wrong in principle, because what you are seeking to do, whether you're the public authority or the court, is to assess the overall public interest in the terms that you are permitted to do it by the legislation. So you're not permitted to assess the public interest against disclosure by taking into account a factor that is, by statute irrelevant. You're only allowed to take into account these factors, which are the only relevant factors. But in my submission, if you have two or more of them, which apply, so you have two or more adverse effects on different aspects of the public interest than in my submission. It is absolutely correct to take those together and weigh them together against all the aspects of the public interest in favour of disclosure."
p1,02:00:54.110,02:00:55.700,spk_2,Can you imagine an example?
p1,02:00:55.710,02:00:56.140,spk_3,"Yes,"

p1,02:00:57.790,02:01:24.840,spk_3,"Yes, let me let me give the court and two examples the first example As the court knows there is a presumption in favour of disclosure. So if the two writes, if the right sorry, if the interest in favour of disclosure is equal to the public interest in maintaining the exception, the material must be"

In my submission, it is not only legitimate but necessary for the tribunal, then to take into account that there is another adverse effect on the public interest arising from disclosure and to say, Well, that also has an impact. And those two taken together"
p1,02:02:05.830,02:02:06.880,spk_1,outweigh the public
p1,02:02:06.880,02:02:28.450,spk_3,"interest in disclosure. And in my submission, Well, My Lord, My Lady, in my submission, what you then have is a situation where there are adverse effects on two different aspects of the public interest. Each of those is equal to the public interest in disclosure. So taken together, they outwit."
p1,02:02:28.630,02:02:29.520,spk_2,Otherwise you give
p1,02:02:29.520,02:04:00.640,spk_3,"no weight at all to one of those factors. It's the classic public law situation where you must take into account all relevant considerations. If you have. Yes, you have one. The interests are equal. Yes. Factor Two exceptions to the interests are equal. Yes, but they're different. Different interests on the negative side. Well, obviously the disclosure interest may be the same. In each case, they will be the nondisclosure interest. Yes, well, I could probably think of examples where they wouldn't be. The public interest answer on disclosure might be different. A different answer on some of the exceptions than the other one could possibly imagine. That you've been thinking about this much longer than I have. And I haven't yet got to my head. But never mind. All I'm trying to say is I'm trying to understand your sums. Yes. Exception. One interest equal. Yes. So obviously, you apply the presumption of whatever view of what the presumption you apply the presumption in favour of disclosure exception to interest equal. So again, if I was treating them separately, one would apply the presumption flavour disclosure. But you say the fact that you have to mean somehow or other you taught up those two, but you don't get double weight to those two. Yes. And the lady? The reason The reason is that what? What? What you're doing when you when you taught"

p1,02:04:02.100,02:04:43.550,spk_3,"is that you are identifying the fact that there are two adverse effects on the public interest that arise from the disclosure of this information. You're saying, what is the public interest in favour of the disclosure of this information? Well, it will. It will improve debate on the environment and give people better access. So that's the public interest in favour of disclosure. Then you say, What is the public interest on the other side of the equation? And the answer is, there are two adverse effects that disclosing this information will have. Firstly, it will have an adverse effect on, say, international"
p1,02:04:43.550,02:04:44.370,spk_1,relations or national

There's a separate interests, both will be adversely affected, and we submit that if both of those aspects of the public interest are adversely affected, they must be considered together because I'm still having trouble. I made my point. I'm still having trouble understanding how if neither of those is individual taken alone to outweigh the public interest in disclosure. Putting them together makes any difference because you are introducing into the equation a whole new set of adverse effects on the public interest and indeed, one of the points that was made earlier to"

But logically, if your points good, it must be sufficient that there was quite a week risk of unfair trial. I mean, 26% would be enough if you had to. 26% risks you add them together, and then bingo, you've got 52%. And the public interest is disclosures outweighed. It seems to me that's"

But what you don't then say is the public interest is another 100. So, in other words, on my very simple example. 100 as against 200."
p1,02:06:43.680,02:07:12.990,spk_3,"Now, can I just address my was? Yes, My Lord. But can I just address My Lord Lord Mance's point? Because, of course, it's right to say that in practical terms, if both of the interests against disclosure are very weak, it is unlikely that considering them together is going to make much difference to your overall judgement. It's likely to be in the borderline case where this is going to make a difference."

p1,02:08:09.960,02:08:43.180,spk_0,"alternative does make sense. If you look, I look at each of the hurdles which has been put up, and I conclude that they can all be overcome. And that's the end of the matter. Normally, in much reasoning, if you're faced with the problem whether to build a house here, there or whatever, you might well adopt a sequential approach. You don't you don't say, Well, there are awful lot of difficulties. I can overcome each of them, but nonetheless together that they are fatal. They mean this project impossible,"
p1,02:08:43.290,02:11:01.520,spk_3,"My Lord, with respect, you might well conclude that each of the obstacles to building your house taken alone, might not make the house an impossible project. But the five taken together rendered it completely uneconomic. That may indeed be at your process of reasoning, but can I just come back to a point that your Lordship made earlier this morning making the point that the interests in regulation for 12(5) are quite different from each other? So, for example, in this case, we have an effect on public safety and crime, and we also have an adverse effect on intellectual property rights. now in my submission, if you start from the proposition that if the tribunal had found in this case that the adverse effect on crime and public safety of disclosing this information was equal to the public interest in disclosure and then the tribunal says, Well, actually there is also another adverse effect that arises from disclosure. This case, it's a completely different type of adverse effect. It's the adverse effect on the intellectual property rights of the mobile operators. In my submission. It is wrong to leave that out of account when you do the balancing exercise, because what you're seeking to do in my submission is not to look at each obstacle but to assess whether the overall public interest does or does not favour disclosure. And what you've got is a situation where you have already determined that disclosure will have two different adverse effects on the public interest, and we submit both of those Adverse effects must be taken into account when you seek to weigh them against the public interest in disclosure. Now that can be graphically or numerically represented in My Lord Saville's equation that you still have 100 on the side of disclosure and you have 100 for each of the adverse effect. But in my submission, why doesn't need to adopt and a mathematical mathematical approach. It's the normal public law approach of assessing all the factors. And that, of course, is the approach that would be taken if we were looking at any other kind of qualified."
p1,02:11:01.530,02:11:19.010,spk_2,"We're constrained to some extent. Surely, by the way, the regulation's are set out. If you look at Regulation 12(5), which we're talking about, it talks about to the extent that, yes, and you've got your list and it ends up just before G with the word or"

How are you going to present your argument? Are you going to say, where is your justification? None of them will actually overcome the presumption. So to the extent that it would interfere with each of these, it doesn't succeed. How are you going to do it? I don't understand how it's going to be presented."
p1,02:11:51.460,02:12:27.520,spk_3,"Well, let me give an example and which directly addresses the structure of the regulation's.

p1,02:12:52.900,02:12:58.060,spk_3,and each interest is to be separately weighed against the public interest in

p1,02:12:59.200,02:15:59.340,spk_3,"Paragraph 1. We have international relations, defence, national security or public safety. Now, of course, I accept there's an overlap between these concepts, but there are differences, significant differences. Let us take national security and international relations. One only has to consider a case like the corner house case, which some of this court will will recall, or the Binyam Mohamed case. To understand that there is a very significant difference between an adverse effect on international relations and an adverse effect on national security. You may well have a situation and indeed situation which is shortly going to be occupying the Court of Appeal in the Binyam Mohamed case, where it is said, disclosure of this information would cause great offence to our international partners and therefore have an adverse effect on international relations. That's one question. Another question is disclosure of this information would have an adverse effect on our national security because it would cause our international partners to take retaliatory action against us, perhaps with withholding intelligence cooperation. Those are different questions and different factors, and one can imagine easily. In fact, I've just given your Lordships' and your leadership to real cases where those separate interests are both engaged. And in the Binyam Mohamed case, both engaged by a question involving the disclosure of information and in my submission, Can it realistically be said that when considering the question whether the maintenance of the exception we would say maintenance of exceptional exceptions and come back to the actual drafting points later outweighs the public interest in disclosure that it is wrong for the National Court or the public authority to consider both the effect on international relations and the effect on national security. Together we submit, that is plainly an impossible construction of this legislation and, if adopted, would be liable to lead to the forced disclosure of information in circumstances where it was plainly contrary to the public interest for that material to be disclosed. And I give that example because it's a very easy way in my submission to see that the argument well a doesn't outweigh, be see doesn't outweigh B. Therefore, a plus B cannot outweigh B is with respect, not correct, that when you consider A and C together as a whole the overall effect on the public interest, the defined public interest, the permissible public interest they may taken together outweigh the public interest in disclosure. In whether you call that an arithmetical approach or an overall approach, or simply, we would say simply, the weighing of both sides of the equation. The public interest"

First of all, the public authority must specify any exception relied on now that obviously is envisaging that there may be more than one exception relied on and indeed, it's common ground that there will be many circumstances in which there's more than one exception relied on.

Then we come to 12(1)(b) in all the circumstances of the case. That's the starting point here, suggesting an evaluation in the round and by reference to the specific facts. The public interest in maintaining the exception outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information, and my only friend has to submit that that must be read as the public interest in maintaining each exception considered separately outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information and we submit that it's natural. Meaning is public interest in maintaining whatever exception is relied upon whatever exceptional exceptions are relied upon. Now, whether that means that the single includes the plural. Or if you've got a list of five, you're relying on five. And if there's a difference between those, the result is the same that it's looking to an overall evaluation between two sides of an equation. One side. Whatever factors the public authorities relying upon against disclosure and on the other side, the factors relied upon in favour. So that's the starting point. We then have the presumption in favour of disclosure, which the courts already seen. We then have the specific exceptions at four and five. We then have Regulation 12(6). Now, Melanie friends talk to rely on this, but not to read out the last part of it. Public authority may respond to a request by neither confirming nor denying whether such information exists and is held by the public authority, whether or not it holds such information. If that confirmation or denial would involve the disclosure of information which would adversely affect any of the interests referred to in Paragraph 5(a) and would not be in the public interest under Paragraph 1(b) and in my submission, the distinction there between the individual interests that are listed, the individual exceptions or interests that are listed under 51 under 12(5) and the public interest under Paragraph 1(b), which is, of course, the matter that we're concerned with is significant because that in my submission strongly supports my contention. But what we're seeking to do here is to discern where the balance of the public interest as a whole lies not to consider separate interests separately. We then have regulations."

p1,02:25:05.960,02:25:42.260,spk_3,"And I understand the point. That's the alternative to the first to the way that you can actually put it. My learned friend actually puts it, as I understand it, that each of these interests, as a separate exception, must be separately weighed. The alternative is the way that Your Lordship puts it to me, which is that each sub paragraph is to be treated as a separate exception and that interests within the sub paragraph can be aggregated. But interests between the sub paragraphs may not. In my submission, the first objection to that is why, with respect is a wholly arbitrary way of approaching."
p1,02:25:42.270,02:25:58.420,spk_0,"I think the point I was putting was that it's not arbitrated arbitrary that there is a common theme, and the problem that you face is that when you come to the aggregation of a B, C, D E F G, there isn't any common underlying theme. They are desperate."
p1,02:26:00.020,02:26:17.490,spk_3,"The difficulty with respect with that argument is that they're playing. They are common themes between the other interest, and they are not desperate. For example, at sea, we have intellectual property rights at E. We have the confidentiality"

We have the interests of the person who provided the information where he wasn't under a legal obligation, didn't supply it in circumstances that he could be required to and hasn't consented to its disclosure. Now that's an example in my submission of three separate paragraphs where you have closely related and interlocking, writes commercial confidentiality, intellectual property and voluntarily provided information. But there will also be many circumstances in which quite different rights will be engaged by the same request. Leaving aside this case for a moment and going back to Binyam Mohamed, there are, in fact, three rights that are potentially engaged by the disclosure of the information the Binyam Mohamed case one is international relations. One is national"

Because it could be argued in the Binyam Mohamed case that the disclosure of the material, which tends to show the complicity of M.

p1,02:27:39.080,02:28:05.280,spk_2,"Well, if that's helpful example, but I can't see that there may be another leopard they exercise. I would expect you to carry it out is to look at a first and set out what you consider to be the the interest grounds for withholding the information. And then you come to be and you do the same, and you may see immediately when you set them out that there is an overlap, and then you can you can weigh them up in that way. But"
p1,02:28:05.290,02:29:22.260,spk_3,"my love with respect, the overlap is not the point. The point is we have to be very careful how we use the word overlap. The point is that it's the same information yes, which engages different aspects of the public interest. That's the overlap I'm not making the point here. That the same public interest could be could be characterised in different ways under different paragraphs. What I'm saying is that you may have the same request for information that may engage different aspects of the public interest. Let me continue with the Binyam Mohamed example overwhelming public interest found by the court in that case, overwhelming public interest in favour of disclosure of the information but very powerful national security reason for not disclosing the information. And suppose that the court concluded that the National Security and International Relations Objections two disclosing that information exactly balanced the public interest in its disclosure. And then it was said, Well, there is also a different adverse effect on the public interest, and that is the impact on the individuals getting a fair trial now, in my submission, it would not be necessary in that situation. Of course, this is assuming its environmental information,"

It would be sufficient to say You must look at all of the different ways in which the public interest the single public interest is adversely affected by a requirement to disclose this material. And they include international relations, national security and fair trial rights. And each of those must be weighed in the balance against against the public interest in disclosure. So my submission, you simply cannot draw any sort of principled distinction between the interests that are contained within a single paragraph in Regulation 12(5) and the interests that are apportioned to separate paragraph's. It's a structure that has flowed through the international European regulations, but never with any suggestion in any instrument that that structure has any impact on the way in which the relative public interest factors to be balanced.

p2,00:00:38.440,00:01:11.340,spk_3,"My lords, my lady, we were looking at the regulations, and I'm responding to the submission that there are in some way different public interests that are represented by the different Exceptions contained regulations 12 4, 12 5. Which is a proposition that we say is incorrect and also that there is some fundamental distinction to be drawn between the notion of weighing the public interest in maintaining the exceptional exceptions against the public interest in disclosure and deciding whether the balance of the public interest favours disclosure or non-disclosure. That's the other part of my Learned friend's case, that there's a fundamental distinction between those concepts. Now we accept that that is right in this respect, as I've already made clear, that we accept that the only aspects of the public interest that can legitimately be taken into account in deciding not to disclose are those which are listed that that is an exhaustive list. But we submit that that is all that is meant in regulation 12 1.b, when the contrast is drawn between the public interest in maintaining the exception and the public interest in disclosing the information is simply emphasising the fact that it is only the aspects of the public interest which are envisaged and included in the exceptions that may be weighed against the public interest in disclosure. Now,"

p2,00:01:13.270,00:02:05.850,spk_3,
p2,00:02:05.860,00:02:23.290,spk_0,"you say just to catch on to the terminology here, if you look as I was asking Mr Lewis to do at the last sentence of paragraph 42 in the Court of Appeal, where Lord Justice Richards refers to the overall public interest. Sorry, it's page 18 in the appendix."
p2,00:02:23.840,00:02:24.350,spk_1,"Mm,"
p2,00:02:25.140,00:02:25.340,spk_0,"yeah,"
p2,00:02:27.940,00:02:28.140,spk_1,yeah.
p2,00:02:30.940,00:02:40.240,spk_0,"You see the penultimate line, the overall public interest, you say? Well, that's all. Well, it's got to be within specified in the list. You can't go beyond that."
p2,00:02:40.250,00:05:43.060,spk_3,"Yes, that's right. But what I'm really doing here is addressing the point that my lady, Lady Hale has put that she has said, Well, how can it make a difference if you've got two exceptions engaged and neither alone is sufficient to outweigh the public interest in disclosure? Then how can it make a difference if you've take them together? And that's the same point that my Learned friend put we submit. It does make a difference if you take them together and one sees this in many different contexts. And I gave the example of the public interest immunity context that Binyam Mohamed context, that you can't say that because international relations alone doesn't outweigh the interest in disclosure, that looking at national security as well won't have that effect, or that looking at the interests of justice as well won't have that effect. If you've got three different aspects of the public interest engaged against disclosure, considering them together may make a difference. Now I fully accept that there will be circumstances where it doesn't make a difference, and I don't suggest that you do make a simple mathematical calculation. What I do submit is that it is wrong to leave wholly out of account when weighing the two sides of the equation one whole aspect of the public interest, which is both relevant and engaged. They must be taken into account. Now you may conclude that when both of the public interests are taken into account, neither alone is strong enough to outweigh the interest in disclosure, and the same is true when they're taken together. But my submission is simply that the alternative solution is also a possible one, and that there is an obligation on the court or tribunal to consider it. And what is wrong is to is to conduct the balancing exercise, shutting your eyes entirely as this tribunal did to one of the factors found to be engaged. And if the court reads back the information tribunal decision, what you will see is that their decision making procedure as follows, they said. First of all, we're looking at crime and public safety, and we find that disclosing all these details will assist criminals and could cause damage the network and put public safety in jeopardy. But we don't think to a very great extent, and we weigh that against the public interest in disclosure, we find it doesn't outweigh it. Then we look at intellectual property and we find that there is an adverse effect. It affects the ability commercially to exploit. Also, they found that there was a likely adverse effect on the amount of information that will be made available as an ironic outcome of this case, which is in fact less environmental information is now available than was previously. But so then they said there's an adverse effect, their then they said when we're looking at this, we leave entirely out of account the adverse effect on crime and public safety because that's a different exception in my submission. That's the error and approach. Now. I absolutely accept that they could lawfully have come to the same conclusion taking both together. But the submission is that there's an error of approach and that the necessary weighing of the two factors together has not been undertaken. So"
p2,00:05:43.060,00:05:44.950,spk_1,"A shame this wasn't a better case, really. Isn't it"

p2,00:05:49.220,00:06:28.730,spk_3,"my lady. Of course, I want to make one thing very clear here, which is that Ofcom is the regulator. Ofcom is not seeking to prevent the public having access to environmental information Ofcom in a situation where it has to deal with requests for environmental information and under freedom of information, act very regularly. It is therefore, very important to Ofcom that it knows what is the right approach. Legally, that it ought to adopt to those requests. And of course we didn't bring this appeal. Of course, we did bring the appeal to the court of appeal. We didn't bring this appeal to the Supreme Court, but I do want to make it clear that Ofcom is not pursuing any agenda here concealing environmental information, not"

p2,00:06:42.360,00:07:34.220,spk_3,"It may not have made it, but that's why I give your Ladyship Binyam Mohamed example, because in order for my Learned friend to succeed, he has to persuade the cord that where different aspects of the public interest are engaged against disclosure, aggregating them can never make a difference to the overall balance. He has to go that far because otherwise he has to confront what I say is the meaning of the end of paragraph 42 of the Court of Appeals judgement, which is that the necessary conclusion of his argument is that there may be cases in which the public authority and the court are bound to order the disclosure of the information, even though it is against the relevant, engaged public interest. To do"
p2,00:07:34.220,00:07:38.850,spk_4,"so, can you get to the same result by the phrase in all the circumstances of the case,"
p2,00:07:39.110,00:07:49.650,spk_3,"my lord, In my submission, you can. And this is also a point that was made by the Court of Appeal at paragraph 37 of their judgement at page 17."
p2,00:07:52.040,00:07:52.540,spk_1,"Yeah,"
p2,00:07:53.240,00:07:54.020,spk_3,"yeah, over"
p2,00:07:54.020,00:07:56.360,spk_0,the last sentence. Yes.
p2,00:07:57.540,00:08:18.590,spk_3,"Yeah. The aggregate approach is also favoured by the reference and Caribbean to all the circumstances of the case. And, Lord, I would respectfully submit that that directs you to the right analysis, which is considered the factors, the relevant factors on one side, the relevant factors on the other and conduct the overall weighing."
p2,00:08:18.650,00:08:36.200,spk_4,"My point was that that phrase allows you to take into account headings where the public interest doesn't outweigh the interest protected, but nevertheless allows you to take it, take it into account."
p2,00:08:36.210,00:08:39.659,spk_3,"Yes, I would. I agree with that. Yes."
p2,00:08:40.039,00:08:55.840,spk_5,"Well, the alternative is that it simply requires you when weighing the particular interest. Um, referred to in four or five. You look at all the circumstances. Yeah,"
p2,00:08:56.840,00:08:57.210,spk_3,but
p2,00:08:57.220,00:09:13.240,spk_5,I don't know what his new you can I can't see. You can get any positive conclusion from the reference to all the circumstances of the case that you're looking at other interests other than the particular one protected by a particular exception.
p2,00:09:13.410,00:09:41.260,spk_3,"Well, except that it would be odd if you had a situation in which to relevant statutory interests were engaged and you were directed to consider all the circumstances of the case. If the meaning of the drafting room was, in fact, that when considering the weighing exercise, there should never be a complete consideration of all the relevant circumstances together but that there should only be separate considerations of particular factors."
p2,00:09:41.270,00:09:54.840,spk_5,"Obviously, some of the factors relevant on one were also relevant on the other. You wouldn't need to refer to the one because they come in any way under the other. So it will be part of the circumstances under either exception, whichever you were considering"
p2,00:09:54.900,00:10:19.700,spk_3,"with respect. I think that is the confusion between the overlap in the information they're overlapping, the request and the overlapping the interest so that the request for a particular piece of information may have an adverse effect on both international relations and national security. Those are two distinct interests. The same information."
p2,00:10:19.820,00:10:22.050,spk_5,I think we're simply talking about something within a

p2,00:10:27.600,00:11:41.870,spk_0,"I'm still unclear. I'm afraid as to how you would present this following the exercise. Regulation 14 asked to carry out this case probably isn't a very helpful example because you took the position. Two exceptions did apply, and that's presented very neatly. Pages 1891 90. But let's assume that you have not been persuaded taking them individually, that the threshold was crossed and the presumption therefore overrode the exceptions. How are you going to present it? Because you can't assert taking them individually, that either either a or C is in each of them separately as a ground. So what's going to happen? You're going to say, uh, are you going to say both exceptions apply if you accumulate them or you're going to say, Well, one of them applies because taking a little bit from a C can be can be given enough weight to overcome the presumption presumption of what? I just don't quite see how you can actually carried out this exercise. In a way, I'm asking that question because I suspect that's what the tribunal chairman of telling us that they found it difficult to know how to grapple with the problem in practise."
p2,00:11:42.340,00:12:17.150,spk_3,"In my submission, the distinction needs to be drawn between the exception applying and the outcome of the balancing exercise. Being a decision that there should be no disclosure, there's a two stage process that is envisaged. The first question is, is there an adverse effect on the particular interest? So the first question is, if we look at regulation 12 five Hey,"
p2,00:12:17.740,00:12:19.180,spk_0,so you say Yes.
p2,00:12:19.190,00:12:20.070,spk_3,Is there an adverse
p2,00:12:20.070,00:12:21.330,spk_0,effect? Yes.
p2,00:12:21.340,00:12:23.410,spk_3,Is there an adverse effect on this interest?

p2,00:12:24.340,00:12:44.350,spk_3,"and you can go through and you can identify all of the interests that you say. There is an adverse effect on if this material is disclosed. So in this case, Ofcom says there is an adverse effect on public safety and there is an adverse effect on intellectual property rights."
p2,00:12:45.460,00:12:46.100,spk_0,So
p2,00:12:46.100,00:12:48.210,spk_3,those exceptions are both engaged
p2,00:12:48.330,00:12:55.490,spk_0,and you'll explain. You have to explain each one. You list them in your annex and these are the reasons
p2,00:12:55.500,00:13:18.940,spk_3,"you say that this is the adverse effect. You'd say this data belongs to the mobile operators, right? We have a limited licence to use it, but not a limited licence to disseminate it further. If that material is disclosed, there is more than simply a technical infringement of intellectual property rights because their ability commercially to exploit the data is interfered with. And they"
p2,00:13:18.940,00:13:19.740,spk_2,can't police
p2,00:13:19.750,00:13:24.510,spk_3,breaches of their intellectual property rights. So there's an adverse effect on their intellectual property
p2,00:13:24.510,00:13:25.570,spk_0,"rights. Yes,"
p2,00:13:25.660,00:15:04.120,spk_3,"and you say there's an adverse effect on public safety because the precise information about the precise location of the masks and the national network will assist criminals to in theft and sabotage. So those are your adverse effects thin? You identify the public interest in favour of disclosure, and that will be in part, the general points identified in recital one of the directive and also will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. So you identify the public interest in favour of disclosure, then I absolutely accept. The logical way to proceed is to look at one exception against the public interest, because if you find that the first exception that the public interest there outweighs the public interest in disclosure, that's going to be sufficiently to decide not to disclaim. So as the Court of Appeal suggested it will often be convenient to weigh each of the exceptions separately against the public interest in disclosure. But at that point, if you found you had more than one exception that was engaged. So you've got more than one adverse effect. As the Court of Appeals said again, you need to consider the whole equation and say, Well, if we take both of these questions together, national security and international relations and the effect on, um, a fair trial and weigh them together against the public interest in disclosure, do the does the public interest in maintaining those exceptions considered together outweigh the public interest in disclosure."
p2,00:15:04.130,00:15:30.680,spk_0,"So, as a matter of presentation, you could have a letter, which is similar to what we see. 187 with an NX in which you would list your two or three exceptions, which are engaged. You would identify the factors that you've taken into account, and the overall conclusion would be in the letter in which you will be able to say, picking up Lord Connor's point in all the circumstances of the case. You withhold information. Is that the way in which it could be done on your argument."
p2,00:15:30.920,00:15:32.660,spk_5,"You have to list all the exceptions,"
p2,00:15:33.040,00:15:38.050,spk_3,only those that you found your engaged. But that's the That's the position anyway.
p2,00:15:38.640,00:15:43.220,spk_0,"Well, that that sets the parameters for review when it goes to the commissioner."
p2,00:15:43.490,00:16:00.870,spk_3,"Of course, other parties may seek to bring in other exceptions. What may happen is, as in this case, you have a private operator, T Mobile, who says, Actually, there is a much more severe impact on crime and become appreciates and with the people with the evidence. And they showed that tribunal"
p2,00:16:01.430,00:16:06.880,spk_0,you cover yourself in the last sentence of the letter by saying there may be other exceptions apply other than those miss listed.
p2,00:16:07.380,00:16:08.060,spk_3,But
p2,00:16:08.530,00:16:09.870,spk_1,every hearing the appeal
p2,00:16:10.440,00:16:20.270,spk_3,"is complete. I think it's an error of law, my lady. Yeah, yeah, is that the tribunal is completely hearing the court appeals"
p2,00:16:22.310,00:16:23.400,spk_1,evidence. It is a
p2,00:16:23.400,00:16:26.310,spk_3,"completely hearing and all evidence and cross examination,"
p2,00:16:28.340,00:16:31.570,spk_0,"right? So fresh exceptions could be brought in at that stage,"
p2,00:16:31.570,00:16:51.060,spk_3,"indeed, and indeed were in this case because the history is that Ofcom relied on the prevention of crime exception. Then, after the Information Commissioner found that that wasn't engaged, Ofcom didn't pursue that exception only pursued intellectual property. And then T Mobile pursued that exception."
p2,00:16:56.140,00:16:56.640,spk_0,"Yeah,"
p2,00:16:56.650,00:17:02.010,spk_3,you're saying yes. The points made that fresh exceptions can be brought in at the discretion of the tribunal.
p2,00:17:02.840,00:17:07.829,spk_1,"You're saying, basically, there are three stages. Identify each of your"
p2,00:17:09.280,00:17:10.160,spk_3,engage interests.
p2,00:17:10.160,00:17:21.150,spk_1,"We are engaged. Then identify the various factors relating to the public interest in disclosure, which may be both general and particular."
p2,00:17:21.640,00:17:22.170,spk_3,Yes.
p2,00:17:22.740,00:17:29.140,spk_1,"Ah, actually four stages. And then ask yourself whether those outweigh"
p2,00:17:29.150,00:17:31.510,spk_3,"individually, because if they do, that's the end"
p2,00:17:31.510,00:17:41.330,spk_1,"of it. And then stand back and look at the big picture of, say, because we've got more than one factor does that took the balance of its four stages. I think that's"
p2,00:17:41.330,00:17:45.980,spk_3,"right, my lady. And we submit that if my Learned friends analysis,"
p2,00:17:46.740,00:17:46.950,spk_1,he
p2,00:17:46.950,00:17:52.600,spk_3,has to persuade the court that there is no situation in which Stage four could produce a different result from stage three.
p2,00:17:52.610,00:18:06.280,spk_0,"You may not reach stage four because you've already got there. Absolutely, yes, but it's in the example where you haven't reached that may be quite close to the margin. You say you can't you can't forever. That may not be an overlap."
p2,00:18:06.290,00:18:41.460,spk_3,"That's right. You can't you can't say there's no situation in which the fact in which there is a separate adverse effect on the public interest won't alter the balance. And if my learning friend either has to say that can never be the case or if he accepts that it can be the case, he has to put forward to this court the proposition that it was the intention of the legislator that there should be an obligation to disclose information even when it is against the identified and defined public interest to do so. And we submit that cannot be the intention of the legislation,"
p2,00:18:43.540,00:19:36.770,spk_6,"the public interest in disclosure in any particular case. It is a constant, isn't it? You work out what it is. It may be the basic general public interest in the disclosure of environmental information, or it may be that, plus particular aspects that make it particularly important in the given given. But once you've got there, you've got a constant against which, as I understand your case, you've got to measure the public interest going the other way. And if I understand your case, in order to measure the public interest underway, you must look at all the aspects of that public interest because otherwise you are not comparing like with like or turn it the other way around, as I was suggesting before lunch that if you do them"
p2,00:19:36.770,00:19:37.700,spk_1,separately
p2,00:19:38.180,00:20:24.800,spk_6,"and I can see why you do them separately, You will be double counting your constant if you separate them out. But you've only got one constant, and it's illogical to double count it for the purpose of saying, Well, in case one the exception it 95% or nearly as good as the public interest in disclosure. So the exception two again is nearly 85% but looked at individually, neither of them comes up to the value of the public interest in disclosure. But together they overwhelm it."
p2,00:20:24.800,00:20:26.230,spk_3,
p2,00:20:26.230,00:20:27.300,spk_1,"Yes, my lord"
p2,00:20:27.310,00:20:57.940,spk_3,"and we submit that to take that approach would be radically different from the approach which is normally adopted in public law decision making, which is to look overall at the interests which are identified as being relevant and to weigh them against each other. And given the analogy of public interest immunity, can I just show your lordships quickly? One case on PII, which is the Wiley case."
p2,00:20:57.950,00:20:59.490,spk_2,Can I just ask you just one point?

p2,00:21:43.100,00:21:57.060,spk_6,"cannot be so because you've got to weigh, uh, the public interest in maintaining the exception. Surely there can't have been any point in putting an exception in which doesn't have any public interest."
p2,00:21:57.540,00:21:59.210,spk_3,"Yes, this is"
p2,00:22:01.830,00:22:11.160,spk_6,"not a public interest. The law of the land protects intellectual property rights, and the public has an interest in upholding the law."
p2,00:22:11.640,00:23:36.520,spk_3,"This is the slight oddity in the difference between the drafting of the regulations and the drafting of the director. I'm going to come to directive in a minute. But as your Lordships will recall, the directive talks about the interest served by refusal. It doesn't talk about the public interest. The public interest comes into the regulations, and that leaves one with the oddity between the positions that your Lordships have both just put to me that at first sight, some of these appear to be private interests, and yet the legislator must envisage that there's a public interest or they wouldn't be included on the list. And in my submission, the only way that the that circle can be squared is on the reasoning that Lord Saville has just put forward, which is that it is taken to be the intention of the Legislature that there is a public interest in maintaining intellectual property. And that makes sense when one considers, for example, Article one of the first protocol that people's intellectual property rights our rights to which they, of course, have a fundamental right under the convention and therefore deserve protection. Now one can go through the individual exceptions. Luckily, this is not an issue that we have to be concerned with now because we start from the assumption that there is a public interest in maintaining these exceptions, or they couldn't be on the list if these were purely regarded as private interests."
p2,00:23:36.850,00:24:14.090,spk_0,"Good example. At Page 9 90 I'm sorry to keep going back to your letter, but it's very revealing. Because in dealing with C, which at first sight seems to be private interests, intellectual intellectual property rights, you make the point that, actually looking at the reasons it is in the public interest not to disclose the data set, that would mean that mobile operators would be unlikely to provide the information. So, I mean, there's a public interest in them being prepared to provide you with information. They do so in the knowledge that there is a system which enables their interest to be protected and you want to preserve that system. And that's a public interest element in it."
p2,00:24:14.530,00:24:27.530,spk_3,"And one can see the same point if you take, for example, the interests of people at F who provide information voluntarily. Yes, one can see how that same point would apply with considerable force in that situation."
p2,00:24:27.530,00:24:43.940,spk_0,"So there you have a definite public element public interest element, and you're weighing that up against the general public rule of rule of public disclosure. And you're saying, Well, actually, in this case, it's rather important, given the precision that's being looked for to maintain the exception."
p2,00:24:45.240,00:24:45.320,spk_3,"I mean that's where your reasoning goes,"

p2,00:25:40.700,00:25:46.710,spk_3,is simply to deal with the submission that was made by the appellant
p2,00:25:46.710,00:25:48.290,spk_1,
p2,00:25:48.300,00:26:21.270,spk_3,"that each of the exceptions is to be treated as if it were a separate public interest to be weighed against the public interest in disclosure. We submit that is conceptually incorrect. I'm going to come back to the regulations in a moment, and the court will see that the public interest is always seen as a single indivisible notion. And of course, we've seen already that regulation 12 6 that it is distinguished in that way from the particular interests referred to in regulation 12 5. But if we go to wildly at page 298, just below the letter D. Lord Wolf, all of the other members agreed with Lord Wolves reasoning. He's talking here about a waiver of the privilege that the public interest privilege cannot be waived. He was referring to the situation after being determined that the public interest against disclosure outweighed that of disclosure in the interests of the administration of justice. When that is the determination which has been made, it's inevitable that the preservation of the document should follow so as to protect what have been held to be the dominant public interest. It is, however, unhelpful to talk of waiver in the different situations where the balancing of the conflicting public interest has not yet been carried out or where it's been carried out, and the result requires disclosure. Although it is the practise to talk of conflicting public interests, this can be misleading. The conflict is more"

p2,00:27:17.890,00:28:12.560,spk_3,"as being between two different aspects of the public interest. If it is decided that the aspect of the public interest, which reflects the requirements of the administration of justice, outweighs the aspect of the interest which is against disclosure than it is that it is the public interest which requires disclosure. And we would submit that that basic principle applies also when one is considering what is meant by the public interests under these regulations that we don't have lots of little different separate public interests as an overall public interest, which has got to be assessed by weighing competing aspects of it. Can I just come to to further provisions in the regulations themselves, which we submit support our approach? We go back to the regulations in Tab one of authorities bundle one."
p2,00:28:13.140,00:28:13.460,spk_1,"Okay,"
p2,00:28:13.920,00:28:16.230,spk_3,I'd like to come to Regulation
p2,00:28:16.230,00:28:19.580,spk_2,15. This
p2,00:28:19.580,00:29:34.640,spk_3,"is dealing with a situation where you have a P I certificate in the context of environmental information. So Regulation 15 1 a minister of the crown may certify that a refusal to disclose information under Regulation 12 1 is because the disclosure A would adversely affect national security and be would not be in the public interest under Regulation 12 1 B and were then told that that certificate is determinative. But what I draw the court's attention to is the wording of 15 1 B that the question for the minister is whether disclosure would not be in the public interest under regulation 12 1 B And in my submission, that's a powerful indication that the exercise of considering whether the maintenance the public interest in maintaining the exceptions outweighs the public interest in disclosure is regarded as the same as the question whether disclosure would be in the public interest. There's no difference, and we see the same."
p2,00:29:34.650,00:29:40.630,spk_5,"I don't understand the point. Yes, this relates exclusive. It's national security. It"
p2,00:29:40.630,00:29:44.050,spk_3,"refers back to 12 1 beam Lord, I"
p2,00:29:44.210,00:29:49.010,spk_5,"suppose you can you can you certify, um that it, um"
p2,00:29:50.140,00:29:52.030,spk_1,"yeah, it"
p2,00:29:52.030,00:30:13.180,spk_5,"would affect national security. Um, but yeah, and might not be in the public interest if matters were taken into account. Um, which related to matters other than public security. National security."
p2,00:30:13.190,00:30:28.280,spk_3,"This is dealing, particularly with a national security certificate. But the point that I make is that the wording at 15 1 b is referring back to the exercise that's done at 12. 1 B."
p2,00:30:28.290,00:30:29.050,spk_5,"Yes,"
p2,00:30:29.440,00:30:36.520,spk_3,and the question that's being asked is whether disclosure would not be in the public interest under regulation 12 1 b and
p2,00:30:36.520,00:30:40.150,spk_4,"I, because maintaining the exception."
p2,00:30:41.620,00:31:12.860,spk_3,But I'm going to show Your Lordship and leadership another example. But the point that the reason I make that point is that there is considerable stress made by the appellants on the wording in 12 1 b the public interest in maintaining the exception and the suggestion that that means something different from weighing the public interest against disclosure against the public interest in favour. Now I submit this is an indication that it doesn't mean something different. We get a stronger indication if we look at Regulation 17
p2,00:31:13.640,00:31:13.910,spk_1,now.
p2,00:31:13.910,00:33:50.850,spk_3,"Regulation 17 deals with historical and transferred public records, transferred public records. This is a phrase that actually comes from the Freedom of Information Act. If the court goes to regulation to, you'll see that they are defined by reference to Section 15 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. And that section simply says that their records that have been transferred either to the Public Record Office or the Lord Chancellor or the Northern Irish Public Record Office. If we look at 17 1, where a request relates to information contained in a historical record, other than one to which Paragraph two applies and the public authority considers that it may be in the public interest to refuse to disclose that information under regulation 12 1 b, the public authority shall consult various people before it decides whether the information may or may not be disclosed. And I submit that. That's another indication that the regulations here are envisaging that the exercise that is to be done under 12 1 B is an evaluation of whether disclosure is or is not in the public interest. And we see the same thing again in my submission. When we look at Regulation 17, 2 and 17, 3, 17, 2 is transferred public records and what we're told here is the appropriate records authority shall consult the responsible authority on whether there may be an exception to disclosure of that information under Regulation 12 5 if the appropriate records authority decides that such an exception applies subject to paragraph for a determination on whether it may be in the public interest to refuse to disclose that information under regulation 12 1 B shall be made by the responsible authority. So again, in my submission, what one sees in regulations 15, 17 1 and 17 3 by explicit reference to regulation 12 1 b in each case is that what these regulations envisage the exercise under 12 1 p is being is a determination whether disclosure is not in the public interest. And we submit that supports our submission, that you have to evaluate the whole of the public interest on both sides and then decide which is predominant."
p2,00:33:50.860,00:34:00.900,spk_0,"But I think you said earlier, and I'm quite sure you maintain this, that in looking at that question, you're confined within the list. Of course, in 12."
p2,00:34:00.910,00:34:41.830,spk_3,"Yes, and the reason for that is the reason for that. As I've said before, we absolutely accept that this is a narrow and restrictive regime. Yes, where the presumption is in favour of disclosure and that one of its features is that there is an exhaustive list of potentially relevant public interests against disclosure. And that's that's the key safeguard that we submit maintains the policy of safeguarding the right of access to environmental information. You can't say there's another public interest is not mentioned in the list, and we're relying on that against disclosure. And that we submit is the significance of the wording at 12 1 be public interest in maintaining the exception."
p2,00:34:42.659,00:34:42.720,spk_5,The
p2,00:34:42.879,00:34:44.889,spk_3,significance of that phrase
p2,00:34:44.929,00:35:16.730,spk_5,"isn't 3 17 3 rather difficult to reconcile with your submission because it postulates a two stage process, the appropriate records. The authority must first decide whether an exception applies. And then, if it does the public interest, a decision is made by the responsible authority. Now there's no provision for what you say can happen, which is that none of the exceptions applies, but nonetheless the public interest and makes them all apply"
p2,00:35:16.740,00:35:29.960,spk_3,no more with respect. My submission only comes into effect where one where more than one of the exceptions applies. This is the distinction I was drawing before between an exception applying
p2,00:35:30.340,00:35:30.800,spk_5,yes
p2,00:35:31.040,00:35:38.360,spk_3,"and the public interest outweighing the public interest in disclosure. Because in order for the exception to apply, it has to be determined that there is an adverse"
p2,00:35:38.360,00:35:39.850,spk_2,effect on one
p2,00:35:39.850,00:35:45.070,spk_3,of the engaged in one of the specified interest. Then the exception appliance. Then you do the way
p2,00:35:45.080,00:35:46.410,spk_0,so they're all in play
p2,00:35:47.740,00:35:49.420,spk_3,play if they're found to apply.
p2,00:35:49.430,00:35:54.980,spk_0,"Well, of course, but they're all in play. If you say that they would adversely affect"
p2,00:35:55.050,00:36:02.970,spk_3,only if they apply. So the threshold question is. Is there an adverse effect that means the exception or exceptions? That's my singular

p2,00:36:03.590,00:36:25.470,spk_3,"Apply and then you weigh the public interest as a whole. So we submit that Regulation 17 3 strongly supports. I was our submission because it envisages a single exercise, a single decision, an overall weighing of the public interest against disclosure subject to the defined list."
p2,00:36:26.730,00:36:26.960,spk_5,Mhm.
p2,00:36:29.730,00:36:45.950,spk_3,"Now the appellant's seeks to rely on Regulation 13 3, which they say support them. Yeah, this is an exception dealing with personal data, which is, of course, principally dealt with the Data Protection Act."
p2,00:36:46.940,00:36:48.010,spk_0,"Sorry, where are we going to"
p2,00:36:48.110,00:36:49.530,spk_3,regulation 13?
p2,00:36:49.530,00:36:49.960,spk_2,Motive.
p2,00:36:54.250,00:38:18.040,spk_3,"And they rely in particular Regulation 13 3, where it said that by virtue of any provision apart for the Data Protection Act, the information is exempt from sections of one about that and in all the circumstances of the case, the public interest in not disclosing the information outweighs the public interest in disclosing it, And the appellants have argued in their printed case that that wording the public interest in not disclosing the information outweighed the public interest in disclosing it is to be contrasted, they say, with the wording of regulation 12 1 B, and they say it supports their argument. There should be no aggregation. Now. We say that completely misses the point. The point is that under the Data Protection Act provisions, there is not the same restricted list of permissible public interest factors that there is under this regime. So there is a general question of balancing the public interest against the public interest in favour. This regime only permits one or more of the specified exceptions to be relied upon. But we know that there is no intention to have a fundamentally different approach to 12 1 B from that which is here at 13 3, because the wording at 17 3 and 17 1 and 15 1 B is strikingly"
p2,00:38:18.040,00:38:19.210,spk_1,similar to
p2,00:38:19.210,00:38:20.540,spk_3,"the wording of 13 3,"
p2,00:38:20.920,00:38:22.400,spk_1,with
p2,00:38:22.400,00:40:05.030,spk_3,"explicit reference to 12 1 B. So what is different about 12 B is that you can only take into account one of the listed factors. But what is not different is that you consider all engaged factors, all exceptions that apply together. Can I now come to the directive because in my submission, the construction that we've applied to the regulations it accords with the natural meaning of the regulations and also with the policy of your lordships, have my submission about the undesirable consequences if I'm wrong and we submit that there is nothing in the directive that requires a contrary result indeed, our submission to the extent that the directive sheds light on this question, which is somewhat limited, it favours our construction. So if we now turn to the directive which is in Tab five, Okay, my Learned friend showed court the provision and the recitals that stress the importance of the right of access to environmental information. We certainly don't seek to dissent from any of that. We do make the point, however, that it is not an absolute right self. Evidently not because there are exceptions and also sees that Article one, that the objectives of the directive to guarantee the right of access to environmental information held by public authorities and to set up the basic terms and conditions of its exercise"
p2,00:40:06.210,00:40:06.530,spk_0,"Mhm,"
p2,00:40:08.510,00:40:40.830,spk_3,"mhm millennial friend relied on Recital 16, which is to be read together with article 42 of the directive. And in my submission there is nothing in either of those provisions that tells against my construction. Indeed, my submission is going to be that four to in fact, strongly supports my construction. We look at four to first because that's the dominant provisions, and my submission is going to be that Recital 16 really echoes it."
p2,00:40:41.410,00:40:41.900,spk_1,So
p2,00:40:41.900,00:42:20.880,spk_3,"an Article four, we have the exceptions set out at 4142, and my Learned friend makes an argument both in relation to the directive and in relation to regulations, which mirrors mirror the directive. In this respect, he says that the exceptions at 41 or regulation 12 4 are qualitatively different from the exceptions at 4 to 12 5, and that that shows you can't aggregate. There are two answers to that one is the answer that my Lord Lord Mance gave, which is that if you can't aggregate between 41 and four to, it doesn't follow that you can't aggregate between the paragraphs of four to second point, we submitted it. In any event, there is nothing about the nature of these exceptions, which would make it unfeasible or impractical to aggregate in any event. Now, it's true that there is something slightly odd about the notion we look at article for one b that a request is manifestly unreasonable. And yet still, the public interest favours disclosure. And that, in my submission is what's slightly odd about this territory scheme has nothing to do with aggregation. It's the idea that you still do the public interest balancing exercise when you're faced with a manifestly unreasonable request. Now that shows how strong the writers of access to environmental information. It has nothing to do with the question of aggregation or not aggregation. And we give an example in our printed case of a situation where you might have exceptions engaged under four"
p2,00:42:20.890,00:42:22.110,spk_2,one and
p2,00:42:22.120,00:43:22.790,spk_3,"under 42. For example, the person who asks for disclosure of all the commercially confidential information about mobile phone masts that's ever been submitted by any of the mobile operators to Ofcom ever since often came into existence. And you could say, Well, that's a manifestly unreasonable request, and it interferes with a number of the Article 42 rights, including intellectual property, confidentiality and so on. And in our submission, there is nothing in principle that would stop you, considering those different aspects of the public interest together and weighing them against the public interest in disclosure Now it may be that there won't be many cases where you have to do that, because it may be that if you start from the proposition that you've concluded that a request is manifestly unreasonable, it's not going to be very difficult for you to conclude just looking at that, that the public interest does not favour disclosure. Am I right"
p2,00:43:22.790,00:43:27.230,spk_1,in thinking? So? I'm just worrying about this.
p2,00:43:27.240,00:43:28.310,spk_3,Yes. Uh huh.
p2,00:43:30.000,00:43:38.910,spk_1,"The article 41 Yes, does not, except in 41 e require any balancing act."
p2,00:43:39.700,00:43:49.720,spk_3,"Well, my lady, it does. It does require balancing act in relation to all of the paragraphs. Because if you go to 42, the crucial repairs to"
p2,00:43:49.720,00:43:50.300,spk_2,both paragraphs

p2,00:43:52.520,00:43:56.360,spk_4,quite possible. This was an error because
p2,00:43:56.370,00:43:57.020,spk_3,it's not in the

p2,00:44:04.870,00:44:11.240,spk_3,life. But this is always the subtext of the directive. Will you sit here anxiously?
p2,00:44:11.790,00:44:12.130,spk_2,It's a bit
p2,00:44:12.130,00:44:30.460,spk_3,"like biblical exegesis. It's all got to be perfect and the best of all possible worlds and your logic may be right, but of course. What's odd about for one, there's nothing to do with the aggregation. It's the oddity that you balance at all. So we submit. It takes its neutral on the question that"
p2,00:44:30.470,00:44:34.400,spk_1,it expressly referred to E but not in any
p2,00:44:34.400,00:45:35.920,spk_3,"of the other. Absolutely. And we look at are in a moment, and it is It is an oddity, but the crucial passage. So we submit that that takes another friend nowhere, uh, either for the directive or where he makes the same point in relation to the regulations. But then we come to the passage on which he most strongly relies. We submit this passage actually supports us. The grounds for refusal mentioned in paragraphs one and two, shall be interpreted in a restrictive way, taking into account for the particular case the public interest served by disclosure. Now that makes it clear that you have to assess the public interest in favour of disclosing the information on the facts of the individual particular case. Then, in every particular case, the public interest served by disclosure shall be weighed against the interests served by the refusal. Now we draw attention. Two the distinction in this paragraph between the grounds for refusal"
p2,00:45:36.590,00:45:36.810,spk_1,that
p2,00:45:36.810,00:45:41.890,spk_3,are referred to at the beginning of the paragraph and the interests served by the refusal.
p2,00:45:42.790,00:45:43.430,spk_1,We
p2,00:45:43.430,00:47:11.290,spk_3,"submit that what you can see in this paragraph is it envisages a single request for information, a particular case. The particular case is a particular request for disclosure of information. Yeah, in that particular case, grounds for refusal may be relied upon, and those are the grounds that are listed in paragraphs one and two. Then you have to assess the public interest served by disclosure. And then you have to weigh that against the interests served by the refusal not by each individual ground for refusal, but by the refusal considered as a whole. And we submit that therefore, where the refusal is on the basis of more than one ground, you weigh those grounds together against the particular interests served by disclosure and on my L earned friend's case. What you would expect to see in this paragraph is not the phrase the interests served by the refusal, but the interests served by each particular ground of refusal relied upon. So that's the first point that we rely upon here where we say that in fact, the directive tells against men and friends construction"
p2,00:47:11.300,00:47:21.200,spk_0,"this whole sentences really a guide to interpretation of the grounds for refusal, isn't it? I mean, you look at the beginning of the sentence. That's what you're doing here."
p2,00:47:21.210,00:47:22.720,spk_3,They must be interrupted. Yes.
p2,00:47:22.730,00:47:26.830,spk_0,"And you do have to take them one by one. I suppose, to carry out the exercise."
p2,00:47:26.830,00:48:19.460,spk_3,"Yes, but then you weigh the interests served by the refusal, not the interests served by each ground where the interests of by the refusal, the key point that's being made here is that there shall be no class claims. My submission. That's what this is really getting at. That's the key point saying you cannot have a situation where a state says we will not disclose any information that adversely affects intellectual property rights. Blanket ban. It's making it very clear that you've got to conduct the weighing exercise on the ground On the particular facts of an individual case, the individual grounds are to be restrictive. It's true, there's always got to be a weighing. But then, in my submission, it's a new way the interests served by the refusal as a whole against the public interest served by"
p2,00:48:19.460,00:48:48.610,spk_4,"disclosure. Mr Lewis was right in saying that one doesn't normally get much help from the Traver. But to the extent they are some help, they do help you because, uh, various stages in the formulation of the directive, there were phrases such as public interest served by disclosure outweighs and interest protected by an exception or the specific interests protected by non disclosure. And those didn't find their way into the final. Yes,"
p2,00:48:48.620,00:49:02.000,spk_3,"we had looked at the travel, and we had come to the conclusion that they weren't sufficiently clear either way to be a much assistance. But I do take your lordships point."
p2,00:49:04.470,00:49:12.000,spk_1,You didn't want to draw attention to how unclear they were fancied making a reference.
p2,00:49:12.010,00:49:55.770,spk_3,"Well, my lady, ultimately one is looking at the legislation, and the court will make its own nuclear. But in my submission, there isn't really any lack of clarity here when one understands just how unusual the approach that the appellants are seeking to put forward actually is, and how different it is from the approach adopted in almost any other context, where you have a right exercisable subject to qualification or condition, I cannot think of another context in which you would apply this approach to the weighing of competing considerations for determining whether a right should or should not be interfered with."
p2,00:49:55.780,00:50:08.020,spk_1,"Yes. And that may be why the Court of Appeal agreed with you. Well, Malaysia have more used to all the other contexts. Specialist Tribunal doesn't agree with you because it's more used to this context,"

Now the information tribunal is, of course, expert in dealing with requests for freedom information, but with great respect to them, not necessarily so. Expert in the interpretation of European law. Public law principles question"
p2,00:50:33.210,00:50:49.730,spk_1,"what they're putting it all into practise. You see, they're looking at it. How do we actually do this intellectual exercise? Are you asking us to do an intellectual exercise, which, in the reality of the cases that we have, is meaningful? That's what they're asking themselves. I don't know what the answer is, but that's what they're definitely asking themselves."
p2,00:50:49.940,00:52:07.770,spk_3,"How is that respect that exercise significantly different from the exercise that a court has to apply when considering the claim for public interest immunity. Of course, the context is different. Of course, the context is different. But the exercise in my submission is not fundamentally different because you're considering the same question. Balancing the public interest factors in favour of disclosure against disclosure. Yes, you have a broader discretion as to what public interest factors can be taken into account against disclosure. My submission would never be suggested that when conducting that balancing exercise, the court was required to take each public interest factor relied on by the state and balance it separately against the public interest in disclosure. And we submit that if such a strange approach which precluded an overall balancing exercise, was to be mandated by this legislation, you would expect to see some indication in the text. So that was what was required because it departs so radically from the normal methods of decision making. But one doesn't see it. I'm going to turn to the Bovis case in a moment. But, lady, you know, in my submission, one can perhaps place a little bit too much weight on the irritation of the tribunal of being overruled and, you know"

p2,00:56:28.930,00:56:35.410,spk_3,I was drawing attention to features in the directive that we say supports our interpretation and dealt

Right to information means that the disclosure of information should be the general rule and that public authorities should be permitted to refuse a request for environmental information in specific and clearly defined cases. Grounds for refusal should be interpreted in a restrictive way. So specific and clearly defined cases is clearly a reference to the exhaustive list. Grounds for refusal should be interpreted in a restrictive way. That's the passage forward we've just been looking at, whereby the public interest served by disclosure should be weighed against the interests served by the refusal. The same formula that we have in four to the reasons"

And that strongly suggests that there was no intention under the directive. Or we would submit, under the regulations that their inclusion in a single or separate paragraphs should affect the way that they were weighed against the public interest in favour of disclosure."

p2,01:00:36.180,01:00:38.240,spk_0,I didn't quite grasp that answer.

p2,01:00:39.290,01:00:40.610,spk_0,just go over that point again.

And I said no. I didn't think it could mean that, because if it did mean that, it would mean that all the legislative instruments were using the wrong word and that we must take it at its face value,"
p2,01:01:01.540,01:01:32.560,spk_5,"doesn't it? Perhaps both. After all it goes on, say, taking into account for the particular case, the public interest served by disclosure. That's an application point. And I was just looking at Sweden and Turco, which has some resonance for this case, and I see that they say, in view of the objectives pursued by regulation. In that case, 149, 2000 and one, those exceptions must be interpreted and applied strictly. See another well known case, Sweden and commission. I mean,"
p2,01:01:32.570,01:01:33.390,spk_3,we would be
p2,01:01:33.660,01:01:35.860,spk_5,interpreted and supply and applied.
p2,01:01:35.870,01:01:43.650,spk_3,We would certainly accept that That's the right approach certain. But that again doesn't address the point in this case.
p2,01:01:46.510,01:02:12.610,spk_5,"Mhm what it might do in the sense that the basic European approach to exceptions is perhaps slightly more aggressive than our domestic approach. In the sense that yeah, we tend to say, Well, exception must mean something and you give it its normal meeting. The general European approaches to be pretty tight about the interpretation of any exception."
p2,01:02:13.400,01:02:56.430,spk_3,"I accept that I accept that's particularly inappropriate and appropriate approach in the context of this legislative scheme. But what I also submit is that it simply doesn't follow from that. That where you have found as a fact that more than one exception applies interpreting the exception strictly that there is a real adverse effect and that the exception supply that when you found that that you can't then consider together and balance the public interest on both sides. And indeed, in my submission, what one gets from the legislative scheme is emphasis repeatedly on the need to consider the particular facts of the individual case the interests that are actually engaged and the need to balance the competing interests."
p2,01:02:56.800,01:02:58.740,spk_1,So this is your point about class claims?
p2,01:02:58.750,01:03:00.600,spk_3,"Yes, we repeated"
p2,01:03:00.600,01:03:12.200,spk_1,"reference to the particular case. It's not enough to say just because this is about a particular sort of information, we're going to put a stamp Restrictive"

p2,01:03:57.130,01:04:08.920,spk_3,"Yeah. And essentially, the question that they are raising the question that was raised this morning. If one engaged exception doesn't that way,"
p2,01:04:09.290,01:04:09.690,spk_2,the public
p2,01:04:09.690,01:04:17.240,spk_3,interest how do two or more considered together outweigh the public interest? And the court has my submissions on that
p2,01:04:17.240,01:04:18.280,spk_1,point
p2,01:04:18.290,01:05:12.460,spk_3,"that the answer is simply that they can, Because if different aspects of the public interests are adversely affected by disclosure, particular piece of information those different aspects considered together may outweigh the constant, which is the public interest in favour of disclosure. There's some oddities in this paragraph. With respect it's not. Perhaps it might be, They say, that the statutory question directs us in figurative language to make a judgement on relative importance. But what with respect they are not looking at is the fact that if different aspects of the public interest are negatively impacted by the disclosure document, that in itself is something needs to be taken into account. They say it's not a mechanical or mathematical exercise, and I would agree, and then they make the point that we've already discussed off some more."
p2,01:05:12.820,01:05:33.550,spk_6,Would you say that the the suggested difficulties in looking at the various aspects of the public interest not disclosing is no more different or difficult than looking at the various aspects together of disclosing
p2,01:05:33.560,01:05:36.560,spk_3,"Yes, my lord, and with respect to doing"
p2,01:05:36.560,01:05:38.890,spk_6,"the same exercises, the same exercise on"
p2,01:05:38.890,01:05:56.450,spk_3,"both sides of the equation, along with respect to the tribunal. Uh huh. I'm slightly surprised they find it so difficult because this is the normal exercise conducted by all courts. When trying to deal with this kind of judgement so odd that this particular tribunal is finding it so difficult to deal with."
p2,01:05:56.460,01:06:42.940,spk_0,"I wonder whether they're making life difficult for themselves in the first sentence. The sentence it looks, there or so they are concluding that a particular exception is outweighed. Negative almost doesn't apply. That's going too far on your argument. I think you can get it one way. Yes, if it if it applies and is not out, it's not. It's not overridden by the public interest, and you've got a ground for withholding the information for refusal. And that's good enough. But the case you're dealing with is one way you don't reach that position. It's engaged but not not fully satisfied. And it's that particular situation that has raised, and I have a feeling that they haven't appreciated that particular point."
p2,01:06:42.950,01:06:44.380,spk_3,It may be said. Maybe so.
p2,01:06:44.550,01:06:52.500,spk_5,I thought you were saying that the first stage was that you considered the public interest in relation to each exception separately.
p2,01:06:53.380,01:07:07.220,spk_3,"Well, the way the Court of Appeal put it is that it would often be convenient to do so. And one can see why. Because if you conclude that once considered alone outweighs the public interest in disclosure, that's the end of the case. There's"
p2,01:07:07.220,01:07:08.080,spk_0,no point in going on.
p2,01:07:08.090,01:07:08.850,spk_3,There's no need to go

Interest in disclosure doesn't necessarily follow that. If you consider both public interest factors together, they won't outweigh the interest in favour and with respect to I don't see any particular difficulty in conducting that exercise."

p2,01:08:04.990,01:08:05.860,spk_0,isn't right.

And this should include one, the public interest in respecting the commercial interests of intellectual property rights owners, two the risk to public safety. So that's the other exception that was engaged, and three disadvantages if the M and O's decide they should permanently withdraw their cooperation. So those are the only three aspect of the public interest I was suggesting should be considered. I wasn't suggesting that any other aspects of the public interest that didn't fall within the scope of the exceptions in Regulation 12 5 should be brought into play at all. And their conclusion was that they would take into account aspects one and three, but they would not take into account aspect to"

p2,01:09:10.509,01:09:41.049,spk_3,even though they had already found that was engaged. And what we with respect say is erroneous in this analysis is their claim at paragraph 58 that my submission would produce a strange result. We submit its the alternative approach that produces the strange result because it necessarily envisages a situation where the public interest is against disclosure. But you're bound to disclose. But
p2,01:09:41.060,01:09:57.400,spk_0,"the last four or five lines, you would say, is really raising an issue, which you weren't raising at all, which is something that might generally be said to justify withholding regardless of content."

Of course, it's the other side of the coin that they had found that the public interest in withholding information might be of value to criminals does not justify maintaining public safety exception. And then they're objecting to my point that you could look at intellectual property rights. But of course, that's only on the basis that the intellectual property rights exception is also engaged. It's the same point the other way around, and what we say is the oddity of a situation in which it's acknowledged by a tribunal, that the public interest is adversely affected in the sense that disclosing this information will have an adverse effect on public safety. But, they then ignore that factor when seeking to decide whether or not the material is to be disclosed. Mhm."
p2,01:11:03.990,01:11:20.980,spk_5,Has there ever been a a European case apart from Sweden and Turco on the application of exceptions under a disclosure regime in European law?
p2,01:11:21.960,01:11:23.330,spk_3,Not to my knowledge
p2,01:11:23.340,01:13:17.840,spk_5,"Again, I don't know whether you look at Sweden and Turco, but if you look at paragraphs 36 to 45 they're dealing with the exception of legal advice under the provisions for disclosure. And the provision for disclosure in the regulation has in it, like the present provisions a number of heads starting off with commercial interests of a natural or legal person, intellectual property rights, legal advice, court proceedings, purpose of inspections, investigations and audits. So there are number. Unless there's an overriding public interest in disclosure. And what they say is that when you look at the legal advice and, exception, you have to conduct a three stage analysis. You must specify yourself, the document relates legal advice. Um, you must examine whether disclosure of parts of the document in question would undermine the protection of that advice. Um, you must then, third and last, If you take the view, that disclosure document would undermine the protection of the legal advice. It's incumbent on the council because that was talking about the council ministers to ascertain whether there's any overriding public interest justifying disclosure in this respect. It's for the council to balance the particular interest to be protected by non disclosure of the document concerned against inter alia the public interest in the document being made accessible in the light of the advantages stemming as noted in the recitals for increased openness, etcetera, etcetera. So that's a pure exception related three stage criteria is preceded by the words that I read before those exceptions would be interpreted and applied strictly. See Sweden condition, which spells that out and in great length, with a reference to a whole host of authorities. And and there's no hint that you require to step back. And, of course, in context, it didn't arise. But"

If you were in a situation where only were request only engaged. One exception. Absolutely. And indeed, My Learned friends have cited a number of information tribunal decisions which deal with that situation and that, say the public interest that you've got to balance is the public interest that's relevant to the engaged exception.

p2,01:15:14.600,01:15:15.170,spk_3,matters?
p2,01:15:15.640,01:15:28.980,spk_2,"In our submission, the basic position is there is a right to information and a duty to provide environmental information. A public authority is exempt from the duty to provide the information"

p2,01:15:30.170,01:16:25.360,spk_2,"One of a limited number of exceptions applies, and the interest in maintaining that exception outweighs the public interest in disclosure and in our submission as law. The legislation in particular interest exception sir, and it requires such interest specifically justified in a context where the presumption of disclosure paragraph 40 on page 40 the appendix. The alternative approach is not to focus on a regime where you have a right to access subject to limited, defined exceptions, but instead to talk about assessing the overall public interest or the aggregate public interest. Sometimes said to be looking at matters in the round, sometimes said to be looking at a situation where the two exceptions don't themselves justify nondisclosure, but you stand back in another metaphorical exercise and look at it"
p2,01:16:25.940,01:16:27.760,spk_1,broadly. I hear it all the
p2,01:16:27.760,01:16:29.330,spk_0,"time,"
p2,01:16:29.930,01:20:20.310,spk_2,"My lady. I'm encouraging you not to be broad. I'm encouraging you to be narrow, okay? Because the direction and the regulations do not proceed on the basis that there is some kind of abstract overall public interest which is separate from, different in content from, and greater than the specified exceptions that you are dealing with in our submission. If you look at the directive and then you look at how the regulations proceed, they approach it on the basis of a focus on the individual exception. Does it apply? Does the exception outweigh the public interest in disclosure? It does not approach it on the basis of a generalised abstract English type Wiley, It's all part of the public interest. You start really with the recital at 16. The general rule is disclosure, and a public authority should only be permitted to refuse in a specific and clearly defined case. That is the starting point. Regulation 16. You then see the way in which that is translated into the directive and it is done by a way of two provisions. Article 41 and 42, which set out sets of exceptions. There is no common underlying theme in the exceptions in 4 and 5 and no common underlying theme in the exception. Fine, it is clear response to my Lord, Lord Collins question that interpret does mean interpret and apply, because you see that from Recital 16. It said Grant for refusal should be interpreted in a restrictive way whereby the public interest served by disclosure should be weighed against the interests served by the refusal. It is clearly both that they are talking about because they are approaching it from the viewpoint of you can only avoid the right of access in a clear and defined case, and that involves looking at the exception and when you're doing so in a way that is restrictive. Weighing the exception against the interest in disclosure and that is reflected in the language of Regulation 12 and 14, Regulation 12 is not the public interest. Regulation 12 is the public interest in maintaining the exception. That is what the regulation says, and you weigh that against the public interest in disclosure. Regulation 14 says. You specify any exception, relied upon again a focus on individual exceptions. You don't specify one, and then maybe you're tossing a few others. Should it go to the information Tribunal, the focuses on identifying the exceptions upon which your ally and then obviously you have to weigh that against the, uh, public interest in disclosure regulations. 15, 1 and 17. Do not assist the respondent. If anything, assist the appellant. If I could ask you to look at 15 1, it is replete with the approach that we suggest is adopted. Does an exception apply? Does it outweigh the interest in disclosure? 15 18 Nationalists would adversely affect national security that is, in effect, five aid you can refuse to disclose as a public authority if disclosure would adversely affect national security. B is in fact, not the public interest. Full stop. It is the public interest and regulation 12 1. What is that? It is the public interest in maintaining the exception that is the exception of national security in Regulation 12 5. Be"

I don't think that actually grammatically incorrect, but the point is, it doesn't assist my friend to say that this shows there's an overall public interest, because what it shows is there is the question of applicability of an exception. Would it adversely affect national security? And then there's the question. Would it be in the public interest under regulation 12 1 B? That's shorthand for the public interest in maintaining the exception. It's the same with Regulation 17. If you look at 17 3 and 38, it is exactly what we say the directive focuses on."
p2,01:21:32.910,01:21:34.020,spk_3,You see the
p2,01:21:34.020,01:23:59.270,spk_2,"specific exception if it applies, and does it outweigh disclosure? 17 3 If the appropriate record authority decides that such an exception applies, always the first question does an exception apply, and then subject to that, a determination on whether it may be in the public interest to refuse to disclose that information under regulation 12 1 B, because the public interest is maintaining the exception, not some kind of abstract entity that stalks the land untethered, My lord, in terms of that is the short answer to this case is that is that the whole of the European regime, as reflected in the regulations, does. As Lord Justice Law says at paragraph 48 again at paragraph 53. If Your Lordship and Leadership looks at Page 14, 41 48 to the focus of the legislation is on the particular interests, which the particular exception serve, it requires. Such interest, in effect, is specifically justified in a contest with the Presumptions in favour of disclosure. Miss Rose Refiners submissions there to say it's only be interested in regulation 12 50. In my judgement, this position remains to I've concluded that the scheme is that each exception carry its own justification. And then he goes on to regulation 12 be the contrast of 13 of the regs, which talks about the public interest in withholding the information rather than maintaining the exception and again at 53. The reason. I think the approach taken in that text book, which is the approach we adopt is correct, is essentially grounded in the policy balance that one finds in the directive and in the regulation. There is a general duty to disclose it is Mr Charging footed purpose blind. No justification has to be shown to the disclosure in the first incident. The exceptions are drawn tightly. The wording suggests at least that they must be considered exception by exception, and that includes the public interest that attaches to each exception. The scheme is a striking one, but it seems to me that the words both of the directive and of the environmental information regulations promote the result that is arrived at by the tribunal and then one final point, My Lord, about paragraph 12 58. Is it one exception, or is it four? We have always said, and it was common ground below. And if your law should go to Page 17 of Dependence part of 30"
p2,01:23:59.270,01:24:00.570,spk_3,"eight, there"

p2,01:24:21.610,01:25:21.610,spk_2,"you. That construction is reinforced by the number of nature of possible exceptions. For example, it is common ground that paragraph five A of Regulation 12 is to be read, not as a single exception. It is containing four separate exceptions. In fact, we say the nature of the exception points against aggregation paragraph four and paragraph five different in nature and quality within paragraph. There are different types of interest is my Lord, Lord Man's pointed out, Some are public interest. Some are private, Your Lordship. Recollect that the directive doesn't even use the word public interest in refusal. It talks about the interest. So it's not supposing some public interest in the abstract sense? Uh huh.
