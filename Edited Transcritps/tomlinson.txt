p1,00:00:31.320,00:00:31.890,spk_1,against
p1,00:00:31.900,00:00:33.360,spk_0,Birmingham City Council.
p1,00:00:34.240,00:00:35.800,spk_2,"Okay. Yes, Mr Goudie,"
p1,00:00:37.340,00:01:43.400,spk_1,"Ultimately, this is in the field for all of entitlements. Which I appear with my learned friend Mr Zia Nabi two unintentionally homeless families in priority need and are learning friends, Mr Andrew Arden, Queen's counsel, and Mr Christopher Baker now appear for the local housing authority the city of Birmingham. Our learned friend Natalie Lieven Queen's counsel appears for the Secretary of State as intervener. Lords and my Lady, I should inform the court at the outset by way of update that Mrs Ibrahim has left her temporary accommodation and has not recently been in touch with either my instructing solicitor or the Legal Services Commission. We therefore do not have instructions and we do not know her current whereabouts. She and her 6 children may very well still be homeless. The one can put it now higher than that. The Legal Services Commission for their purposes is content for the appeal to proceed on her behalf as well as on behalf of Mrs Ali. They having been appraised of the circumstances."
p1,00:01:43.410,00:01:46.260,spk_2,It is a live issue In Ms Ali's
p1,00:01:46.270,00:01:47.360,spk_1,case. You
p1,00:01:47.360,00:01:48.850,spk_2,have instructions in the case.
p1,00:01:48.860,00:02:57.890,spk_1,"Indeed. Thank you. Yes, My Lords and my Lady. The starting point in this appeal is 7 short uncontroversial propositions. First, the appellants had an entitlement to accommodation. Their circumstances were such that the Housing Act required the authority to secure accommodation for them. Uh, secondly, that entitlement under the Housing Act existed until either accommodation was secured or an event occurred upon which the duty would cease. Thirdly, an officer of the councillors ruled that the duty and the entitlement have come to an end. Fourthly, that withdrawal of entitlement was upheld, a fraction slower. I'm sorry. The officers ruled the entitlement-- the duty and the entitlement had come to an end. Fourthly, that withdrawal of entitlement was upheld on review by another officer of the same authority."
p1,00:02:57.900,00:03:00.300,spk_2,"A senior officer, a more senior officer,"
p1,00:03:00.330,00:03:10.160,spk_1,a more senior officer and with a different a different role. But an officer employed by the same housing authority in the same department.
p1,00:03:10.740,00:03:11.060,spk_0,That's right.
p1,00:03:14.240,00:04:03.760,spk_1,"And, fifthly, that second officer was not an independent and impartial tribunal not being independent at all. Sixthly, And in our submission of particular importance on these appeals, the decisions that both council officers made was one exclusively of primary fact whether a particular letter had or had not been received. So a decision not involving either specialist expertise or policy considerations and in those respects, wholly unlike a question that also arises under the same part of the same Housing Act, such as whether particular accommodation is suitable."
p1,00:04:06.240,00:05:53.100,spk_0,"But what about all the other factual issues that arise under part 7? This happens to be a particularly bizarre factual dispute about the arrival or non arrival of particular letters. Um, but there's a whole spectrum of decisions that have to be taken under part 7 that begin with that, which is a stark issue of did she, or did she not get to the letter? To Did she or did she not have accommodation available? What was accommodation? What was available? Did she or did she not leave it in circumstances where she could reasonably be expected to continue to stay there? Other other sorts of factual situations. Was she or was she not in fear of domestic violence? All of these sorts of things, there's a spectrum that starts with the very stark either or question goes through a lot of other questions that are basically factual questions. Not a lot of expertise required, but factual questions in those homelessness decision to the rather more evaluative question, which is this suitable accommodation? Um, and of course, their evaluations involved. Was this reasonable? Was it reasonable for her to continue to occupy, bearing in mind the housing conditions locally? All of those sorts of things all I'm getting at is that we've been presented with this stark, simple factual issue, and that's all you're focusing on for reasons forensically, I completely understand. But the problem before us really has to be a wider one than that, doesn't it?"
p1,00:05:53.110,00:07:43.050,spk_1,"Certainly my Lady. And indeed it's not merely forensic. It is fortuitous, because in the Court of Appeal there were three cases, the third being the case. That had been the lead case and that was mentioned when this case was called on this morning. Namely, Tomlinson. Tomlinson was not a case about whether or not the left had been received. It was a case about whether or not there was intentional homelessness or Mrs Tomlinson's behalf. So that is an illustration, as Baroness Hale has indicated, one of a number of factual issues that may arise. Another instance, and only an instance amongst a number is the question whether or not there is good cause for delay in, for example, asking for a review, which is essentially the same question as the question. Whether it was good cause for a late application for housing benefit, which was the very issue treated as an issue of fact that was dealt with by the Strasbourg court in the Tsfayo case. So there are a number of instances that are plainly on the factual side of the line. Um, one could enumerate them. I think that they would get towards double figures. There are cases, at any rate at the other end of the spectrum, which are plainly not factual issues, but evaluative issues such as whether accommodation is suitable, such as whether or not it's reasonable to leave or to refuse particular accommodation and so forth. And it may be that there are one or two questions where the categorisation would not be as straightforward and some of the cases these certainly are stark cases of primary fact on any"
p1,00:07:43.050,00:08:08.650,spk_2,"view. They're stark, partly because of the result of the review, which was against these two individuals, but it had gone the other way. Of course, it would have led into the the system, which would have opened up all the variety of questions that have been referred to. So one must be careful not to isolate it to sharply, I suggest, because it is all part of the system that's been laid down to in part seven to deal with the homelessness problem."
p1,00:08:09.240,00:08:29.060,spk_1,"Certainly my Lord. If the factual issue is resolved in a particular way, then that may lead into other questions which may be of value of nature and would be therefore, a matter that fell, so to speak, on Runa Begum, um, rather than the side of the line."
p1,00:08:29.370,00:08:40.260,spk_2,"At some point, no doubt you're going to tell us how this our system can live with a state of affairs where one has a whole variety of questions of different levels and have to be dealt with in different ways."
p1,00:08:40.680,00:12:09.660,spk_1,"My Lord. Certainly, I'm going to come to the question of a practical considerations, which weighed heavily with the Court of Appeal and indeed with the judges in the county court and my Lord the, but in our submission put shortly there is. It is a perfectly workable arrangement, if that is what is needed, that one has certain aspects decided in one way and others in another. My Lord, my sixth. That preliminary point was the well, it's the point that I've made that the about yes, the seventh is that although, and this indeed is the point. Lady Hale has already raised that, although both the Ali and Ibrahim cases involved the issue of whether a particular letter has been received. Of course, cases that turn only on the resolution of fact can arise in other ways. In the homelessness context of which Tomlinson is an example, and my Lords and my Lady, this leaves 2 areas of major controversy. There is a third area of controversy in relation to remedy, whether it must be a declaration of incompatibility or not. But on the substance of the matter. Two major issues first were the council's adverse credibility findings against both appellants and consequent abandonment of the councils housing duties towards the appellant determinations of civil rights of the appellant's for Article six purposes. That is therefore, the determination not only at rights which plainly they are but of civil rights. We submit that they were civil rights that matters, what the Housing Act conferred, and secondly, if so, does Article six require a full merits review. In our submission, It does, in a case which turns on a simple question of primary fact with no specialist expertise required to determine it and no element of policy or discretion involved in the determination. Well, this latter submission well, the former submission involves the determination of a case that was not determined as such in Runa Begum, but was the assumption upon which the house proceeded. The latter submission involves either distinguishing or overruling the decision of the House of Lords in the Runa Begum case on suitability of accommodation. My Lord, another way of putting that submission is that it gives effect to the decision of the Strasbourg court in Tsfayo, in the UK and now also, we would say to the very recent and important decision of the Strasbourg court in Crompton and the UK a decision more recent even than our printed case, my Lord before coming in a moment to the first issue that is determination of civil rights. I should perhaps say a word about the composite expression in Article 6, an independent and impartial tribunal. Yes,"
p1,00:12:09.660,00:12:45.460,spk_2,"I'd be grateful if you would, because I was uneasy about her passage in your written case, where you simply asserted that the reviewing officer was not only not independent, which everybody would agree with, but that it had been effectively declared in Runa Begum that he was could not be regarded as impartial. I think Lord Hoffman particularly chose his words some care. And I think it's right to say Lord Bingham did as well. And so there is an area for debate as to whether the impartiality part of it was really it really matters. Where was it? Failed that test too."
p1,00:12:46.340,00:14:26.260,spk_1,"My Lord. What I submit about that is this. First of all, uh, that the expression an independent and impartial tribunal in article six led the House of Lords in Porter v McGill to say that the convention test under Article 6, the independent and impartial tribunal and the domestic test for bias have become one and the same and the fact that they are now in harmony. And as your Lordship indeed observed in Porter v McGill, there is a close relationship between the concept of independence and that of impartiality. My Lord, in this case, it's common ground that the review officers were not independent. My Lord actual partiality is not alleged, my Lord. But in our submission, the very lack of independence creates the appearance or perception of partiality. Because the first instance decision maker and the reviewer are both employed by the same authority and the decisions they both make have resource implications for their employing authority. So my Lord, although I accept that, impartiality is something separate from independent in our submission, they are very closely related. And, of course, the lack of independence suffices. Whether or not there is impartial, a lack of part there is impartiality for the purposes of Article six being engaged."
p1,00:14:26.300,00:14:52.950,spk_2,"I think that's Lord Bingham and, Runa Begum in paragraph 9.9 paragraph. Paragraph 3 is really making that point. He isolated independent earlier, but in paragraph 9, sub paragraph 3, he said, The rules do not establish this person as an impartial and independent tribunal, taking it as a the package, so I think you can take that out of it."
p1,00:14:53.570,00:15:21.100,spk_1,"It's not obvious to me. I've never really have to think through it. Not obvious to me what case you could be said to be not independent. And at the same time Mm. However, that you are impartial. What does it mean? Except for an apparent lack of apparent want of impartiality, of what I thought, that's what"
p1,00:15:21.100,00:15:21.260,spk_2,it is
p1,00:15:21.940,00:15:22.870,spk_1,not being
p1,00:15:22.880,00:15:23.650,spk_0,"meant,"
p1,00:15:24.140,00:15:59.600,spk_1,"My Lord. It may be that the key word is the word your Lordship used apparent in that if somebody is actually not with independence with independence, we're not talking about appearance. Somebody is independent or they're not. So one is talking about an actual lack of independence that may be combined with there not being an actual evidence, lack of lack of impartiality, but will agree with respect inevitably be the appearance of a lack of impartiality when there is a lack of independence,"
p1,00:15:59.610,00:16:04.860,spk_0,"the question is, clearly you can be independent but not impartial."
p1,00:16:06.140,00:16:06.500,spk_1,"Yeah,"
p1,00:16:06.510,00:16:15.760,spk_0,"that's obvious, but the question is, can you be not independent and still be impartial?"
p1,00:16:16.740,00:16:18.090,spk_1,That is the question.
p1,00:16:18.100,00:16:19.230,spk_0,That's the only question
p1,00:16:19.240,00:16:20.610,spk_1,that is the only
p1,00:16:20.680,00:16:27.790,spk_0,"one. And there are some subtle things that can be said because they were said to us in the Croydon case about that question. Yes,"
p1,00:16:28.110,00:16:46.470,spk_1,"and in the Croydon case, as I understand it, the argument there was that the officers making the decisions under Section 20 of the Children's Act not only not independent, that we're not impartial, and it's difficult to see that position really is any different under the Housing Act struck so far at that point is concerned."
p1,00:16:47.540,00:16:47.770,spk_0,"My Lord,"
p1,00:16:49.040,00:21:08.340,spk_1,"The Housing Act is in Volume 1 of the authorities at tab 1. My Lord, what has been extracted into the extract is both part 6 allocation of housing, accommodation and part seven homelessness, my Lord so far as part 6 is concerned allocation. We're not on this appeal directly, if indeed at all. Concerned with part 6 but Your Lordship's and my Lady we have seen from the printed cases, the respondents do seek to derive something from part 6, so one should perhaps look briefly at its general structure. Um, the introductory section, Section 159 requires a local housing authority to comply with the provisions of part 6 in allocating housing accommodation and for the purposes of part 6. They allocate housing accommodation in any of the circumstances set out in subsection two and then one seized by subsection 7. That broadly, a local housing authority may allocate housing accommodation in such manner as they consider appropriate that subject to the provisions of the party, we need to look at Section 160 cases where provisions about allocations do not apply, then paid four of the extract the section 160A allocation only to eligible persons, and I can go on. I think the page 8 and 2 sections 166 relating to applications for housing accommodation. Subsection 1 requires a local housing authority to secure that advice and information is available and assistance in making such an application. Then, subsection 2, they shall secure the applicant is informed of their rights. Um, every application must be considered subsection 3 and then the scheme in the allocation scheme is Section 167. Allocation is to be in accordance with the allocation scheme. Every local authority should have an allocation scheme for determining priorities, and as for the procedure to be followed in allocating housing accommodation for this purpose, the procedure includes all aspects of the allocation process, and the scheme is to include a statement of the authorities policy on offering people who are to be allocated housing accommodations, choice of accommodation for the opportunity to express preferences, mhm and then subsection 2. As regards priorities, the scheme should be framed so as to secure that reasonable preference is given to 5 categories of people, the first of whom is persons who are homeless within the meaning of part seven and then one sees after little A, the scheme may also be framed so far give additional preference to particular descriptions of people within the subsections. People with urgent housing needs and to a the scheme mate may contain provisions for determining priorities and allocating accommodation people within subsection 2 and the factors which the scheme may allow to be taken into account and over the page one seasons halfway down, the page in subsection for the Secretary of State may make regulations subsection 5 procedure actually framed in accordance with principles prescribed by the Secretary of State. But subject to that, the authority may decide on the principles to be framed and then subsection aid that the authorities shall not allocate housing accommodation except in accordance with their allocation scheme. Have then my Lord and my Lady, we come to part 7 homelessness"
p1,00:21:08.350,00:21:26.970,spk_2,"before you leave that is there an equivalent to section 1935, where one has this formality of the letter and you're given notice that if you refuse the accommodation, the duty will cease to exist. I don't think there is. In part 6, I"
p1,00:21:26.980,00:21:28.130,spk_1,don't think there is.
p1,00:21:28.140,00:21:37.580,spk_2,"On the other hand, we know letters were sent in these cases yet, but they didn't have the same effect as a refusal of a Part seven offer."

p1,00:22:01.990,00:25:59.830,spk_1,"distinct part of the act relating to homelessness. Part 7, uh, Section 175 defines homelessness and threatened homelessness. Uh, Section 176. The meaning of accommodation available for occupation and sex, 177 deals with whether it's reasonable to continue to occupy accommodation. I think I could go a number of pages forward to page 20 of the extract, a group of sections dealing with applications for assistance in case of homelessness or threatened homelessness. Section 183, the application following provisions of this part apply where a person applies to a local housing authority for accommodation for assistance in explaining it, and the authorities have reason to believe that he is or may be homeless or threatened with homelessness. Section 184 then relates to the inquiry to be made. If there is that reason to believe, then the authorities shall make such enquiries as necessary to satisfy themselves. Firstly, whether he is eligible for assistance and secondly, if so, whether any duty and if so, what duty is owed to him under the following provisions of this part. And then there's a notification requirement of the outcome and reasons in subsection 3 and then and section 188 at the bottom of page 25 there is an interim duty to accommodate in case of apparent priority need. Section 189 relates to priority needs. The various categories, including little be a person with whom dependent Children reside or might reasonably be expected to reside covers both present cases and then dealing with the post inquiry situation. The post Interim situation from Section 19 onwards the duty to duties The person is found to be homeless or threatened with homelessness. First of all, in section one, I know the duty to persons becoming homeless intentionally. So not our case and section 191 begin deals with becoming homeless intentionally in section 192 duty to persons not in priority need who are not homeless intentionally again not our case and then section 193 is our case duty to persons with priority need who are not homeless intentionally. This section applies where the authorities are satisfied that an applicant is homeless eligible for assistance has a priority need and they're not satisfied that he became homeless intentionally Unless the authority refer the application to another local housing authority doesn't arise here They shall secure that accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant. That in our submission is the key provisions they shall secure that accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant and then subsection three The authority are subject to the duty under this section until it ceases by virtue of any of the following provisions of this section and subsection five. The local authorities shall cease to be subject to the duty under the section if the applicant this having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and it is right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation. Secondly, refuses an offer of accommodation. And thirdly, that's an offer of accommodation which the authorities are satisfied is suitable for"

p1,00:26:01.500,00:27:03.020,spk_1,"Then the authority may notify him that they regard themselves as having discharge their duty. Under this section, the local authority subsection 6 will cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant ceases to be eligible, comes homeless, intentionally accepts an offer of accommodation under part 6, or accepts an offer of an assured tenancy or otherwise voluntarily ceases to occupy as his only or principle home. The accommodation made available for his occupation. The authorities should also cease to be subject to the duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequences, refusal and it is right to request the review of the suitability of the accommodation refuses a final offer of accommodation under part 6. An offer of accommodation under part 6 is a final offer for the purposes of sub seven if it's made in writing and states that it is a final offer for the purposes of subsection at 7."

p1,00:27:05.770,00:28:03.850,spk_1,"my Lord. Before leaving these predictions, I should refer also further on to section 22 at page 44. That's the right to request a review. The applicant has a right to request a review in various circumstances and subsection three, the request for review must be made within 21 days or such longer period as may be allowed. And on a request being duly made, the authority shall review the decision and then on page 47 section 4. There's a right of appeal to the county court on a point of law.

p1,00:29:00.740,00:30:04.660,spk_1,"I mean, is there an initial decision taking us to that? Or is that I think the practise of the authority and no doubt of housing authorities generally is to make a composite decision rather than to have give her a ruling on the question of whether or not the letter has been received, and then to deal separately with any further questions that may arise? But only on review that the whole question is whether this letter has been received can arise. Oh, no. The because the initial decision is based on the premise that the letter was sent and received, Um, letter simply says, surely the you know, we've we've often do suitable accommodation and our duties discharged. It doesn't actually. The crucial letter is the earlier letter that says, You're offered this accommodation and if you don't take it, that's it. I know."

Of course, the duty may cease not only under subsection five, but under subsection six or under subsection seven and the interrelationship between 57 and 7 a is by no means a straightforward question.

Then yes, there remedy is to pursue a review to revisit that question. So the review is the first time which anybody is actually going to be decided yes or no. Was the letter received?

p1,00:32:37.740,00:32:38.450,spk_1,"Yeah,"
p1,00:32:39.240,00:32:59.350,spk_0,"you've sent me this letter, but I never got the letter of the 14th of March and surely it will be open to a housing officer if confronted with somebody saying that if they believe them to say Okay, I I believe it. Why should they not?"
p1,00:32:59.840,00:33:01.160,spk_1,No reason.
p1,00:33:01.540,00:33:14.160,spk_0,"I mean, I appreciate the first formal opportunity to say I never got it is on the review to a senior officer. But if you can persuade the junior officer that you didn't get the letter,"
p1,00:33:14.840,00:33:28.030,spk_1,"Yes, but that, of course, does presuppose that you're aware that a letter was sent, which if you didn't receive it, you wouldn't normally be aware until the authority indicates that they are resigning from their duty."
p1,00:33:28.140,00:33:38.210,spk_0,"That's what I mean. In response to the letter of the 21st of March, Mrs Ali goes along to whoever the author, the author of that letter is and says,"
p1,00:33:39.840,00:33:41.500,spk_1,whoever
p1,00:33:41.500,00:33:59.450,spk_0,"she's been dealing with Phil Dolan and says, hang on you say you sent me, you made me an offer. On the 14th of March or I never got any formal letter. All I had was a phone call or whatever it was that caused me to go along to see the property."
p1,00:34:00.140,00:34:23.960,spk_1,"Yeah, and so the matter would then arise at that stake in that way, Um, well, does that takes three weeks. Is it too late then to seek a review? It's too late to seek a review once, three weeks have gone unless time is extended where there is a powerful time to be extended."
p1,00:34:24.940,00:34:25.360,spk_0,
p1,00:34:26.040,00:35:01.470,spk_1,"But of course, if one hadn't received a letter telling one that the duty has been discharged, then you would have a rather strong case for saying that you could review have the review out of time. If you do get that letter of Mrs Ali, this is Ibrahim got that letter then, of course, they know, then proceeded on the basis that they had received an earlier letter that they have not received, and there's no reason why they shouldn't put in their their application for review in the normal way within the 21 days."
p1,00:35:02.140,00:35:40.770,spk_2,"Well, when can see to some extent in paragraph 7 of the statement of facts and issues the way in which it works out until that stage is reached because she said, she wasn't told what the address was that she was supposed to go to to view, and there was a telephone conversation and she was given the address. So there's a certain amount of common sense and practical solutions brought to their initially, which may take various forms. But the critical point is when the the final letter set out, I think, on the 21st of March declaring that because the offer has been refused, the duty ceases to exist. And that takes us into the regulations"
p1,00:35:40.950,00:38:10.150,spk_1,"because the regulations provide a fairly limited form of review. Its part three of the regulations page three of the last had in the same bundle, Um, and on page 3 of the extra print out is part 3 of the regulations that relate to homelessness regulation 6. Request for a review and notification of review procedure, request for a review under Section 202 should be made to the authority. There's no complication here as to which authority and then sub 2 to accept where a case falls within regulation 7, which isn't relevant for our purposes. The authority for whom a request for a review has been made shall notify the applicant that he or someone acting on his behalf may make representations in writing to the authority in connection with the review. So that's the limit of it at the rate at that stage, namely to make representations and to do so in writing. But then Regulation 8 procedure on a review. The reviewer shall, um, uh, consider any representations made under Regulation 6 and any representations made under paragraph 2, paragraph 2 deals with the situation of the reviewer considers the deficiency or irregularity in the original decision or in the manner in which it was may, but is minded nonetheless to make a decision, which is against the interests of the applicant on one or more issues. If that is so, then the reviewers shall notify the applicant that the reviewer is so minded. And the reasons why and that the applicant or someone acting on his behalf may make representations to the reviewer orally or in writing or both orally and in writing. So it is still a matter of representations only, but in and only in the subsection two situation at least the representations maybe oral as well as or in stead of and in writing. That's the extent of the review."
p1,00:38:10.160,00:38:19.380,spk_2,Could one also perhaps notice regulation 2 on page 2? Who is to make the decision on review?
p1,00:38:19.390,00:38:20.170,spk_1,"Yes,"
p1,00:38:20.180,00:38:24.750,spk_2,"because that bears on issues. Yes,"
p1,00:38:24.760,00:38:26.520,spk_1,the someone
p1,00:38:26.530,00:38:27.540,spk_2,someone different was
p1,00:38:27.540,00:38:32.410,spk_1,not involved in the original decision. And who is senior to the officer who made the original.
p1,00:38:32.620,00:38:35.890,spk_2,"But nevertheless, you say it is an officer of the authority"
p1,00:38:37.690,00:39:19.910,spk_1,"making decisions which have resource implications for the authority and and as I shall come to later, the review procedure, uh compares in our submission unfavourably with the review with the review or appeal procedure in relation to housing benefit with which the Strasbourg court was concerned. In the Tsfayo case upon which we rely, my Lord, our submission on determination of civil rights proceeds in the following stages. First, a statutory"
p1,00:39:19.920,00:39:21.840,spk_0,entitlement
p1,00:39:22.620,00:43:18.130,spk_1,"arising where particular qualifying conditions are met constitutes are right. My Lord, that's not an issue. Secondly, Section 193 subsection 2 of the Housing Act confers such a right again, not an issue. Yeah, thirdly, and again, not an issue that right continues until it ceases by virtue of any of the following provisions of Section 193. And fourthly, we submit this is where one does enter into controversy. We submit that the decision ultimately by the review officer, that the right has since with the determination of a civil right for article 6 purposes and that's the nub of the matter. For the purposes of the first issue my Lord's and my Lady, it is well established and not in dispute that is generally sufficient in order to constitute a civil right for article 6 purposes for there to be an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. So the 6 necessary and we say sufficient components of the civil right. First of all, that there is a right. Secondly, that the right is an economic right. Thirdly, that the economic right is an individual, right? Fourthly, that the right flows from rules. Fifthly, that those are specific rules, and sixthly that there are rules laid down in the statute in our case, shortly stated as we submit that each of those components is manifestly fully satisfied, that, looking at the question whether there is an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute was established as being the appropriate test by the Strasbourg court in cases such as Salesi and Italy and Mennitto and Italy. Cases involving non contributory social welfare benefits as do the present cases and that principle, we say, applies here that the right to accommodation is an individual right as much as any cash benefit. It's an economic right as much as any cash benefit. It flows from specific rules in part 7 of the Housing Act. And we submit the fact that part 7 of the Housing Act may be regarded as part of a scheme of social welfare provision does not affect the salacious classification. Again, it's clearly established by a series of Strasbourg decisions and is not in dispute that the right to a social Security or welfare benefit is not withstanding its public nature well capable of being a civil right,"
p1,00:43:18.230,00:43:59.610,spk_2,"two points, the first is a specific one. I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean by an individual right, except perhaps it's the right given to an individual. Is that what you really mean? So a particular person can stand up and say I am the person to whom that right has given yes, right, I understand that. The other point is that looking at your 6, your list of 6 things, it strikes me that it has a very wide reach, actually, and the whole area of social provision. We're dealing obviously with housing, but it may be difficult to see where one stops if you're right about that, these are the components and the only components you need to have."
p1,00:44:00.090,00:44:25.920,spk_1,"Well, there will be situations which will clearly be on the other side of the line, so that if, for example, one takes part 6 of the Housing Act that we looked at briefly on allocation as indeed the House of Lords held in the [Inaudible] case that does not give right to any individual rights dealing with priorities of allocation, it doesn't give any individual any individual right."
p1,00:44:27.090,00:44:39.220,spk_0,"The National Health Service. The duty of the Secretary of State to provide a national health service, I think, is sitting there in Section one of the National Health Service Act that doesn't give rise to any individual rights to anything at all."
p1,00:44:40.070,00:44:53.150,spk_1,"the plenty of examples of that. But I do accept, however, that certainly there are situations outside the housing field to which the same submissions will apply. I"

p1,00:44:56.190,00:44:56.830,spk_2,case.
p1,00:44:56.830,00:45:00.040,spk_0,"Of course, we heard all this argument at some considerable length"
p1,00:45:00.050,00:46:02.610,spk_1,"I'm going to seek to avoid too pursue this issue at any great length or to go back to material which, at any rate, some members of this court very familiar. But the proposition that, the social welfare schemes are not excluded on account of there being a public nature in our submission as well established and indeed has been established by Strasbourg authorities going back to Feldbrugge and Deumeland in the mid eighties and clearly stated, for example, in Schuler-Zgraggen and Switzerland more recently and indeed, as we shall see in Tsfayo itself. So it's no longer therefore controversial that the concept of the determination of a civil right extends too many questions arising in public law."
p1,00:46:02.670,00:46:02.750,spk_2,I
p1,00:46:02.750,00:47:11.610,spk_1,"mean, is yours business go to the position here is really no different from what it would be instead of 193, saying they've got shall provide suitable accommodation, it said, On these preconditions, being satisfied, they shall produce £10,000 outright. Exactly we say it's exactly the same. If you were provided with money with a view to it, assisting you with your housing difficulties that would plainly be caught. And our submission, the fact that we're looking at a benefit in kind rather than a cash benefit doesn't make a difference. And indeed, what we say it comes to is that if the right conferred by Section 193 is a right to a welfare benefit, then the right plainly does fall within Article 6 unless there is sufficient reason to exclude it and that the issue therefore effectively resolves itself into the question. Does the fact that Section 193 provides for a benefit in kind a right to accommodation rather than a benefit in cash? Take it outside the general rule."
p1,00:47:11.620,00:47:43.600,spk_2,"There is a difference between the two because the right to cash amount, I'm assuming, is simply a matter of calculation, and the arithmetic does. It provides the answer for you, whereas the word accommodation in Subsection 2 does conceal within it issues which need to be addressed and we can see later on issues of suitability and so on have to be considered. So you can't actually say at the stage of Subsection 2 that the individual can point to a particular address and say, That is my entitlement."
p1,00:47:44.280,00:49:39.540,spk_1,"But certainly the entitlement may mature in stages. Just as entitled to cash entitlement may mature in stages. You have a stage which establishes you're entitled to get a cash payment. You have a later stage, which quantifies what the amount of the cash payment will be. So, too, with a benefiting time. It's a very real right. You have an entitlement to have accommodation secured, Um, but then certainly there will be the working out of the question of which precise accommodation that will be, there will come a point, of course, when there will be an entitlement to accommodation at a particular address. But in our submission, one is plainly in the arena of civil rights and that there's no reason in principle why there should be an exclusion from the general principle by reference to the benefit being one in kind. In terms of subsistence, a roof over one's head is as vital as money in one's pocket and and may not be achievable other than in kind. If one doesn't have money in one pocket to acquire one's own accommodation in one shape or form, we submit that there is no Strasbourg authority which supports any exclusion of benefits in kind, and we submit that such Strasbourg authorities, that is, on the particular point tends to support their not being such an exclusion, my Lords and my Lady. You would have seen in our printed case that in this connection, we refer to a series of Strasbourg cases against Russia, decided after Runa Begum and considered, of course, in the in A and Croydon and M and Lambeth cases."
p1,00:49:39.550,00:49:58.000,spk_2,"it didn't really seem to take the argument very far today because I'm right there all cases where it was really a question of giving effect to an order. The Russian cases, I mean, that's very interesting. It's quite clear cut, but it doesn't really solve our problem in this case."
p1,00:49:58.470,00:52:06.070,spk_1,"Well, there are two points I think I need to deal with in relation to the Russia cases. One is the point that's taken against me by the respondents in the intervening on this appeal that they're cases about enforcement of judgments and therefore, of no health. In a case such as this, which is not about enforcement of the judgement we submit, that's a bad point. And secondly, there is the point which commended itself to this court in the prison process of commending itself to this court in the Croydon and Lambeth cases, namely, that they proceed on a concession or an assumption rather than addressing the issue head on. My Lord, as to the first point in our submission, their case is not merely about the enforcement of judgement watch, but about property rights, right to a tenancy rights to accommodation and importantly, about maintaining consistency of approach in relation to Article six on the one hand and after one of the first protocol. On the other hand, my Lord, no doubt the cases would not have been cases capable of becoming before the Strasbourg court if the enforcement of the judgement was in relation to a right which was not a civil right and the judgement, certainly in at least the [Inaudible] and Sypchenko cases clearly expressed both on the basis of the enforcement of the judgement and of property rights, my Lord, we submit that the Russian cases should not be dismissed simply on the basis. There was apparently no argument upon the question whether a duty to provide social housing gives rise to civil right. The Strasbourg court was at least plainly content to accept that there was but my Lords. In any event, we rely on the decision of the Strasbourg court in second, the United Kingdom,"
p1,00:52:06.910,00:52:07.110,spk_0,in
p1,00:52:07.110,00:53:06.950,spk_1,"support of the important and relevant principle of achieving consistency of approach in relation to Article 6 and Article 1 of the first protocol. My Lord, that is the admissibility opinion decision of the Strasbourg Court in Stec referred by to by your Lordship in the Croydon and Lambeth case, not the final decision in Stec, which is in the bundles of authorities. But my Lord, our learned friend has very helpfully prepared a supplemental bundle of authorities, which includes, the fourth tab, the admissibility decision in Stec, which is the more relevant one for the present purposes, and Lord, Stec of course, has been applied by the House of Lords in the R (On the application of RGM, the Work and Pensions Secretary), which is among the authorities."
p1,00:53:06.960,00:53:09.480,spk_2,Are we applying the admissibility decision?
p1,00:53:09.580,00:54:03.120,spk_1,"You're applying the admissibility. Ms Leaving was in that case and my Lord in the State's admissibility decision, it is particularly the paragraphs from paragraph 46 onwards. The approach to be applied. It's necessary to examine the pressure. The question whether a claim to a non contributory welfare benefits should protect protection of after one a critical one and paragraph 47. The convention must be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between the various provisions going to various earlier cases. It's noteworthy in this respect that in the case law on the applicability of Article 6, the court originally held the claims regarding only welfare benefits which form part of contributory"
p1,00:54:03.120,00:54:03.750,spk_2,schemes
p1,00:54:04.210,00:55:29.580,spk_1,"were because of the similarity private insurance schemes sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of dispute for the determination of civil rights, see Feldbrugge and Deumeland. However, in the Salesi v Italy judgement Article 61 was held by a dispute over entitled to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising the the applicant had an assertive all right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison private insurance schemes and the requirement reform of contract between the individual and the State. In Schuler-Zgraggen, the court held development in the law and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance insurance, including even welfare assistance, then this important passage in paragraph 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the conventions that, the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one of protocol, one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights under Article 6(1). And we would submit, like quite the converse. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation about one of protocol, one which avoids inequalities, treatment based on distinctions, which at the present day, imperial logical or unsustainable."
p1,00:55:29.590,00:55:59.360,spk_0,"So how I got this right that the chronology is that it was decisions under Article 6 that first recognised that non contributory cash state benefits were a civil right, and it was because of that that in Stec, they said, and its property within the meaning of Article 1 of protocol 1 that's that's the right way around. Not that somebody decided it was property under Article 1 of Protocol 1, and therefore somebody said, Well, of course, Article 6 must apply."

p1,00:56:20.650,00:56:25.790,spk_2,"in paragraph 50 I think is designed in that way. Really, Um,"
p1,00:56:25.950,00:57:15.750,spk_1,"it's expressed in terms of benefits Social Security and welfare benefits. Um, it doesn't tie it to cash benefits, but nor does it in terms. Say that it includes benefits in kind as well. In the particular case was concerned with cash benefits so that the question of benefits in kind is not dealt with in terms of paragraph 50. But, of course, although an entitlement to financial benefits can be an Article one protocol one possession, what is being held instead? A [Inaudible] accommodation is an entitlement to accommodation. Is an Article 1 protocol, 1 benefit."

And with all that in our submission is the present situation. Once the local authority are satisfied, the statutory criteria for providing accommodation exists, then the authority has no discretion. They have to provide the accommodation and they have to do so. I say they have to provide. They have to secure its provisions. It doesn't have direct. They have to secure its provisions and have to do so irrespective of resource considerations, irrespective of local conditions of demand and supply. And we rely on this connection."

We respectfully submit that the position is as stated by Baroness Hale, then Lady Justice Hale in the Adan v Newham case, not the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal.

The European Court of Human Rights has held that the general rule is that Article 6(1) does apply in the field of social insurance, including even welfare assistance see Schuler-Zgraggen, see also Feldbrugge and Deumeland . Those cases were concerned what we would call social security benefits. But the court pointed out that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, the applicant was not only affected in her relations with the administrative authorities as such, but also suffered an interference with her means of subsistence. She was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in case of Germany in a federal statute and then continuing with the judgement to claim for accommodation under part 7 is also it is accepted for present purposes, such a right once the locals and then this is the key passage. Once the local authority are satisfied that the statutory criteria for providing accommodation exists, they have no discretion. They have to provide its irrespective of local conditions of demand and supply, hence this is more akin to a claim for Social Security benefits than it is a claim for social or other services where the authorities have a greater degree of discretion and resource considerations may also be relevant. Nevertheless, as Miss Booth points out the nature of the decision making process required by Article 61 differs according to the nature of the right being claimed, referring to Albert v Belgium adopting the concept of full jurisdiction. As Lord Hoffmann explained in Alconbury, subsequent European authorities shows the full jurisdiction does not mean full decision making power. It means full jurisdiction to deal with the case, as the nature of the decision requires. In assessing the sufficiency of the decision making process, under part seven must be relevant that authorities, with all the internal external controls to which they are subject to involved. On the other hand, decisions to house the homeless are quite different. The Secretary of State's decisions and planning and compulsory purchase with which the House of Lords was concerned, and Alconbury in that case, Will Hoffman drew a distinction between policy decisions what interest requires, which one would expect. One would expect to be taken by democratically accountable bodies and the determination of rights and then a short quotation followed by this. Decisions are under part seven of the 1996 Act's and not in any sense policy decisions as to what the public interest requires. And the policy decisions were taken by Parliament when it enacted the 1996 Act. Individual eligibility decisions are taken in the first instance by local housing authorities. But policy questions to the availability of resources or equity between the homeless and those on the waiting list for social housing are irrelevant to individual eligibility. Or we respectfully adopt all of that. My Lord, while we have the case to hand later on in the judgement of Lady Justice Hale observations which in our submission are relevant on the question of whether"

p1,01:06:51.970,01:07:17.990,spk_1,"results, which we contend can be achieved by means of section three of the Act rather than having to be a declaration of incompatibility. Lady Hale refers to the middle of page 2142 uh, to the guidance by Lord Steyn in the Ringeisen case, perhaps still the high water mark of section 3. I may put it that way um,"
p1,01:07:18.670,01:07:21.170,spk_0,"1 or 2. Since then. Yes,"
p1,01:07:21.180,01:09:13.480,spk_1,"indeed. And and then a paragraph 75 on page 2143. okay, deals with the timing of the Ringeisen case and the Human Rights Act. And then just between F and G, this case would involve interpreting the words point of law arising from the decision. Or, as the case may be, the original decision. That is the words in Section 204 of the Housing Act to include the question whether the decision making process as a whole, complies with article six in the particular circumstances of the case, this seems to me to be plainly a point of law. The court reaches the conclusion. The process will only comply with Article 6 if the court reaches its own conclusion on disputed questions of fact, and it can indeed must give effect to its disposal powers. Under Section 204(3). It's procedural powers under the civil procedure rules so as to make good the deficiency. And then this is taken further paragraph 80. I therefore see the two possibilities as cumulative rather than alternative. I'm prepared to accept that the local authority may choose to contract out some or all of its reviews to a body whose constitution and procedures enabled the decision to comply with Article 6. But if they do not do so and the particular issues in the case require an independent decision, then the court should fill the gap again. We respectfully adopt that. In fact, on the issue of whether the review procedure can be contracted out, which the House of Lords in Runa Begum was rather inclined to think might not be possible. The Court of Appeal has since held with the candidate. I"
p1,01:09:13.480,01:09:35.880,spk_2,"think it's worth noticing in the I think it's the second sentence in paragraph 81. Lady Hale, remember? I'm sure, but it looked so the discussion was one which was proceeding on a fair amount of acceptance by parties. It was a possible approach. Yes, I think in this case, since not ground is not quite so, so smooth."

p1,01:09:59.970,01:10:09.420,spk_0,"Of course, one has to remember that Adan was decided. It was argued very shortly after the Act was in force."
p1,01:10:09.430,01:13:18.070,spk_1,"Yes. And okay. And my Lord, It is, of course, an important feature of the statutory scheme. Yeah, that someone who is in priority need and not homeless intentionally and who is entitled to accommodation doesn't lose that accommodation because they decline a particular offer of accommodation which they don't regard as being suitable unless it has, in terms been drawn to their attention that they will lose the right. So it is important whether or not a letter of this kind is received. And more generally, part seven of the act relating to duties the homeless and their entitlements is very different from part six relating to the regulation of schemes for the allocation of housing and not giving anyone a right to accommodation. My Lord is it, um, said in this respect, part 7 of the Housing Act is similar to section 20 subsection 1 of the 1989 Children Act. Then I respond. Yes, in many ways it is. And that that assists me in that if who is a child is a question of precedent or jurisdictional fact on the construction of the Children's Act. That one has, of course, to look at the construction in our case of the Housing Act. And what as this court has seen, is in terms of Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. The first gateway question of fact is what the applicant informed of the possible consequences of refusal and the right to review. If so, the second gateway question of fact is, Did the applicant refused the accommodation? And then it's both those facts are established so that one is through the two gateways. Then one has the further question, not a question of fact arising. The Runa Begum question whether the authority are satisfied that the accommodation was suitable. So if and insofar as the authority is relying on Section 193, subsection 5, there are two gateway questions of fact. And then the suitability issue. If they're relying on Section 193, subsection seven, then that is exclusively a question of fact. And my Lord, What we say is that these gateway questions of fact or exclusive questions of fact are eminently questions for a court, either as precedent questions or subsequent questions upon review for appeal."

p1,01:13:21.650,01:14:14.930,spk_1,"Lord, therefore, in our submission, there is a determination of civil rights and and the determination not being by an independent tribunal. The situation is one that can be saved if, but only if the determination can be reviewed by a court with full jurisdiction. And that, of course, is the second issue does full jurisdiction entails a full merits review in cases such as the present and full jurisdiction, of course, is not a static concept. Rather, it reflects the nature of the decision in the particular case and my Lord, in determining what full jurisdiction entails, is of course necessary to consider the subject matter of the decision,"
p1,01:14:17.040,01:14:17.210,spk_0,the
p1,01:14:17.210,01:17:46.550,spk_1,"manner in which the decision was arrived at and the content of the dispute, as the Strasbourg court has made clear. In Bryan and other cases, my Lord fundamental for present purposes is the materiality of the distinction between on the one hand an administrative decision, which require the exercise by experts as a policy, banks discretion, not the present cases and on the other hand, decisions which as here turn on issues of simple primary fact and no more in the former category. Of course, judicial review or appeal on law only as that concept is conventionally understood will suffice. But not in the latter category. And my Lord we submit that the decision of the House of Lords in Runa Begum comes within the former category, concerned as it was with suitability of accommodation. My Lord, Runa Begum is in volume 4 of the authorities a tab 20. The decision and early 2003. Okay. Yes, my Lord's first at page 438 of the appeal cases report for Runa Begum, paragraph to the parties were agreed that the appeal raised 3 questions which they express in this way was the review officer's decision on protection to to a determination of civil rights within the meaning of Article 61. If so, did she constitute an independent, impartial tribunal for the purposes of that article? If not, the county court on appeal under section 204 possess full jurisdiction so as to guarantee compliance with Article 6(1). And the second of these questions is answered in paragraph three, not independent. That's an integral feature of the scheme. Paragraph 4, one other question inherent in the first question also lends itself to a summary answer. Whether for the purposes of domestic law, Runa Begum enjoyed anything properly recognised as a right, the authorities suggested. No I cannot accept this. Section 1932 imposed a duty on the authority to secure that accommodation was available for her occupation. This was a duty owed to an enforceable by her, related to a matter of acute concern to her, although Section 26 permitted the authority to performance duty in one of several ways. And although performance calls for the exercise of judgement by the authorities, I think it plain that the authorities duty gave rise to a pluralative in Runa Begum , even though this was not a private law rights enforceable by injunction and damages. The first question differently expressed is whether Runa Begum's right recognised in domestic law, also a civil rights in the autonomous meaning given to that expression for purposes of one of the convention."
p1,01:17:47.430,01:17:49.130,spk_2,Thus far we're in the same territory.
p1,01:17:49.840,01:17:50.470,spk_1,"Yes, my Lord"
p1,01:17:50.470,01:17:51.870,spk_2,
p1,01:17:52.940,01:20:01.620,spk_1,"thus far, I support what the decision says, the reasons that are there given. But then, on the question of civil rights from paragraph five onwards where reference is made to Alconbury, Lord Bingham states at paragraph 6, the European courts approach to rights deriving from social welfare schemes has been complicated by differences of legal tradition in various Member States. As Lord Hoffman explained in Alconbury comparison Feldbrugge in the Netherlands and  Deumeland in Germany in the 1986 with Salesi and Italy, and Mennitto and Italy shows movement from a narrower towards a broader interpretation of civil rights. Further cases made no doubt continue that trend to hold that the right enjoyed by Runa Begum, is a civil right for purposes of Article 6 would, however, to be go further than the Strasbourg court has yet gone. And I'm satisfied that in the light of a compelling argument on this point by Mr Salesi, the Secretary of State, that the decision of this court would not many means necessarily be favourable to Runa Begum so I prefer to assume without deciding that Runa Begum's domestic law right is also a civil right and to consider whether on that assumption. But having regard to the nature of the right. The statutory provisions of an appeal to the county court on a point of law satisfies the requirements. Article 6 although the county court jurisdictions appellate's substance the same as that of the high Court in judicial review. Thus the court may not only quashed the authority's decision under 243, it's held to be officiated by legal misdirection or procedural impropriety or unfairness or bias or irrationality or bad faith, but also if there is no evidence to support factual findings made or they are plainly untenable, or if the decision maker is shown to have misunderstood or been ignorant of an established, in relevant fact,"
p1,01:20:01.630,01:20:06.220,spk_2,"this is fairly familiar stuff is describing the nature of the reviews? Yes, yes,"
p1,01:20:07.110,01:23:43.830,spk_1,"um, and therefore of its limitations can deal with all these issues, but no further. And no such question in paragraph 8 is this. Equality is this quality rather review sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 61 on the assumption that a civil right is an issue playing that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact and must accept apparently credible conclusions on credibility made on behalf of the authorities. The question is whether this limitation on the county court judges role deprives him of the jurisdiction necessary. Satisfy the requirements of Article 61 in the present context. In approaching this question, I regard three matters as particularly pertinent. First of all, part 7 is only part of a far reaching statutory scheme regulating the important social field of housing administration that scheme very largely entrusted to local housing authorities. While the homelessness provisions are intended to assist those individuals who are or may become homeless, there is a wider public dimension to the problem of homelessness. Secondly, although, as in the present case an authority may have to resolve disputes, factual issues, it's factual findings will only be staging posts on the way too much the much broader judgments which the authority has made in deciding whether it owes the full housing duty to an applicant under Section 1931, the authority has to be satisfied of 3 matters and not satisfied of another. Under 1937(b), the authority ceases to be subject full housing duty if it is satisfied that the accommodation offered to the applicant was suitable for the applicant and that it was reasonable for him to accept it. Thus, it is the authorities judgement which matters, and it is unlikely to be a simple factual decision. Yes, and then Thirdly, there's reference to the review regulations, and over the page of Paragraph 10 was referenced the question of contracting out, whether that be desirable or not, and in paragraph 11 in relation to the requirements of Article 6(1) are supplied to the review by a court that administrative decision made by a body not closed with the independence and impartiality required of Judicial Tribunal. The Strasbourg jurisprudence, as in relation to civil rights, has shown a degree of flexibility in its search for just and workman like submission solutions and then certain recent authorities of particular importance, including Byran and the UK and Kingsley in the UK amongst others. None of these cases is indistinguishable from the present, but taken together, they provide compelling support the conclusion that in a context such as this, the absence of a full fact finding jurisdiction in the tribunal, which appeal lies for an administrative decision making body does not disqualify that tribunal for the purpose of Article 6(1). This is a conclusion which I accept more readily because it gives effect to a procedure laid down by Parliament, which should properly operated, ensure fair treatment that such as Runa Begum Then there is the speech of Lord Hoffmann, and I can perhaps pick that up at paragraph 27 on page 445."
p1,01:23:43.840,01:23:48.260,spk_2,It's worth noting in passing is that he refers to he

p1,01:23:56.180,01:25:48.150,spk_1,"Yeah, just refer briefly, if I may, to 27 but that's really on the point of Independent tribunal. So it is paragraph 28. I returned to the other two issue in dispute, and then refers to how they may relate to each other, referring to a dissenting opinion in Feldbrugge. Then in paragraph 29, the Strasbourg court has been left to develop the law. It's done so in two ways. First, it's been concerned to ensure that State parties do not exploit the gap left in Article 6 by changing their laws so as to convert a question which would ordinarily be regarded as appropriate. The civil adjudication into an administrative decision outside the reach of the article has done this by treating civil rights and obligations as an autonomous concept not dependent upon the domestic law, classification, right or obligation, which the citizens should have access to a court to determine, referring to Goudie in paragraph 30. The second development has been the doctrine, starting with Ringeisen in Austria in 1971 by which the Strasbourg court has extended Article 6 to cover a wide range of administrative decision making on the ground that the decision determines or decisively affects rights or obligations in private law. In a reference to Alconbury and then more recently, the scope of Article 6 has also been extended to public law rights, such as entitlement to Social Security or Welfare Benefit, and the publicly funded statutory schemes on the ground that they closely resemble writes in private law, referring to Salesi v Italy."

Note the last sentence that the applicant was making submissions both for a prospective claim against the housing and council tax benefit and to a backdated claims both those benefits and that the prospective claim was successful. But the council rejected the application for backdated benefit because she failed to show good cause. Why she'd not claim the benefits earlier."
p1,01:30:24.110,01:30:26.960,spk_2,So that was the battleground for Strasbourg
p1,01:30:26.970,01:34:30.950,spk_1,"That was the battleground in Strasbourg. And then one sees that the fifth paragraph paragraph of the head note. The Council's Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit Review Board rejected the applicant's appeal against the refusal to pay backdated Council tax and housing benefit based on a rejection of their evidence that she had not received the relevant correspondence concerning the renewal of their claims. In that respect, very similar to our case then in the judgement then Housing Benefit Scheme is described paragraph 19 onwards, um of the court's judgement. Housing benefit is a means tested benefit payable towards housing costs in rented accommodation, so benefiting in cash very akin to the benefiting kind. Under the homelessness legislation, it's not dependent on or linked to the payment of contributions by the claimant. So a non contributory benefit administered by the local authority payments subsidised by central government, normally to the extent of 95%. Although where benefit is paid as a result of decisions that have good calls for a late claim subsidies, only 50% housing benefit is awarded for benefit periods an entitlement for each period, depending on a claim being made in time in accordance with the statutory rules. If a claimant makes a late claim, any entitlement to arrears depends on the claims establishing good cause for having missed the deadline. Case law establishes that the concept of good cause involves an objective judgement as to whether this individual claimant with his or her characteristics did what could reasonably have been expected of them. Then there's a description of the board at the relevant time. A claim was first considered by officials employed by the local authority working their housing department. If the benefit was refused, the claimant was invited to review first to the by the local authority itself, then by a board which comprised up to five elected counsellors from the local authority since replaced by tribunals. The procedure before the review board was governed by the regulations. Regulation 82 provided and the procedure should be such as the chairman shall determine any person affected may make representations in writing which must be considered, but also little c at the hearing so that the hearing any effective person, has the right to be heard and may be accompanied and may be represented by another person, whether professionally qualified or not and for the purpose of the proceedings at the hearing, any representatives shall have the rights and powers to which any person affected is entitled under these regulations and make all persons to give evidence and may put questions to any person who gives evidence. And the review board may call or for receive or hear representation and evidence from any person present as it considers appropriate. The Review Board's Good Practise Guide provided inter alia that the general principle underlying the proceedings with the observance of natural justice, the board should be fair and be seen to be fair to all parties at all times. The board was in law a separate body from the authority, an independent before the hearing of a case, checks were carried out to ensure the board members had no previous dealings with the case, and they have no relationship with the claimant or any other person effective notwithstanding all that, the court said, this isn't good enough because the body that's determined is made up of counsellors from the authority which have an interest. But my Lord, one does see that that one point apart."
p1,01:34:31.440,01:34:31.670,spk_2,Yeah.
p1,01:34:32.440,01:35:45.220,spk_1,"The provisions for the Regulation 82 yeah, are much more favourable than the provisions in relation to the homelessness review. The board was much nearer to being a court. If I may put it that way, um, than the review officer could be said to be, um, turn from paragraph 27. The Human Rights Court considers administrative decision making under our Human Rights Act, referring to Alconbury and then at paragraph 32 and 31 to Runa and onwards to Runa Begum. And then the refers at paragraph 34, uh, to the board being replaced by tribunals because of concerns about lack of independence with the potential for injustice. And then one comes to the body of the judgement, the alleged violation of Article 61 and 6 Section B of that, the court's assessment begins to paragraph 40. Yes, this"

p1,01:35:46.100,01:35:55.870,spk_1,part. The court recalls that disputes over entitlement to Social Security and welfare benefits generally fall within the scope of Article 6(1).

p1,01:35:56.960,01:36:38.100,spk_1,"rely on that, of course, and say there's no reason why the general provisions shouldn't apply in this particular case. And one sees that general proposition is supported in footnote 16 by reference to Salesi and Mennitto v Italy, and Schuler-Zgraggen and Switzerland and paragraph 40 continues. The court agrees with the parties the applicants claim for housing benefit concerned the determination of the civil rights from the Article 6(1) applied. So although that wasn't an issue, the court did express its agreement as that the applicants, therefore, had a right to a fair hearing before an independent part of funeral. So"
p1,01:36:38.110,01:36:43.710,spk_2,"we take from that that the point wasn't really contested. Yeah,"

p1,01:36:53.130,01:38:23.730,spk_1,"Um, well, then one sees that the board didn't have the necessary structural independence. Paragraph 41 therefore there needs to be controlled by a judicial body that provides full jurisdiction. And then there's reference to Bryan and indeed, a quotation from Bryan at the top of the following page planning case pointed out that there are other cases since that followed Bryan in paragraph 44 and then paragraph 45. The domestic courts have also applied the principles in Bryan, notably the House of Lords in planning case or cranberry, and run a big um. In the latter case, the House of Lords found that judicial review of a Housing Officers decision that the claimant had been unreasonable in rejecting the accommodation offered her provided sufficiency of review of Article 6 purposes. House of Lords stressed that although the housing officer had been called upon to resolve some disputed factory issued, those findings of facts were to use the words of Lord Bingham in that case only staging post on the way to much broader judgments concerning local conditions and the availability of alternative accommodation, which the housing officer had the specialist knowledge and experience to make. Although the housing officer could not be regarded as independent, there were safeguards and so forth departure from the procedural rules would have afforded a ground of appeal."

p1,01:40:34.210,01:40:35.060,spk_0,the
p1,01:40:35.070,01:45:02.710,spk_1,"board there, which has 5 councillors and a review officers such as Runa Begum, and equally obviously here. Yes. I mean, it's a feature of all three cases Runa Begum and Tsfayo, and this case that one does not have the a sufficiently independent tribunal for Article 6 purposes. That's not your Lordships' point, of course. Is that the difference between Tsfayo on the one hand in terms of the way in which the board was composed, and Runa Begum and my case on the other, uh, in terms of the review officer. So in that respect, I'm so to speak on the wrong side of the line in every other respect and in that submission, the respect that matter. I say that I'm firmly on the right side of the line, although one needs to go back to paragraph 46 before coming to paragraph 47. Because, the court says, crucially at the beginning of paragraph 46 the court considers that the decision making process in the present case was significantly different in Bryan, Runa Begum and the other cases cited at paragraph 43 above the issues, to be determined, required a measure of professional knowledge or experience, and the exercise of administrative discretion pursuant to wider policy aims. In contrast, in the instant case, the HBRB was deciding a simple question of fact, namely, whether there was good calls for the applicant's decision in making a claim on this question. The applicant had given evidence that the first she knew that anything was amiss with her claim for benefit was the receipt of a notice from her landlord Housing Association, seeking to repossess a flat because of rent arrears. The Board found her explanation unconvincing and rejected her claim essentially on the basis of her assessment of her credibility. No specialist expertise was required to determine this issue, which is under the new system determined by non specialist tribunal, not unlike the cases referred to and the factual findings in the present case be said to be merely incidental to the reaching a broader judgments of policy or expediency, which it was for the democratically accountable authority to take in two respects. I'm a thought, your eye to the survive situation. I may fall to your eye in that. Whether or not the letter was received is even more conspicuously a question of fact than whether or not there's good cause for delay. And secondly, um, the board has procedures involving a hearing in relation to a credibility issue of a kind that were superior to the provisions that apply in relation to a homelessness review. But Tsfayo, in any event, fully in our submission, supports our case because it draws the distinction on the basis of looking at particular cases between cases which require professional knowledge or experience. And it puts Runa Begum as well as Bryanand other cases such as Alconbury on that side of the line and cases such a survivor itself and such as the present case, where what is being determined is a simple, question of, fact. So, my Lord, that in our submission is the crucial contrast that the court is drawing. And in our submission on that contrast, we are on the Tsfayo side of the line rather than the Runa Begum side of the line my Lord. Then one comes to paragraph 47. Which, my lord, Lord Brown in particular attention trying. He did, because we I think Lady Hale had simply pointed out that there was only a contrast with domestic in 46. I was merely pointing out there was a wider contrast drawn in 47. I do."
p1,01:45:03.590,01:45:03.640,spk_2,I
p1,01:45:03.740,01:45:19.540,spk_1,"would not respectfully accept. It was a wider contrast, but a different contrast, a contrast on a different point, being drawn in paragraph 47. But then one returns in paragraph 48."
p1,01:45:19.550,01:45:57.200,spk_0,"Paragraph 47 is quite interesting, isn't it? And this is something that was discussed, uh, as Lord Hope and I can recall. But unfortunately, the other members of the court cannot in the Croydon case, which is whether there's a distinction being drawn between independence of the executive and independence of the parties to the case. Um, which, you see, it comes in the first sentence of paragraph 47."
p1,01:45:57.690,01:45:59.230,spk_1,Yes.
p1,01:45:59.310,01:46:43.460,spk_0,"Clearly the court was then concerned that it wasn't only officers or administrative officers who are making this decision. It was actually councillors and councillors were parties to the case in a way that seemed they seem to think that officers orbit of the same council perhaps were not when they're looking at Runa Begum and looking at the review officer as somebody who was not independent of the executive but was independent of the the council itself. Uh, well, the section draw, but they seem to be drawing that"
p1,01:46:43.500,01:48:30.260,spk_1,"they do seem to be drawing that distinction when describing the position under our law. In my submission is not a well founded distinction. One cannot distinguish in terms of lack of independence, um, and lack of in whatever sense of independence, according as to whether the decision maker is a member of the council or an officer of the council. So that doesn't work. Perhaps more importantly, when one looks at the structure of the judgement in Tsfayo the beginning of paragraph 46 the court considers that the decision making process in the present case was significantly different. They gave two reasons. The first reason is in paragraph 46. The second reason is in paragraph 47. It's the reason in paragraph 46 upon which I rely, and that's taken up again in paragraph 48. The Applicant had her claim refused because the board did not find her a credible witness whilst the high court had the power to quash the decision. If it considered Inter alia that there was no evidence to support the fact findings or that its findings were clearly untenable or the misunderstood of in ignorance and establishing relevant fact, it did not have jurisdiction to re hear, the evidence will substitute its own view as to the applicants credibility. Thus, in this case, there was never the possibility that the central issue will be determined by a tribunal who was independent of one of the parties to the dispute. It followed. That has been a violation of Article 6(1). But isn't the final sentence of paragraph"
p1,01:48:30.260,01:48:32.290,spk_2,48 picking out 47?
p1,01:48:32.670,01:48:36.240,spk_1,"Yes, and that harks back to 47?"
p1,01:48:36.250,01:49:15.680,spk_2,"Well, I wondered about the first sentence of paragraph 46 that's picking up the last bit of 45 isn't it? Because just taking it the second last sentence of 45. The word, although begins the sentence although the housing officer could not be regarded as independent and so and so on, the statutory regulations provided substantial safeguards to ensure the review would be independently and fairly conducted. That's something that's said to be distinctly different in Tsfayo. And are you accepting that in this case, we're closer to the Runa Begum side of the line?"
p1,01:49:16.070,01:49:36.860,spk_1,"No, my Lord, I'm not but that again comes back to the point to whether officers, um, can really be said to be more independent than members of the same authority. I"
p1,01:49:36.860,01:50:09.410,spk_2,"think, I think sorry to interrupt to it. I think the point they're making is that it would be independently conducted. It's the way the adjective is used there. I think they've already accepted. They can't really be said to be independent after all they are employed. But it's the way in which the thing is conducted there, then looking at and saying, Well, the the process of review that's being set out is one which enables not only fairness but independence to be observed. It's a very subtle kind of distinction again, but this is just wondering what you say"

Whatever you say to the country, Um, notwithstanding, of course, what terms in practical terms on that conclusion, um, but my Lord, a short but important point on Tsfayo, is that it's not drawing a distinction between the housing benefits and the homeless persons scheme. It's drawing a distinction between the situation in Tsfayo itself and the situation in Runa Begum. And in our submission, there's no support in Tsfayo or indeed, elsewhere in the Strasbourg jurisprudence for looking at Article 6 in terms of whole statutes or whole parts of statues. On the contrary, what is required is to look at the features of particular cases. There's simply no sufficient rationale for a one size fits all approach. There's no reason why what may be the right answer under one section of an act should also be the right answer under another section, even in the same part, or indeed, why what is right for one question, under a statutory provision should be right for a very different question, even if it arises under the same statutory provision. Lord, in our submission, the analysis of Tsfayo"
p1,01:54:23.370,01:54:24.570,spk_0,is
p1,01:54:24.570,01:57:58.950,spk_1,"that the decision is predicated on there being a determination of the civil rights. The court then proceeds to distinguish the respective natures of the decisions in Runa Begum and in Tsfayo itself and the although, of course, there are differences between the housing benefit scheme and the homeless scheme. This scheme, what they have in common, outweighs the differences there both schemes of social welfare for the benefit of the public at large. They both contain detailed, self contained and exhausted procedures for enforcing the duties of the authority in relation to determination and and provision of benefits. Neither is enforceable by private law action in relation to what has been provided the features of the scheme, whatever differences there may be at the margins in essential respects, what applies to housing benefit applies to homelessness as well. They are, for present purposes, effectively identical. The only real difference is that housing benefit assessment results in a payment of money, whereas the full housing duty requires accommodation to be secured. But we say that the distinction of type of benefit is not sufficient to permit a completely different approach to be taken between the two welfare benefit schemes, given the fundamental, uh, features that they have in common. And my Lord we do say that in Tsfayo the housing benefit review is in some respects nearer to Article six compliance. And because one has a panel rather than a single individual, one has the right to attend a hearing, right to cross examination and so forth, rather than a procedure in relation to which morality is at best peripheral, as with homelessness, not going beyond at the most. A phone call which may be alright for making representations, but not for deciding issues of credibility or other issues that really require, um, a cross examination of witnesses and my Lord. At any rate, there is some a difference between officers of the authority on the one hand and members on the other is give the members a degree of independence. When one's talking about officers, the two officers, the initial decision making officer and the review officer not only employed by the same authority in the same department in a small authority and although we are concerned City Council, of course, housing is a, uh in two tier areas of local government is dealt with at the district level by the smaller district councils in a small housing authority, not only the review officer and the original decision maker will not only be in the same department, they may even share the same office. And although one is senior to the other, that is not quite the same degree of distinction as there is on the one hand between the officer corps and on the other hand, the elected members."
p1,01:57:58.960,01:58:20.570,spk_2,"At least we don't have, in this case the point that's picked up in 47 about the councillors being the elected members of an authority that suffers a penalty if it allows late payments.

p1,01:58:20.570,01:58:49.860,spk_1,"that would be equally true, of course, if the final decision had been made by officers in the council rather than by members, and the way in which the problem has been overcome of course is not by saying, Let's make it officers, as with homelessness rather than members of the board is saying, Let's have an independent tribunal outside the authority altogether so far as housing benefit is concerned, which is a position which now applies, Um, so the well it"

p1,01:58:57.580,02:00:41.530,spk_1,"by quite a margin. So, yes, there's a financial interest. But equally, of course, the authority has a financial interest in not being under the the duty to provide the accommodation to secure the provision of the accommodation, which is necessarily an expensive matter, uh, for the authority. And so the interest exists either way around, my Lord. The issue in Runa Begum on the other hand, was whether the accommodation offered was suitable in our submission. That contrast not only with the situation in Tsfayo, whether it was good cause for delay in making the claim, um, but contrast with the present situation and the Lady Hale raised earlier the question of the various factual issues that might arise under the Housing Act. One of those, of course, is whether there's good cause for making an application out of time for the review procedure. In our submission that's very close to the Tsfayo situation would be extraordinary, say the least, if Tsfayo was not to apply to that sort of issue when it arose in the homelessness context as well as the housing benefit context, our submission that simply reinforces true distinction is between the nature of the decision, a decision under consideration and what was an issue, not the separate scheme, and that in our case, the point is even stronger than would delay.

p2,00:03:58.710,00:07:53.970,spk_0,"The case concerned the Army board, which was held not to constitute an independent, impartial tribunal for Article 6 (1) purposes when dealing with assessing compensation payable to a member of the territorial Army who brought a redundancy complaint. And this is a case in which the court concluded that an application for judicial review by the individual concerned did have sufficiency of review to remedy the lack of independence this is the reasoning by which the court came to that conclusion, in that particular case, that is instructive. And there's certainly that there are no suggestion in Crompton, that a key feature about Tsfayo is the council having been a judge in its own cause or the position of the decision having been made by members rather than officers. What one sees is that Tsfayo is again and again treated as being of wider importance in its particular factual context. Paragraph 50 on page seven of the decision, under the heading D towards the bottom of the page, the scope of judicial review of administrative decision making. The court observes that the scope of judicial review in administrative decision making in the United Kingdom is set out in the court judgement in Tsfayo. Then, turning to the law and halfway down page 8, the applicability of Article six of the proceedings, the government accepted that the African civil rights were determined in the domestic proceedings and Article six was applicable. So this is an authority on the sufficiency of review element, and the court's assessment is from towards the bottom of page 11, that will be the court's assessment and then roman one general principles. Beginning with paragraph 40 The court recalls that even where an adjudicatory body, determining disputes over civil rights and obligations does not comply with Article 6(1) in some respect, no violation of the convention can be found if the proceedings before that body are subject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and does provide the guarantees of Article 6(1). So the question is always whether there is or is not full jurisdiction. Paragraph 71, the court has previously held that in order to determine whether the Article six compliant second tier tribunal had full jurisdiction or provided sufficiency of review to remedy a lack of independence, of first instance, it was necessary to have regard to such factors as the subject matter of the decision appealed against, the manner in which that decision was arrived at and the contents of the dispute, including the desired and actual ground of appeal. See Bryan and Tsfayo. In Bryan, the court found it reasonable that the jurisdiction of the High Court to review findings of fact made at first instance, be limited to considering whether the findings of facts or the inferences based on them were perverse or unreasonable. It reached that conclusion in light of the specialised area of law, an issue in the dispute and the expertise of the inspector in establishing the facts and exercising discretion on a wide range of policy matters accordingly, judicial review in that case offered sufficiency of review and the proceedings, complied with Article 6(1). The convention organs followed the approach set out in Bryan to find"
p2,00:07:53.980,00:07:54.940,spk_1,judicial review did
p2,00:07:54.940,00:10:29.780,spk_0,"provide sufficiency of review in a number of cases against the United Kingdom, and they're then mentioned, including the Stefan and Kingsley cases, so one sees that Bryan is explained by reference to specialised area of law and expertise of the inspector in relevant respect in Paragraph 73. However, in Tsfayo, the court reached a different conclusion, concluding that the decision-making process was significantly different from previous cases. Whereas in Bryan, the issue, to be determined required a measure of professional knowledge or experience and the exercise of administrative discretion pursuant to wider policy aims. In Tsfayo, the board was deciding a simple question of fact, namely, whether there was good cause the applicants delay in making a benefit claim. On this question, the applicant have given evidence to the board, at the first she knew that anything was amiss, that her claim was when she received a notice from her housing association landlord to repossess because the rent was in arrears. The board found her explanation to be unconvincing and rejected her claim for back payment of benefit essentially on the basis of their assessment of her credibility. No specialist expertise was required to determine this issue, nor could the factual findings in Tsfayo be said to be merely incidental to the reaching broader judgments of policy or expediency, which it was for the democratically accountable authority to take. Accordingly, the court concluded that judicial review proceedings did not offer, in the circumstances raised in Tsfayo sufficiency of review in light of the fact that the High court had no jurisdiction to re-hear the evidence or substitute its own views as to the applicant's credibility. As a result, the central issue in the dispute was not determined by an independent and impartial tribunal. So one sees there that Tsfayo is characterised as concerning a simple question of fact, based on an assessment of credibility, not requiring specialist expertise and not incidental to the reaching of broader judgments of policy or expediency. And then the court goes on to the application of the general principles to the facts of the case. And one sees at paragraph 77 that the court considers that there is a legitimate concern that the Army board lacked the necessary structural independence."

p2,00:10:31.230,00:10:32.930,spk_1,Tsfayo. Yes. In
p2,00:10:32.930,00:10:34.440,spk_2,summarising or --
p2,00:10:34.780,00:10:35.660,spk_1,Tsfayo
p2,00:10:36.140,00:10:36.790,spk_2,the court
p2,00:10:36.790,00:10:41.560,spk_1,"in this case, leaves out paragraph 47 for some reason, it just skips it."
p2,00:10:42.080,00:10:42.490,spk_2,Well it
p2,00:10:42.500,00:10:44.260,spk_1,skips 47 Tsfayo.
p2,00:10:44.440,00:11:27.290,spk_0,"But they certainly leave out 47 in dealing with the, potential relevance of Tsfayo in Crompton if not more generally, and it no doubt, is a feature that obviously it's not necessarily unique to Tsfayo and housing benefit review boards as they were, but which is a particular consideration, which was obviously not thought in Crompton to be of central importance for general purposes in the way that the other statements in Tsfayo were."
p2,00:11:28.940,00:11:36.760,spk_3,"So it goes back to Tsfayo a bit later on just on page 14, just towards the end of Paragraph 77."
p2,00:11:39.040,00:11:49.310,spk_1,"Yes, I mean you can get around it if the sufficiency of -- sorry are you still searching?"
p2,00:11:49.580,00:11:50.700,spk_0,I have it here. Yes
p2,00:11:50.700,00:11:54.140,spk_1,you got it. Yeah.
p2,00:11:54.740,00:12:39.950,spk_0,"So my Lord, that's treated in Crompton as being something that is relevant in relation to Tsfayo itself, but not relevant in relation to Tsfayo's more general applicability. And, therefore, indicates that one shouldn't take paragraph 47 as being even an alternative, well certainly not as being"
p2,00:12:40.940,00:12:41.450,spk_2,crucial
p2,00:12:41.450,00:12:42.760,spk_0,to the decision in Tsfayo.
p2,00:12:43.640,00:12:59.860,spk_1,What are the general principles that form the subject matter of the head note just above paragraph 74. Is it just simply that you determine whether the -- what they say is the subject matter of the decision appealed against is a simple
p2,00:13:00.440,00:13:02.880,spk_0,question of fact on the one hand
p2,00:13:02.890,00:13:03.660,spk_1,or something
p2,00:13:03.660,00:14:16.050,spk_0,"requiring specialist expertise on the other. If it, involves policy or expediency, discretion, democratic accountability, any of those features and in particular, if it requires expertise and any factual disputes, if there are any, are merely incidental, then, those decisions are on one side of the line, including as in Tsfayo itself, or if an issue arose under subsection three of Section 202 of the homelessness provision, a question of whether or not it's good cause for extending tending time. That's one side, the other side is the case where if there are any factual matters at all, they are merely incidental, and where the essential decisions are matters that do involve expertise, policy or whatever."
p2,00:14:16.440,00:14:43.060,spk_1,"Because I'm just wondering, going back to paragraph 45 in Tsfayo, you remember this is a paragraph where, there's a comment on Runa Begum, and just about halfway down there's a quotation, the phrase only staging posts on the way to much broader judgments. Have we lost that? Or does that still form part of the inquiry as to whether or not one's dealing with a civil right?"
p2,00:14:44.940,00:14:45.680,spk_0,
p2,00:14:46.440,00:15:11.100,spk_1,"Sorry, while I need, sorry, that's the sufficiency of the review. I mean, is it -- can one divorce the question from the context, otherwise, I may have a good deal of satellite dispute as to whether or not something the expert is looking at is just a simple issue of fact before he gets to his -- the real kernel of what he's deciding or whether one can actually take account of the totality of the exercise."
p2,00:15:11.110,00:15:40.580,spk_0,"Yes. Well, as Baroness Hale was saying this morning, essentially, what is being done in paragraph 45 is to describe Runa Begum before going on in 46 to say what Strasbourg Court in Tsfayo is saying for itself. And the reference to staging posts in paragraph 45 is not carried over in Tsfayo, save the last sentence of paragraph 46."
p2,00:15:40.580,00:15:43.480,spk_1,That's because it didn't need to in Tsfayo.
p2,00:15:43.880,00:15:55.270,spk_0,"Nor can the --unlike the cases referred to the factual finding in the present case be said to be merely incidental to the reaching of broader judgments and so forth, which"
p2,00:15:55.270,00:15:57.060,spk_3,is picked up again in Crompton.
p2,00:15:57.740,00:15:58.750,spk_0,Yes.
p2,00:15:58.760,00:16:01.460,spk_3,Line four on page 13.
p2,00:16:02.440,00:16:24.680,spk_0,"Yes, so whether one describes it in terms of incidental to the reaching of broader judgments or describes it as a staging post, no doubt it's the same concept just expressed differently. And that is therefore, part of the test."
p2,00:16:24.690,00:16:25.150,spk_1,Thank you.
p2,00:16:27.140,00:16:41.480,spk_4,"It does look as if the factor which appears to have weighed most heavily in Crompton in reaching the decision that they did, which was that the judicial review was sufficient in this particular case, was the nature of the dispute."
p2,00:16:41.600,00:16:42.160,spk_0,Yes.
p2,00:16:43.240,00:17:23.260,spk_4,"Because the dispute was about the basis of compensation. And as the High Court had been able to investigate, how reasonable that was and formed views on it, and they'd also been able to look at the factual dispute about the length of service or something. Then, in the circumstances, it was all right. Yes. This is presenting us with a very difficult question, isn't it? Because supposing that there had been a head- on clash of credibility on some point that was necessary for the decision of the case. What would they have done?"
p2,00:17:23.449,00:17:25.560,spk_0,"Gone the other way, in our submission."
p2,00:17:26.040,00:17:27.870,spk_4,Rather sounds as if they might have done.
p2,00:17:28.670,00:17:32.360,spk_0,It is instructive to look at the application of the general principles.
p2,00:17:32.740,00:17:33.780,spk_4,"Well, that's what I was doing."
p2,00:17:33.790,00:17:58.550,spk_0,"To the facts as Your Ladyship has been doing. In Paragraph 77, they say that the court considers that the legitimate concern that the Army Board lack the necessary structural independence in assessing the level of compensations. However, it's not always the case that such circumstances will give rise to a violation. The Army Board had responsibility in the main for making findings of fact, had a"
p2,00:17:58.550,00:17:59.250,spk_2,large degree of
p2,00:17:59.260,00:18:40.860,spk_0,"discretion as to the level of compensation and so forth. However, unlike the cases of Bryan and X, the exercise of that discretion did not benefit from any specialist knowledge offered by the members of the tribunal in question. Accordingly, there was no compelling reason for the decision on the level of compensation to be made by the Army board rather than by an independent and impartial tribunal. In this respect, therefore, the court considers that the circumstances are similar to those in Tsfayo. There will therefore be a breach of Article six unless in the particular circumstances of the case, the judicial review proceedings offered sufficiency of review. On this question, the court notes that, unlike in society,"
p2,00:18:41.520,00:18:41.640,spk_3,the
p2,00:18:41.640,00:18:54.620,spk_0,"dispute between the parties in the present application did not centre on a question of fact determined by the Army board, which the high court had no jurisdiction to revisit. That in our submission is the crucial sentence,"
p2,00:18:54.630,00:18:59.770,spk_1,"And so that's picking up what we saw in Paragraph 71, third last line."
p2,00:19:00.540,00:19:00.880,spk_0,Yes. The
p2,00:19:00.890,00:19:02.100,spk_1,content of the dispute.
p2,00:19:02.100,00:19:02.950,spk_0,Content of the dispute.
p2,00:19:03.200,00:19:04.130,spk_1,Yes. As
p2,00:19:04.130,00:21:05.730,spk_0,"one of the three elements set out in Bryan and then this is developed. The central issue was whether the approach to the Army board in assessing that the level of the compensation was appropriate. The court considers it significant that the High Court examined in some detail how the Army board had arrived at the figure offered. It's clear that the African precedent was carefully examined by the court, which reached its decision following an analysis of the approach of the Army board and an assessment of whether or not that approach was reasonable in the circumstances. As regards the applicants first criticism concerning the exercise of the Army board's discretion in calculating the award on the basis of a six year cut off date, the High Court was able to review all the relevant factors relating to the decision of the board and to assess whether the approach taken was appropriate. Criticism was rejected on the grounds the board had acted entirely properly in selecting a six year cut off date, the calculation. In respect of the second criticism regarding the salary base used for the calculation of the award, the court observes that in so far as it was a factual dispute between the parties, as to the applicant's salary at the time of the redundancy, the question of fact was in the event revisited, the High Court had regard to papers supporting the argument that an incorrect salary base had been used and concluded that further investigation was required, it was reviewed and an increased offer of compensation. Applicant does not dispute that the revised salary base used was correct and then, having regard to the relevant factors as outlined in Tsfayo, the court concludes that the High Court on Judicial review did have sufficiency of review to remedy any lack of independence of the Army board. Although the high court could not substitute its own view to an appropriate award, it could and did examine both the method of calculation and the base figures used for the calculation and so forth. The applicant's complaint was therefore determined by an independent and impartial tribunal, so no violations."
p2,00:21:05.860,00:21:06.470,spk_2,So
p2,00:21:06.470,00:21:14.730,spk_1,"in that paragraph, they're looking -- going back to paragraph 71, they're looking at the desired and actual grounds of appeal, which are taking you into that kind of territory. Yes."
p2,00:21:15.840,00:21:35.530,spk_0,"So what is the issue? And if the issue as here, that the parties are raising before the court, the county court, is a an issue of primary fact, an issue turning on credibility."
p2,00:21:35.560,00:21:36.120,spk_4,Then
p2,00:21:36.120,00:21:39.360,spk_0,"in our submission, both Tsfayo and Crompton support"
p2,00:21:39.840,00:21:40.110,spk_2,that
p2,00:21:40.110,00:21:47.740,spk_0,that must be dealt with by a court that will consider the merits. And it's not sufficient for that to be dealt with in the judicial
p2,00:21:47.740,00:21:48.450,spk_2,review
p2,00:21:48.940,00:22:08.860,spk_0,"way. That would be appropriate in a Runa Begum type case concerned with a question of suitability or a planning case like Alconbury very concerned with policy, even political, sometimes issues, and that that is the distinction which is being made."
p2,00:22:08.940,00:22:35.680,spk_3,"But I must begin to think, really, almost the only issue which you are contending for, or of course, you need to contend for in the present case are whether this letter has been received, which is a precondition of really an almost discreet question on an issue which equally could arise under Section 202 as to whether -- that the authority were entitled to deny you a late review. Yes."
p2,00:22:36.380,00:22:36.650,spk_0,Which
p2,00:22:36.650,00:22:38.180,spk_3,is the one akin to the other case. Indeed.
p2,00:22:40.270,00:23:24.130,spk_1,"Does one gets some help going back to Tsfayo if I'm right at Page 470, at the end of Paragraph 43 where there's a quotation from Bryan, which is really the beginning of this line of jurisprudence, which is showing what is said to be a typical example of the exercise of discretionary judgement in the regulation of citizens conduct and so on in the sphere of planning. So you would say, well, that's fine, you can -- there's a sort of a class of decisions which come for within that broad umbrella, but this wouldn't be that kind of decision and the area of dispute identified by the grounds of appeal don't enlarge it into that area either you would"
p2,00:23:24.130,00:23:38.030,spk_0,"say. Well, that's exactly it. My Lord, the -- as I mentioned briefly, almost at the outset this morning, the Court"
p2,00:23:38.030,00:23:39.230,spk_1,of Appeal was impressed
p2,00:23:39.240,00:26:14.430,spk_0,"by practical considerations. Obviously, the primary point is that practical considerations ultimately can't prevail over what the law requires. But in our submission, in any event, the practical considerations or the practical difficulties that are alleged are at best exaggerated. Lord, there are no doubt a spectrum of situations, at one end of the spectrum are cases involving policies and political decisions or the exercise of discretion. Cases such as Alconbury areas for the exercise of expertise and subject to democratic accountability, where the role of the courts is appropriately limited to light touch, judicial review or an appeal on like principles. At the other end of the spectrum are cases like the present, involving no more and no less than a dispute of primary fact, questions of policy of discretion of democratic accountability do not come into it. And on the contrary, we say resolving disputed issues of fact and assessing the credibility of witnesses is par excellence, for the expertise of judges in the middle, are the cases involving a mixture of the elements. And if then, the dispute is predominantly not about factual -- is not about fact-finding, and the factual findings are not discrete. Then the case will be treated in accordance with its predominant characteristic, even though, incidentally, there may be some issues of fact to be resolved on the way, Lord, in our submission, that's a perfectly coherent scheme in principle and no more difficult to apply in practise than many distinctions are made, distinguishing between on the one hand, primary finding of fact cases and, on the other hand, cases where either finding the fact don't arise at all, or if they do, they're just ancillary or incidental or staging post findings of fact. A distinction one which Judge Macduff QC as he then was in Ali in our submission, rightly recognised that there's a distinction perfectly capable of being made, and in our submission, it doesn't give rise to any undue practical difficulties. The simple question of categorisation one asked oneself the question, is the case essentially a dispute about what the primary facts"
p2,00:26:14.430,00:26:15.670,spk_2,are? Or
p2,00:26:15.670,00:26:19.660,spk_0,is it about something much broader to which any factual issues are subordinate?
p2,00:26:20.650,00:27:22.280,spk_4,"I'm sitting in the Shoreditch County Court and I'm thinking, I've got a section 204 appeal and I now have to look at the essence of the dispute and asked myself, well is it predominantly one of fact and credibility? Or is it predominantly one of -- where does suitability go? Because there may be all sorts of bits and pieces in that, but it's essentially a question of fact. The fact that involves expert evaluation, so to speak. It's an unrealistic situation that you've got the distinction between questions of law, the distinction between judicial review type grounds and the rest full merits review, determination of disputed issues of fact. That is something we all understand, we've brought up on it, we can do. This is sounding very, very tricky indeed. When is it a pure issue of fact? Simple fact, not difficult fact. I can do the simple facts, but I can't do the difficult facts."
p2,00:27:23.070,00:27:23.660,spk_2,Well.
p2,00:27:25.130,00:27:32.410,spk_4,"This isn't necessarily an argument against you, Mr Goudie, it's just I'm trying to imagine myself back into the Shorditch County"
p2,00:27:32.410,00:27:38.260,spk_0,Court. It may be that the description simple
p2,00:27:38.640,00:27:39.170,spk_4,
p2,00:27:40.240,00:28:47.450,spk_0,"dispute of fact, as distinct from dispute of fact, is not very illuminating because questions of credibility of witnesses, of course, may be very difficult to resolve, if the witnesses on both sides either both appear to be truthful or more commonly, both appear to be untruthful. How do we decide what your decision is going to be? Now that is bread and butter for judges and recorders and others in the Shoreditch County Court. The -- as to how a judge is going to approach the matter, in our submission, essentially, he approached the appeal in the way he or she would approach any other appeal. Then you look at the grounds of appeal, and it may be quite clear, just looking at the ground of appeal, that the appeal is not about a matter of fact at all. It may, on the other hand, be totally clear from the grounds of appeal that the only issue that is raised is a dispute of fact. So there are going to be some cases, which the answer is going to be straightforward."
p2,00:28:47.940,00:28:48.210,spk_2,Of
p2,00:28:48.210,00:29:11.350,spk_0,"course, as with any distinction, there may be grey area cases, there may be cases which it's not immediately apparent whether the issue is to be regarded as one of fact, or as one requiring expertise. Or it may not be -- there may be elements of both."
p2,00:29:12.140,00:29:12.400,spk_4,What's --
p2,00:29:12.400,00:29:13.860,spk_1,I'm lost.
p2,00:29:13.870,00:29:15.080,spk_0,Well we have the benefit.
p2,00:29:15.090,00:29:25.360,spk_1,"Can I just put the point to you, sorry I'm interrupting, but it's -- Section 204 tells me if I'm sitting there, that my jurisdiction is limited to determining a point of"
p2,00:29:25.360,00:29:26.270,spk_0,law. Yes.
p2,00:29:26.720,00:29:43.950,spk_1,"Right, there we are, we understand what that means. Yes. But assume that we've got over the hurdle of identifying an issue as a simple issue of fact, what am I to do? That's not an issue of law. Do I decline jurisdiction? Do I send it somewhere else? Or do I follow the reasoning in Adan?"
p2,00:29:43.950,00:29:44.430,spk_2,Or what?
p2,00:29:45.120,00:30:33.490,spk_0,"My primary submission is that one follows the reasoning in Adan. If that doesn't work, then one's into a section for declaration of incompatibility situation. Because one is arguing, of course, that where the statute says appeal on point of law, um, that in order to achieve convention compatibility, that should include an appeal on point of fact, and that the judge should, in the appropriate case, hear witnesses, have cross-examination, make his own or her own findings in relation to credibility and in relation to whether a letter for example, was received or not whether there was good cause for extending time, or not."
p2,00:30:33.500,00:31:00.560,spk_3,"Just help me on that last point, this extending of time. I mean, how does it work? I see under 202(3), there it is. It's for the authority in writing to decide whether they allow longer. I mean, I don't know if there's ever been one of these cases. I mean, does -- somebody writes from the council saying, terribly sorry, we don't think -- we think it's too late, you can't. How do you challenge that?"
p2,00:31:01.140,00:31:11.560,spk_0,"Well, that would be a judicial review challenge. Although the authority as the primary decision-maker, the decision is on normal principles subject to."
p2,00:31:11.570,00:31:12.260,spk_3,So that's straight JR is it?
p2,00:31:12.810,00:31:14.270,spk_0,That.
p2,00:31:15.140,00:31:16.550,spk_3,Have we ever had such a case?

p2,00:31:57.870,00:31:59.050,spk_0,else?
p2,00:31:59.050,00:32:37.000,spk_3,"Can you seek to isolate that and say that, there it is, that's a perfectly straightforward issue of fact, issue of credibility, no expertise. And the County Court judge can say all right, on a review, well, I'm prepared to hear evidence on that, somehow stretching his jurisdiction and point of law. But obviously, if you lose on that and then we're into suitability, which is the other basic ground of review, well, then there it is. It's straight looking at the facts as found by the authorities."
p2,00:32:37.540,00:32:39.120,spk_0,"Yes, that"
p2,00:32:39.130,00:32:43.680,spk_2,one would

If it found that the letter had been"

p2,00:33:17.540,00:33:27.780,spk_0,Well then you're into suitability.  Then the decision on suitability would be a matter for the authority and the court would approach that issue only on a judicial review basis.
p2,00:33:27.790,00:33:34.740,spk_1,What's the policy here? Because you seem to be saying that it's only in easy cases that the individual has these rights once

The distinction is not between easy and difficult. The distinction is between decisions that are peculiarly appropriate for judicial expertise, credibility issues, the finding of facts on the one hand and issues on the other hand, which are issues primarily for administrators because they require a particular kind of specialist expertise, which judges in general and certainly by virtue of being judges lack, but which administrators, having regard to their experience, have."
p2,00:34:40.800,00:35:26.260,spk_4,"But some questions of suitability, it's so difficult, isn't it? Miss Ali may have got herself -- her facts wrong because she was confusing the two different offers that she'd got within weeks of one another. But the reason that she gave for turning down, the offer -- the homelessness offer was that this was a flat somewhere up on a tower block, and there wasn't a lift and she had two young Children. Now that's not an expertise issue, that's a simple issue as to whether it is suitable for this woman in her circumstances with her children to have to go to a particular sort of accommodation, which does or does not have a lift."
p2,00:35:26.640,00:37:04.380,spk_0,"But it's an expertise issue in in two senses. First of all, the question of whether or not something is, an expertise issue or not looked at from the perspective of the judge Shoreditch County Court, is that yes, suitability as an expertise issue because the House of Lords and Runa Begum and has said that suitability, is an issue of that kind. But secondly, it is indeed an expertise issue because the person who is judging whether or not  it has been reasonable to refuse an offer or to put it another way, whether the accommodation is suitable or not, is taking account not only of the particular circumstances of the particular family, but also in that respect of the general housing situation in the neighbourhood. What resources are available? What other claims there are by other families made on it the size of the waiting list? How many other homeless families there are, how many properties there are that are not in tower blocks and all that which may not -- expertise may not be quite the right word, but it is certainly expert knowledge which the housing officer will have and which even an experienced County Court judge, will not have save anecdotally from previous cases that they tried. It was not the first one."

Not, perhaps as conspicuously an issue of fact as whether a letter has been received or not, but an issue of fact, nonetheless, as to whether there is a probability on the evidence, of domestic violence again, it's an issue of the thought that judges are well equipped to resolve and which does not require knowledge of local housing circumstances in order to be able to resolve it. But that's not to say that one may not find an instance where one could put arguments either way as to which side of the line a particular provision fell. But a line has to be drawn and in our submission, were very clearly on the right side of it, and that therefore, a result could be achieved by which that -- results should be fashioned by which that may be achieved, and that the real issue is whether that can, given the language of Section 204 be arrived at by reference to Section three of the Human Rights Act in the Adan way or whether it has to be by way of a declaration of incompatibility. We commend the Adan approach and the Section three route, but it's perhaps necessary for me to take that point further at this stage, given that you're going to hear conflicting arguments from the other parties in relation to that custom."

The important point for us is that we act fairly in our administration, and for that reason and doubtless because she'll do a better job of it than I, I'm not going to make any submissions on issue one. Therefore, we're going to move directly to issue two pretty much on the Runa Begum basis that we're assuming a breach of civil right. Although we would share the view of Lord Walker in Runa Begum and Lady Hale in Croydon, that it is very much at the edge. I think the Lordship went a little further than that, since I'm not going to make submissions, oviously I wont. Can I identify our summary contentions in opening? We say that the cases both domestic and European, are clear.

Have an appeal on a point of fact, in some individual cases, this is the practicalities. This is the Runa Begum approach and if it's correct and remains correct, then clearly it disposes the case, and of course, that is our principal submission. Runa Begum was not doubted in Tsfayo.

But it does describe the role of the Army Board as, a very fact-based, usually. But such a broad jurisdiction is weak on point A in Bryan, that is to say, the scheme. The natural subject matter could be simply anything, unlimited jurisdiction on a particular non-independent body. It could not be saved in every case by the Anderson safeguards, the judicial review procedure. But it could be saved in a particular case where the dispute was not one of pure fact, weighing up again, weighing up the broadly three Bryan features. And neither of these cases, therefore, suggests that a different result will be reached by Strasbourg, in the present case. The balance of considerations when you take all three elements into account remains against the need -- any need for a fact-based appeal or review. Obviously, my final point is that if we lose on all that, then we go to compatibility."

For example, where another convention writers engaged, article three could be engaged, in some cases, a judicial review approach is invariably sufficient, whatever the individual points of fact arising, that is to say, the nature of the scheme, its subject matter, it's protections means that judicial review is a sufficient safeguard in every case."

He refers to the triangulation of interests and you've got the accused, you've got victim, and society. Do we get any hint in Bryan or any of these cases since that the Strasbourg court is seeing that there's a triangulation of interests here which may affect the way in which one determines whether an issue really is an issue of fact or is something brought up as a sort of web -- part of the web of the scheme itself?"
p2,01:10:19.890,01:10:38.790,spk_2,"Well, it may be said to be embedded in the proposition that Strasburg has accepted, that something less than a full trial is accepted -- is acceptable in areas of administrative decision making. We would say that that was surely, unless I misunderstand your Lordship, implicit in that."

And of course, it is the passage that says furthermore, even if, which makes the point that in Bryan, even if it had been a question of fact, it would have made no difference.

Yet to have the question of whether a letter had been received gave the course of judicial inquiry, seems to us, not merely impracticable but disproportionate.

And the want of proportionality is exacerbated in the present cases on their own facts bearing in mind that we're dealing with discharge of a single application as homeless in each case assistant, several serial homelessness. So Ms Ali didn't know there was a one offer policy."

The point I made was that Ms Ali knew that there was a one offer policy because it was notified in the original decision letter. So from the off, she knew there was a one offer only policy."
p2,01:15:25.480,01:15:27.430,spk_4,That's the letter of the seventh of November?

p2,01:15:36.640,01:16:00.060,spk_2,"Yes, I think that is, nonetheless, whatever the technicality is, I'm seeking to show that there are other considerations which lower the impact of what might otherwise be a fairly egregious speech because we never tell you that this may be it, and that's it."
p2,01:16:01.430,01:16:07.400,spk_3,"Sorry, so you mean that the outcome of this appeal could turn on the fact that she got an earlier letter which did tell her?"
p2,01:16:08.430,01:16:30.570,spk_2,"No, the outcome of this appeal will turn on the way it's been argued? All I'm saying is that it would be disproportionate in these cases, in these cases, generally and specifically to have to have trials.

p2,01:16:30.580,01:16:44.770,spk_3,"I meant no, I meant the appeal to this court. I don't understand the relevance of this particular lady, having on an earlier occasion, received a letter such as she disputes, having received in respect."
p2,01:16:44.770,01:17:12.650,spk_2,"I'm arguing that the proportionality, the proportionality is relevant to whether or not a full fact review is called for in a particular case, I'm saying that all she is saying is that she didn't actually get this one letter, but she can't say she didn't know about the policy."

p2,01:17:39.590,01:18:07.930,spk_2,"That's it, exclusively. But it is not a dispute with any substance because she all along knew that it was a one offer only policy and from a previous occasion, knew that when an offer was made, it would discharge the authority's duty. That was the point I was making. I don't want to dwell on it. I'm just making that point that that is what we are talking about."

Which is a huge issue of fact, which nobody is arguing. At least I don't think he's arguing, ought to be, well maybe he doesn't have to argue it. I'm not entirely sure what he is arguing, but certainly that maybe within the area, that's a huge issue of fact. That may be excluded."

p2,01:18:39.730,01:18:56.570,spk_4,"Yeah, but it may be excluded. Whereas this is a comparatively small issue of fact, comparatively easy to resolve. It's a sledgehammer for it to have to go to court. I think that's the point you're making, it's something like that."
p2,01:18:56.580,01:19:01.040,spk_2,"Yes it is, it is, I call that proportionality, but I'm certainly happy with sledgehammer and that."
p2,01:19:02.120,01:19:21.820,spk_3,"But would you accept Mr Arden, that actually, nobody has ever heard this particular lady's case as to why it was wrong to conclude she had reached -- she'd received the letter based on her admission on the telephone when actually, she hasn't had a chance to tell anybody, that she didn't, that she wasn't [crosstalk]."

p2,01:19:47.420,01:19:48.130,spk_3,Yeah.
p2,01:19:50.340,01:20:06.800,spk_2,"She explained she received two offers, she was asked whether I received the offer letter, and I believed it was Teviot Tower therefore replied, I'd received it, and as the conversation progressed, I became aware that I was being questioned about why I had refused Erdington."
p2,01:20:07.410,01:20:07.630,spk_1,I
p2,01:20:07.630,01:20:52.860,spk_2,"informed the caller this was a number of reasons, including this fact and that fact. I also meant to explain to the caller that what I had -- that when I had said I received the offer letter. I was referring to a letter I had receive in respect of Teviot Tower. So she did, in fact, have the opportunity, your Lordships interview, saying she never had the opportunity, she had the opportunity. She was -- I've just said your Lordship, that under Mohamed v Hammersmith Lord Slynn's case which I think your Lordship was therefore familiar with, it is an inquiry that's made by the reviewing officer, if he doesn't make sufficient enquiries, he can be challenged on that basis as always."

p2,01:20:53.670,01:21:23.190,spk_2,"reviewing officer can be challenged in the county court for making insufficient inquiries. He can be challenged for mistaking an established fact. But the public law is fairly clear that when he's not told something put in brackets, which the applicant could have told him, then he's not to be faulted for it."
p2,01:21:23.280,01:21:37.040,spk_1,But the way it's put at Page 126 going back to Arlene Daniels's letter is that the conversation really was diverted from receipt of the letter to the suitability of the accommodation
p2,01:21:37.330,01:21:37.950,spk_2,Because that was the real issue.
p2,01:21:39.190,01:22:01.450,spk_1,"She seems to have said, well, actually, you advise you to receive the letter and refused the offer for a number of other reasons, and then we go into absence of lifts and so on and so forth and having looked at all those reasons, this being the area of dispute, apparently, in the conversation, the review officer decides that the duty has been fulfilled."
p2,01:22:01.550,01:22:52.290,spk_2,"The review officer's not to be faulted for not addressing something he wasn't told that he could have been told. Now, if Ms Ali said I didn't understand anything about that, I never understood that it was a different letter, then it may be that we'd be in the area of representations being made and being asked for the officer to reconsider, because at least, hopefully, there's no law of sort of functus officio operating here. It is routinely the case that when further submissions are put in, they will be looked at to see if they make a difference, routinely. And indeed it quite difficult to operate"
p2,01:22:52.550,01:22:52.710,spk_1,the
p2,01:22:52.720,01:23:29.140,spk_2,"protocol. Were it not the case because one always has to consider the other side's case beforehand and so on. But here is a case where she did understand and by implication, forgot or what have you. I'm sorry, forgot sounds pejorative, and I don't mean to be, these conversations aren't easy, and I appreciate that, nonetheless, the real area was the suitability. That's what she addressed. She chose to address that, not the fact that she says she didn't have the letter."
p2,01:23:30.600,01:24:04.110,spk_1,"How does this system that was described at page 112 work? I'm looking at the letter she got -- sorry the letter that was suggested she got, which is in dispute. But let's assume that somebody reads this letter and it says we have to offer you accommodation only once. It's a quarter the way down, this is your one and final offer and yet in this conversation, the reviewing officer gets into a discussion of suitability."
p2,01:24:04.120,01:24:10.040,spk_2,Because that is the whole point at the bottom of 112 if you turned this offer down without good reason.
p2,01:24:10.040,01:24:11.150,spk_1,Right I see. I
p2,01:24:11.150,01:24:14.560,spk_2,"hope it is the case, forgive me, [crosstalk]."

p2,01:24:15.430,01:24:18.380,spk_2,authority. Yes. You ask what the reasons are.
p2,01:24:18.390,01:24:24.970,spk_1,Yes. So this really turned into a conversation about the good reason rather than the the receipt of the letter.
p2,01:24:24.980,01:24:37.020,spk_2,"It may be that, you know, in some cases, you know, some authorities particularly that is familiar with this case now, they will say you did get that letter, didn't you?"
p2,01:24:37.870,01:24:49.530,spk_3,"I mean, if you -- if the letter had omitted, of course, it didn't, but if the letter omitted this business about if you turn down this offer without a good reason, we won't offer you anymore accommodation, then it doesn't,"
p2,01:24:49.850,01:24:50.180,spk_4,It
p2,01:24:50.190,01:24:55.400,spk_3,"doesn't operate that way. I mean, that's the effect, as I understand it of section 1935."
p2,01:24:55.410,01:24:57.960,spk_2,"That would be a straight point of law. No,"
p2,01:24:57.960,01:25:02.960,spk_3,"no, of course. Of course. Now I appreciate that I mean, but that sentence is absolutely critical for"
p2,01:25:02.960,01:25:27.420,spk_2,"the. Yeah. It's a point of law if it was omitted but it has not been admitted it, it's in there. Yes. We ring up, we discussed with her her reasons for refusal. She's been through this process before, she's been told about the one offer only policy, and indeed, she even --we discussed the offer letter with her."
p2,01:25:27.990,01:25:28.860,spk_1,Yeah.
p2,01:25:28.940,01:25:56.660,spk_2,"And it's only -- she forgets to tell us that she was confused about which offer letter it was. My learned friend, can I just deal quite as an aside, just with one thing that may be confusing your Lordships, your Ladyship, probably not. Certainly confused me for a long time, because the facts start with Ali and then go to Ibrahim. And it's Ibrahim, which had the two letters in one envelope."
p2,01:25:56.670,01:25:57.400,spk_1,But
p2,01:25:57.400,01:26:05.730,spk_2,"actually, that was before Ali and the authority did change their procedures as a result of the county court judge's observations."
p2,01:26:05.740,01:26:09.280,spk_1,"Yes, Ibrahim was October 2005."
p2,01:26:09.290,01:26:20.590,spk_2,"Yes, I'm grateful, but they did change their procedure. I just want to, wanted to make sure that that was clear."

p2,01:26:28.480,01:26:38.710,spk_2,"I think the point I was making is the more technical it is, or the less substance there is, the more disproportionate it is to think of going to a court to have a trial on it."
p2,01:26:39.380,01:27:05.320,spk_5,"Can I ask you a question about that? Because I'm having some difficulty in understanding how proportionality fits into this argument. If one concentrates on the underlying purpose of examining the question of the sufficiency of the review, I take it that you would accept that the purpose of that review is to assess the capacity to remedy a lack of independence."
p2,01:27:08.980,01:27:23.090,spk_2,"No, I very much doubt it. It was to have an internal review because it was not to be decided exclusively on one officer. I don't think it's addressed in those terms, my Lord, it was pre-1998 Act."
p2,01:27:23.880,01:27:39.420,spk_5,"Yes, but I'm not talking about the jurisprudence of Strasbourg. No, no I understood. What is -- if it's not to examine the -- a capacity to remedy the perceived lack of independence, what is the purpose?"
p2,01:27:39.830,01:28:02.100,spk_2,"To correct any errors or misjudgements by the officer reaching the first decision. They could be [inaudible], nothing to do with want of independence, because the first officer has no greater either perceived or actual, want of independence than the second officer."

p2,01:28:23.420,01:28:54.550,spk_2,"my Lord, it's much more pragmatic than that, and as Lord Millett says quite correctly, it was a transfer, judicial review jurisdiction from the I can't remember whether it was already the administrative court or the Crown Office list, at that time to the county court because it was swamping it. It was the second largest user of judicial review, homelessness, and it was simply to transfer that jurisdiction, with respect, that, I think is a well known in the--"
p2,01:28:54.550,01:29:06.050,spk_5,"That may have been the motivation, but what is the underlying purpose? You say it's got nothing whatever to do with -- to redress the lack of independence?"
p2,01:29:06.670,01:29:11.890,spk_2,"Well, it is to subject the authority to the process of law as judicial review always does."
p2,01:29:12.270,01:29:15.050,spk_5,"Well, I'm sorry that doesn't convey anything to me, I'm afraid."
p2,01:29:15.410,01:29:34.180,spk_2,"I'm saying that it's a public authority, it is susceptible to law that in accordance with principals of judicial review. But if it was to address the want of independence, then my Lord, surely it would have been a jurisdiction to reach a new decision on the substance."
p2,01:29:35.870,01:29:38.890,spk_5,Well I'll consider your answer and may come back
p2,01:29:38.890,01:30:43.070,spk_4,"to it. This was all done before the Human Rights Act? We had a situation, didn't we? In which we got a standard sort of administrative procedure, go along to your local authority, you say I'm homeless, please put me up, local authority makes various decisions by an officer. It's very common in that sort of agency situation to have a review procedure, benefits had that throughout for the purpose of correcting errors, basically. Nothing to do with independence, because, as you rightly pointed out, they were both equally lacking in independence, as such. That doesn't mean to say they lacked impartiality, but they might have lacked independence. Of course, like any other administrative decision, they're subject to judicial review. There was, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr Arden, but there was a stage at which it was argued that the right to be housed as a homeless person actually gave rise to a right in private law because it was susceptible to an action for breach of statutory duty, if you were not housed. And those,"
p2,01:30:43.070,01:30:44.050,spk_2,"of course, please."
p2,01:30:44.050,01:30:44.950,spk_4,"Yes, exactly. [Crosstalk]"
p2,01:30:44.960,01:30:46.200,spk_2,by concession.
p2,01:30:46.210,01:31:15.670,spk_4,"Yes, but that all went. But I'm saying there was a stage at which it was thought that the whole thing could go to the county court as a breach of statutory duty, that was then knocked on the head. Cocks v Thanet. Yes. And so  judicial review then took off as a way of trying to find points of law to challenge the merits of local authority decision-making in this area. And the administrative court, as it then was, it was swamped, just as it is now swamped by a different sort of case."
p2,01:31:15.680,01:31:18.160,spk_2,"It was swamped by two, immigration and homelessness."
p2,01:31:19.940,01:31:35.940,spk_4,"And both in fact, asylum -- a tribunal was set up for asylum and the county court was given these cases, but on a strict judicial review basis. And all of that took place some time before the Human Rights Act."
p2,01:31:35.980,01:31:40.450,spk_2,Took place in 1996 with a government which wasn't contemplating

Paragraphs eight, I'd probably put this in for another point, but I don't want to have to come back to it, which would be the compatibility argument at the end, playing that the county court judge may not make fresh findings of fact. paragraph nine, your Lordships, your Ladyship should have been to usually and starting at 9(1), his context is not merely part seven, not merely homelessness, the administration of the important social field of housing. So there's a wide -- in which there's a wider public dimension. Of course, in the traditional conventional civil rights between parties in Europe, these would not have fit it because of the presence of the third party in every case, which is to say those affected by it."
p2,01:35:34.160,01:35:43.330,spk_1,"Any case involving the expenditure of public funds is going to be a wider public dimension, I'm not quite sure what he's driving at there."
p2,01:35:43.440,01:36:59.990,spk_2,"Well, he's saying, first of all, the context is one because this is the European context as analysed by Lord Hoffmann, which is the movement from decisions which are reached by administrative bodies to within the purview of Article Six. I think he's just setting that scene. The public dimension, it's perhaps realistic that housing benefit and other welfare benefits, although of course, in one sense, they make demands on the public purse, they're not capped or limited in any way unless they change the regulations, as my Lord, they are certainly doing so very shortly, but until they change the regulations, you are entitled to the amounts you're entitled to. In housing, there is much more give and take in terms of what's suitable in terms of what's reasonable to do with the actual size of the pot. I suspect that may have been in the back of his mind. Factual findings will only be staging posts on the way to broader judgments. We'll certainly hear, actually, it is only a staging post."

p2,01:39:27.240,01:39:29.250,spk_3,I'm just wondering whether

p3,00:03:03.660,00:06:09.840,spk_0,"as to be incapable of cure by judicial review. I reject the submission. Very essence of the right has been impaired. So the concept full jurisdiction accordingly requires the court take the decision of threshold remitted to some other body, fully independent, manifestly impartial. There is no such body at the moment.  What Lord Justice Ward is recognising here in our submission is something that's implicit in the European and domestic discussion of the administrative rather than judicial model of decision making and his spelling that out that it is an administrator's job not to do people out of their rights but to administer their distribution, actually, and at risk of sounding simplistic, trained local authority. Housing officers are, by and large, there to house people. There's no conscious or unconscious intention to approach applicants. Unfavourably to house people is their job, and if anything, one would expect housing officers to lean in favour of applicants. The authorities wider interest is to prevent homelessness, not to generate it. Nor is the spectre of member pressure to be assumed. We're not saying it can never happen. But the reason, if I if I may say this, perhaps a mild tendency in some cases for courts. I dare say this to bring their own experience of local government, to bear, whether drive from practise or otherwise or general knowledge or what have you sometimes without appreciating some of the considerable. Some of us would say seismic changes that have taken place in local government over the last decade or two. In particular. Members are now statutorily required to commit to a code of conduct which has to, and they are disqualified as members if they don't sign up to it after a period of time. The code of conduct has to contain provisions, some of which are mandatory and set by government by statutory instrument, one of which I thought it's worth. And breach of these provisions leads to sanctions not just committee within the authority, but to something called the case tribunal of the Independent adjudication panel for England and can lead again to disqualification as a member. This is all under the Local Government Act 2000, and the reason I mentioned that, if I may is just to finish that point, I confess, I did wonder on the way here whether we should actually have produced this obviously we will produce copies if, well, if its helpful"
p3,00:06:10.020,00:06:28.630,spk_3,"I haven't detected any indication in the argument or in the correspondents. We've seen that there was any attempt by officials sorry, by elected councillors to put pressure on officials. We are dealing with relatively, low level individual fact based decision,"

And one of these criteria. One of these conditions of the code is that members must not do anything which compromises or is likely to compromise the impartiality of those who work for or on behalf of the authority. Otherwise, that impartiality element. This doesn't follow the case. By the way, that impartiality element is embedded in the work of officers in modern local government law structure. That's what I wanted to bring out. It's not a casual or impressionistic thing. It's actually there. Going back to Croydon at 75 to 77 we have again the whole scheme approach leading to the point, Uh, at 77. We don't really need to read it out, but at 77 it's not enough to look at section 20 alone. The whole of part three is relevant at the end of the process. Is the decision as to what sort of accommodation within the wide range of section 23 is appropriate? Well, actually, that is the exercise that we're engaged in here. Uh. I'm going to go on, then to write the House of Lords very briefly, which is volume five [inaudible] 30. And it is The speech of Lady Baroness Hale at paragraph 23."
p3,00:08:35.530,00:08:48.080,spk_0,Perhaps I can back up into 22 halfway through it. I'm sorry. Have 30. And
p3,00:08:48.080,00:08:48.460,spk_2,it's
p3,00:08:49.040,00:08:50.290,spk_0,page 750.
p3,00:08:50.300,00:08:51.160,spk_3,"Yes,"
p3,00:08:52.240,00:10:10.350,spk_0,"Uh, and it was the passage that I think I referred to already. While the Transport, just above b in 22 has the luxury of looking back at particular circumstances decided whether there's been a breach our national law has to devise the scheme, which we generally applicable for the impact of the decision is name. As Lord Justice Dyson puts it in the Court of Appeal. The question whether Article 8 is engaged should not be decided by a case by case basis, but the actual effect. And then it's 23. The difficult question is how the requirements of Article 6 applies it is a well named principal. Decisions which determine civil rights and obligations may be made by administrative authorities provided the Zen access to the independent, impartial tribunal full jurisdiction. What amounts to full jurisdiction there is, according to the nature of the decision, does not always require access to the court. Even for the determination of disputed issues of fact much depends on the subject matter of the decision. The quality of the initial decision making process, the classic exercise of administrative discussion, even though determinative of civil rights complication a number of safeguards to ensure the procedure is in fact a fair and impartial judicial review maybe adequate, even though there's no jurisdiction to examine the facts of merits."
p3,00:10:13.050,00:10:26.630,spk_0,"And finally, of the domestic cases. I would go, if I may, to the draft speeches in Croydon, recognising what they are."

p3,00:10:50.250,00:10:51.310,spk_3,volume are we looking at?

p3,00:11:00.430,00:11:01.410,spk_3,"Yes, draft judgement."
p3,00:11:01.810,00:11:04.890,spk_4,we're all in a bit of trouble. If they change between now and Thursday. Aren't we?
p3,00:11:07.340,00:11:32.670,spk_0,"A little bit? But since I'm only going to refer to the speeches of my Lady and the report, the opinions though I won't make that mistake again. I did it immediately. Very briefly. Paragraph 36. This is in the speech of my Lady."
p3,00:11:36.440,00:11:36.950,spk_4,You've done it again. Sorry

p3,00:11:39.490,00:13:14.560,spk_0,"36. And the opinion of affected just refers to the proposition that the distinction between the civil rights, private, and public law has long been abandoned. The concept extended. But with that extension has gone some modification of what article 6 requires and at 44 to 45. Reluctant to accept, Article 6 requires the judicialization of claims to welfare services of this kind. Unlike the arguments based on statutory construction and jurisdictional fact, Mr Howell's argument cannot sensibly distinguish between determination of age and other criteria. Every decision about the provision of welfare services has resource implications for public authority. Public authorities exist to serve the public by reducing, raising and spending public money the officers make. The decisions cannot be regarded as impartial, and the problem cannot be cured by the ordinary processes of judicial review. Based upon the usual criteria of legality, fairness, reasonableness or rationality, tribunals will have to be set up to determine the merits of claims to children’s services and so on. Many more resources we might have spent on the services will be diverted. Conclusion, if not difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with Rina Begum"
p3,00:13:15.440,00:13:15.930,spk_1,The Degree
p3,00:13:15.930,00:13:32.760,spk_0,of judicialisation depends on the nature. This is a civil right at all. Therefore inclined to hold the rest of the periphery of such rights and present decision making place that coupled with judicial review on convention grounds are adequate.
p3,00:13:34.540,00:13:35.400,spk_3,"Yes,"
p3,00:13:35.640,00:13:36.160,spk_0,and
p3,00:13:42.340,00:13:56.370,spk_0,"Finally, at 55, this is I think now, in my lords opinion."
p3,00:14:01.280,00:14:51.170,spk_0,"55 dealing with Rina Begum. That case exposed about a third of the way down. That case explains more clearly any earlier case, the interrelation between the concepts, civil rights and the requirement of independent and impartial tribunal. The narrower the interpretation is given civil rights, the greater the need to insist on review by judicial tribunal exercising full powers. Conversely, the more elastic the interpretation is given, the more flexible must be the approach. The requirement very judicialisation of welfare schemes is to be avoided. What the house did in that case was to assume that deciding that Rina Begum's domestic right was also a civil right and made that assumption to hold that the absence for full fat file and jurisdiction did not disqualify. And paragraph 61 of that opinion."
p3,00:14:52.340,00:14:54.640,spk_2,"Okay, Yeah."

A bribe, that law being made in Rina Begum that if the lasting interpretation is given to, the Article 6 concept must also be given to the procedural clients about [inaudible] of that article. It's fine, I'm sorry. My Lord,  that is all I was going to say on our second submission. I appreciate it sounds like we're not making very good progress. But it was the overwhelming [inaudible].

p3,00:15:53.300,00:15:53.550,spk_2,to be
p3,00:15:53.600,00:16:12.830,spk_0,more sensible. And indeed so much has been gone through that I really don't need to go through much of the European cases in particular. I don't  think I need to go back to Brian. I did in fact go to it yesterday and took your Lordships and my Lady to it.
p3,00:16:12.840,00:16:17.890,spk_3,"Yes, we've seen those relevant bits. I think and they've been quoted again in later cases."
p3,00:16:17.910,00:16:38.850,spk_0,"Yes, I wanted to go to the full. It's slightly fuller, but I think I did take my Lordship, my lady to the relevant paragraphs as a whole. I didn't go to Kingsley. I referred to it. It's following 6. Paragraph 43. Sorry."

p3,00:16:42.440,00:17:00.490,spk_0,And I can really just go
p3,00:17:00.500,00:17:00.740,spk_3,to
p3,00:17:00.750,00:17:18.959,spk_0,"paragraph 52 whether or not the issue of whether or not the Games Gaming Board could find the applicant is a fit and proper person working in the gaming industry, having regard to what they had found against him"
p3,00:17:19.839,00:17:23.890,spk_3,So we see the same formula as we see cropping up again and again
p3,00:17:24.069,00:17:27.650,spk_0,yes. referred to though interestingly as  examples here at 52.
p3,00:17:28.270,00:17:29.860,spk_3,Yes.
p3,00:17:30.340,00:17:33.670,spk_0,"Uh, obviously it's not exhausted."
p3,00:17:34.040,00:17:38.360,spk_4,"Well, that's clear from paragraph 45 of Brian itself. Yes,"
p3,00:17:39.340,00:19:52.300,spk_0,"it doesn't always just has come to tend to be slightly created as if it's a formula in some of the others that that was my only point 53 the court notes The present case concerns the regulation of gaming industry, which, due to the nature of the industry, calls for particular monitoring undertaken by the gaming board subject matter of the decision appeared against was thus a classic exercise of administrative discretion. That does say what is meant here it is referring to the nature of the scheme, and to this extent the current case is analogous to Brian. Planning matters were initially determined by the authority in their mind, Inspector and to X the applicant was held, not [inaudible] proper person. The chief executive Insurance company Court does not accept the applicants contentions that because of what was at stake for him, he should have had the benefit of full, full court hearing on both the facts and law, even though the members of the panel we're not experts, they were advised by officials who were and the court finds administrative regulation of the gaming industry, including questions of whether specific individuals should hold particular facts to be inappropriate procedure. Again, we got the overall judgement following Brian, and here was a fairly clear and important right employment, which was in effect being taken away by reference to factual matters. Conduct the subject matter of the decision was the public function regulation of gaming, arrangement of housing is likewise a classically public and in that sense, administrative function and one which is equally necessary, even though, obviously, as we all know, the convention doesn't guarantee a right to housing any more than it guarantees a right to a job? Uh I haven't. While I haven't actually gone through [inaudible] with Your Lordship and my lady I don't actually think I need today to do so there. Is there any other higher off particular, so often In this case, it comes down to very little, actually. We were"
p3,00:19:52.310,00:19:53.850,spk_3,very carefully introduced to
p3,00:19:54.240,00:19:55.000,spk_0,Absolutely. [inaudible]
p3,00:19:55.550,00:19:56.540,spk_3,So we can
p3,00:19:56.550,00:20:56.170,spk_0,"Yeah, so I'm not actually going to turn that up. I don't think there is anything other than what we've already said, in particular with respect to quantum in our submission not only should not be said to be decided regardless of the impartiality issue, but cannot be on any sensible reading of it cannot be treated as if that was an incidental finding. If it was only about a fact which which which, to some extent is relevantly prompted, it would have been wholly irrelevant to the contrary? In our submission, it seems this was the critical element. Especially when we bear in mind that Brian and Kingsley were both fact cases and led to of course, the result that the schemes were the process was acceptable. Crompton is in volume six at flag 37."
p3,00:20:57.440,00:20:58.940,spk_3,"Yeah, Yeah."
p3,00:21:03.840,00:21:04.760,spk_2,Yes.
p3,00:21:09.540,00:21:35.160,spk_0,"I'm really only going to look at that again it was introduced and I did refer to it yesterday and introduced the insofar as it is a scheme, we know what it is. The Army board process of complaint, the need a paragraph 71 on page 12."
p3,00:21:36.840,00:21:41.920,spk_3,We have the phrase such factors as it's the same point as you were drawn to drawing our attention to
p3,00:21:41.930,00:22:28.460,spk_0,"I was just going to say it's an overall judgement subject matter the decision, safeguards, impartiality in fact, uh, all embedded within that At 72 onwards, Brian and Kingsley are distinguished on the basis of this [inaudible] because on the particular issue in the latter [inaudible] there was no specialist context. That's correct and it attributes [inaudible] to the individual case approach to, Of course, accept is how Strasbourg proceeds. And at 78"
p3,00:22:29.640,00:22:32.160,spk_0,to 79.
p3,00:22:34.940,00:23:31.350,spk_0,"really Just the first sentence of each, uh in the present application. It did not centre on a question of fact. And 79 therefore did have sufficiencies of judicial review was sufficient. We've made our submissions on this case, I think both originally and again yesterday, both when we opened it again, slightly when I was going through things. The scheme If it can be so called the Section 181 was so broad that it is only capable of being determined on a case by case approach, the subject and the nature of the subject matter of the particular cases could be simply anything [inaudible] the contexts are overwhelming Administrative as to dictate the outcome"
p3,00:23:33.740,00:23:33.980,spk_4,that
p3,00:23:33.980,00:24:15.110,spk_0,"the scheme could be saved an appropriate case. As it was, when it was not one of pure fact, I.e., weighing up the broadly three Brian features one of them. The scheme cannot be said to have weighed in favour if I can use shorthand of judicial review. Another, the first stage appeal was satisfactory. The Anderson approach, the third allowed Judicial Review again because it wasn't a fact. While the reasoning does focus on the fact element, it's fired. We've, of course, not suggested, that that's"
p3,00:24:15.110,00:24:16.470,spk_1,irrelevant at

p3,00:24:17.440,00:24:30.790,spk_0,Only that it does not amount too sufficient to call for departure in the scheme approach under Part seven. And obviously we are concerned about that because we can identify
p3,00:24:31.600,00:24:32.060,spk_3,part
p3,00:24:32.060,00:24:53.230,spk_0,"seven issues. My Lord, That's why I put that before coming under precedent because it's sort of neatly flows into it. That's all I want to say about on there own"
p3,00:24:53.240,00:24:53.960,spk_3,Thank you.
p3,00:25:03.140,00:25:46.540,spk_0,"Again. We've really made our submission in opening Crompton in our submission cannot be taken to have changed the multi factor approach. The Strasbourg case law as set out in Brian Crompton. The court applied Brian. That was paragraph 71. The 2 cases cases [inaudible] do not represent new jurisprudence. And that jurisprudence was fully taken into account in Rina Begum, and earlier cases in particular, [inaudible] and it has not been argued that it was"
p3,00:25:46.540,00:25:47.050,spk_2,not.
p3,00:25:49.840,00:26:18.850,spk_0,Nor can the analysis of firing Crompton be taken as making any change to the test. Crompton. The court's analysis resulted in a [inaudible] resulted in it distinguishing the latter case on the ground that the Central Issuance 5 could be a disputed fact. Where that was not the position in Crompton.
p3,00:26:20.440,00:26:20.670,spk_2,
p3,00:26:21.540,00:26:24.860,spk_0,There was no question of any lack of impartiality.
p3,00:26:27.240,00:26:32.460,spk_0,As opposed to a lack of structural independence in the equation that they were considering in crompton.
p3,00:26:34.340,00:27:35.920,spk_0,"nor was the issue of procedural safeguards at the first stage of any significance. So the factors which were the second basis of the decision inspired simply did not arise in Crompton. Accordingly, nothing in Crompton support the proposition that the Strasbourg jurisprudence has changed since Brain. Crompton was of course a decision of the chamber, not a grand chamber, which Kingsley was some [inaudible] Which is that the Kingsley, to that extent, the superior authority, they both have to be taken into account, to really recognise the difference. Uh My Lord, My Lady of the House of Lords has repeatedly emphasised that domestic courts should follow the clear and constant jurisprudence. The Strasbourg court. I wont go to them"
p3,00:27:35.920,00:27:39.280,spk_3,No we don't need to be reminded of the references. They're very familiar.
p3,00:27:39.290,00:27:47.510,spk_0,"I didn't think I would but [inaudible]  say that, Of course, My Lord, you also came back to it in dougherty"
p3,00:27:47.650,00:27:48.160,spk_3,Yes.
p3,00:27:48.640,00:28:03.460,spk_0,"I don't know. If you want to go to paragraph 19 about, there has to be very good reason to depart. Circumstances in Dougherty was I mentioned yesterday that McCann had disapproved the majority [inaudible]"
p3,00:28:11.640,00:28:14.810,spk_3,so you're really coming onto a president now are you?
p3,00:28:17.930,00:28:18.750,spk_0,"I have come onto it, I'm sorry if I haven't made that clear, that is what I said I would come back to"
p3,00:28:18.760,00:28:21.360,spk_3,"And the point is really quite a short one, isn't it?"
p3,00:28:21.400,00:29:06.490,spk_0,"It is Very short, I am almost at the end. Yes. There has to be a very good reason, as in Doherty, the court didn't follow McCann and abandoned Kay. I appreciate Your Lordship made the point, but it was a seven member committee in Kay, overruling or sorry. Being invited to overrule [inaudible] five, and you thought that it might need nine to overrule Kay was the point you were making in Doherty. But if your lordship I thought it was necessary like this, you would have said that we need to reconvene to consider McCann."
p3,00:29:06.990,00:29:41.150,spk_3,"And I think you can trust that with the Purdy case where we recognise the House of Lords recognised that what had been said in pretty could no longer stand. And it was a question of accepting that in order to maintain an orderly pattern of events, we had to accept this transport jurisprudence. So it wasn't a very difficult exercise to think that we ought to accept the Strasbourg case law in that situation. Non.  But you're saying for the reasons you've already given that we're not in that position yet"
p3,00:29:41.150,00:29:42.840,spk_0,here because your point
p3,00:29:42.840,00:29:49.450,spk_3,"is that Crompton hasn't changed anything. Indeed, Sophia didn't change anything. And it all goes back to Kingsley and Brown. And so"
p3,00:29:49.450,00:29:50.490,spk_0,on which is a
p3,00:29:50.490,00:29:51.560,spk_3,constant stream.
p3,00:29:51.940,00:31:04.170,spk_0,"Yes. and there's no constant, there's nothing constant about them. What we're really saying is, you know, one decision in Crompton and its analysis of law relevant to A particular set of circumstances doesn't comply with the fear of constant change and sets the bar too low to suggest that one such decision has brought about any significant change. And We respectfully invite the board to be mindful of the need for certainty both in particular areas and in relation to the standard set of when you will be willing to depart naturally, is the local authority trying to administer a difficult area as a result that diminishes rather than increases. Uh, my Lords, My Lady , I've done everything except compatibility now on which I should also be extremely brief. Perhaps I don't need to go to it. I was going to go to a [inaudible] at [inaudible] 314."
p3,00:31:25.780,00:31:44.670,spk_1,"sorry. I'm not quite sure what we're talking about at the moment, compatibility -- if you're wrong on your arguments thus far, yeah. The question then is can you read this scheme compatibly with the Article six X hypothesi unmet requirement?"
p3,00:31:45.040,00:31:47.560,spk_0,"My Lord, Yes. We say no. Yes"
p3,00:31:48.240,00:31:49.660,spk_3,And you say there has to be a declaration
p3,00:31:49.700,00:31:52.670,spk_0,We say there has to be a declaration. And we're alone on that.
p3,00:31:54.130,00:31:55.860,spk_1,"I mean, can I just be clear?"
p3,00:31:57.340,00:32:18.360,spk_1,"Going back to Croydon now. And I think, really, I'm possibly addressing my colleagues rather than you here, having decided that the question whether the child is a child is something is a president fact and therefore has to be capable of being so to speak reinvestigated as a primary fact."
p3,00:32:18.640,00:32:19.500,spk_2,We didn't decide that.
p3,00:32:19.510,00:32:34.640,spk_1,"Well, there it is. I've misread that part of it. I just thought paragraph, I lost it, but I thought Baroness Hale suggested that."
p3,00:32:36.140,00:32:37.340,spk_2,"My recollection is that we decided it purely on the construction of section 20 of the children act, without addressing the, without needing the president fact arguments to reach that"
p3,00:32:51.080,00:32:52.440,spk_1,"conclusion, although"
p3,00:32:52.440,00:32:54.230,spk_4,"the consequences, of course. Identical."
p3,00:32:54.240,00:33:34.730,spk_1,"Yes. Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am indeed corrected, but the consequence is it has to be capable of determination as a question of primary fact. Now, as I apprehend, but tell me if this is wrong, that was thought possible by the house in -- by this court, I should say, is being thought possible by this court in this case by reference, what, to the Wilkinson approach? That you can decide this primary fact within the scope of judicial review. That's how I apprehend the position is."
p3,00:33:34.740,00:33:36.320,spk_3,That's paragraph 33
p3,00:33:36.360,00:34:25.460,spk_1,"paragraph 32 and 33 which refers to Wilkinson. So it's just like [inaudible] which is, of course, the president fact case, where a judicial review, the ministry court can decide yes or no. Is this immigrant an illegal entrant qualifying for a minister to removal under the secretary etc etc etc  exactly the same here but that is possible within the scope, therefore, of judicial review. But why, then, if you're wrong on the arguments thus far? By the same token, although, of course we're talking to a Section 24 appealing point of law to the county court and not judicial review. What's the difference? Why couldn't this question be resolved within the scope of that appeal? That's my question."
p3,00:34:26.440,00:35:10.460,spk_0,"My Lord, I entirely understand that, and I think yesterday was coming close to sort of raising that myself. The answer for us is that uh huh proposition of presidental collateral fact has never been advanced in this case, at all. It has never been advanced in this case, and indeed it was forsworn in Ibrahim at first instance, now had it been advanced that a decision [inaudible] Your Lordship has in mind whether or not the letter"

That's what everybody foresaw. And that is, in a sense, the difference between this situation and the Croydon situation. In the Croydon situation, there was no statutory right of appeal, no process at all. So the only one would have to be by judicial review, which, if required, can be adapted to whatever procedure is appropriate for to determine what it has to determine. In this, we've got a statutory provision that says Question of law, which is why you're saying the only answer is to declare Section 24 incompatible, and then the government can go away and think out whether it wants to set up a specialist tribunal to deal with these things. Some sensible system, rather than clogging up the court or whatever. Um, whereas everybody else is saying, Oh, no, we can in somewhere rather read Section 24 to enable the county court to do what the county court has to do, just as, one did in certain other other contexts. We don't have to get into whether this is a president fact or not. We don't have to get into all of that. We can just look at Section four. That is the difference between Croydon and this situation.

And there's a clear difference between saying Article 6 does require an independent and impartial tribunal for fact finding exercises that, of course, we resist strongly. At the other end of the spectrum, there could be an argument and could have been an argument that Section 1935 and seven incorporate what might be called president or collateral facts within domestic law points that can be taken as one domestic public law.

p3,00:44:48.990,00:44:51.510,spk_3,Yes. We start when you're ready.
p3,00:44:52.090,00:51:52.700,spk_2,"Yeah, my lord. My lady. As your lordship’s know I am going to deal in its entirety with the first issue. Whether it's a civil right, I'm only going to deal with the second issue to the degree to make some supplementary comments, supplementary submissions to my friend Mr Arden's submissions. And then I will deal briefly with the matter of remedy. Where Mr Arden and I disagree, so far as the issue of Is this a civil right is concerned. Just so your lordships relationship know where I'm going. I'm going to deal first fairly quickly with the Strasbourg case law before Begum quickly because it's summarised in considerable depth in Begum. Then I will touch on Begum in relation to the civil rights issue. Then I will deal with the post Begum Strasbourg cases, then the Croydon case and lastly apply the tests to Part 7 of the Housing Act. Um, now in terms of the case law, up to Begum in respect of civil rights. First of all, it's important just to make clear there is no issue here that the claimants had some form of right, um, that's not disputed, and therefore the only question is whether it is a civil right within the meaning of Article 6. And it is, as your lordships will know very well clearly established that a civil right for the purposes of Article 6 is an autonomous concept. In other words, the way that it's described in domestic law is not determinative of whether it's a civil right or not, and again, to state what is certainly well known to my Lady Hale and my Lord I Hope from the Croydon case, Article 6 has extended into what English lawyers would consider two areas extended into what we would call public law in two ways. First of all, there are a series of cases about public law determinations which impact on private law rights, of which the classic examples are licencing. Decisions such as Kingsley planning decisions such as Brian and decisions relating to employment rights such as Albert and Lake Cont and into that category also now falls the case of Crompton, which relates to private law employment rights, albeit with a slight complication that it was a territorial army case. That line of cases in terms of is it a civil right is not what is an issue today. It's the second line of cases where there is a determination of a claim for a Social Security benefit, which is being suggested by my learned friends, has extended into Part 7 of the Housing Act and at that line of cases, really starts with the decision of the European court in a case called Felder Broker, which is in Volume 6 at tab 40. Uh huh and, yeah, Felda Brugger was a case concerning Dutch Social Security benefits, which were contributory benefits. In other words, the claimant had made payments under the equivalent of our national insurance scheme and whether her claim for the benefits fell within the term civil rights for Article 6 and I'll take your lordships in a moment to the key paragraphs. But the point of Felda Burger was that the European Court found that when it was a contributory benefits, it was directly analogous with a private insurance scheme benefit and therefore, in the same way that a private insurance scheme would give you the right to a would give a civil right and therefore Article 6 rights. If it was a contributory scheme, the same analysis must apply, and that's where one gets to Infeld a burger at paragraphs. Key part starts at page 8, paragraph 32. The European Court looks at the features of public law and says in 32 the first such factors as the character of the legislation. The legal rules governing Social Security benefits in the context of health insurance differ in many respects from the rules which apply to insurance in general, which are part of civil war civil law. The Netherlands state has assumed the responsibility of regulating the framework of the health health insurance scheme and overseeing the operation of that scheme. To this end, it specifies the categories of beneficiaries, defines the limits of the protection afforded, lays down the rates of the contributions and the allowances, et cetera, and that last sentence is important because it's picked up later in terms of the need for precise and clear rules. If one is to have an Article 6 civil right, then Paragraph 33 a second factor of relevance is the obligation to be insured against illness or, more precisely, the fact of being covered by insurance in the event of fulfilling the conditions laid down by the legislation. In other words, those concerned can either opt out of the benefits nor avoid having to pay the relevant contributions. And then, in 37 onwards, the court points to the private law features of the right and first of all, the personal and economic nature of the asserted right, a phrase which comes up again and again in the case law to begin with Paragraph 37. Mrs Feldberg was not affected in her relation with the public authorities as such acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, but in her personal capacity as a private individual, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming a right flowing from the specific rules laid down by the legislation in force. For the individual averting it such a right is often a crucial importance. This is especially so in the case of health insurance benefits, when the employee who is unable to work by reason of illness enjoys no other source of income. In short, the right in question was a personal, economic and individual right factor that brought it close to the civil sphere. And they go on in 38 to talk about the relationship with the employment contract, thus tying it in at that stage into private law rights. And then,"
p3,00:51:52.710,00:51:53.260,spk_4,at
p3,00:51:53.270,00:52:32.750,spk_2,"39 onwards, the court highlights the affinities with insurance under the ordinary law. Finally, paragraph 39. Finally, the Netherlands health insurance is similar in several respects to insurance under the ordinary law and then the third paragraph of 39. Such differences may exist between private sector insurance and social security, and private sector insurance and social security insurance do not affect the essential character of the link between the insured and the insurer. So stage one inf elder brother is contributory benefit directly analogous with insurance, right? Therefore, civil right."
p3,00:52:32.910,00:52:40.130,spk_3,"And the deductions are part of the analysis deductions at source, which is rather as if you are paying for the thing yourself. Indeed. That idea"
p3,00:52:40.140,00:55:23.470,spk_2,"Absolutely, My lord. And again similar in some European schemes to a private insurance scheme. One then goes from there to the extension of that principle for contributory benefits to non contributory benefits. And that is the case law, Salesi against Italy and minuto against Italy. And if I just ask your Lordships and Lady to look at  volume 7  tab 52. Just to summarise where one gets to in Selelaze is a non contributory welfare benefit scheme for the disabled. And what comes out of so lazy is that the distinction between contributory and non contributory benefits by 1993 when this judgement is given, was no longer one that could be sustained. And just to put that into a British context, if one thinks of the distinction between contributory benefits that one pays for through national insurance and non contributory benefits, that distinction has effectively been eaten away since the Second World War and is now very difficult to find in the legislation any principal distinction. So in so lazy, if one goes understand, take the key passages. If one goes to paragraph 19, where the court is dealing with the applicability of Article 19, it starts by the court, referring back to Felder Bruggere and in the third line of 19. At that time, the court noted, there was great diversity in the legislation and practise of the member states of the Council of Europe, has regarded the nature of entitlement to insurance benefits under social security schemes. Nevertheless, the development in the law that was initiated by those judgments and the principle of equality of treatment warrant taking the view that today the general rule is that Article 61 does apply in the field of social insurance. In the present case, however, the question arises in connection with welfare assistance and not, as previously cited social insurance. Certainly there are differences between the two, but they cannot be regarded as fundamental in the present stage of development of social security law. This justifies following in relation to the entitlement to welfare allowances. The opinion, which emerges from the aforementioned judgments as regard the classifications of the right to social insurance benefits, namely that state intervention is not sufficient to establish the Article 61 is inapplicable"
p3,00:55:23.480,00:55:31.180,spk_3,"by state intervention were taken back to paragraph 18, which is The government meets the entire cost of this. Indeed, that's the point."
p3,00:55:31.180,00:55:36.410,spk_2,That's the point that it's not a contribute. There's no contributory element.
p3,00:55:36.410,00:55:36.880,spk_3,"Yes,"
p3,00:55:39.340,00:57:09.460,spk_2,"as in the two cases previously referred to, other considerations argue in favour of the applicability of Article 61. In the instant case, the most important of these lies in the fact that despite the public law features pointed out by the government, Mrs Salahi was not affected and her relations with the administrative authorities as such. Acting in the exercise of discretionary powers, she suffered an interference with her means of subsistence and was claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute giving effect to the Constitution. Um, so that's where the law has got to on Social Security benefits, My lords, your lordships, no minuto Is that volume 7 tab 48 but I don't think it's necessary to go to that effectively repeats the Celozzi tasks. And in my submission, what comes out of those tests? Those case law up to that stage is that in order to fall within Article 61, it needs to be an economic and individual right. It needs to be a right flowing from specific rules, and it needs to be a right arising from a scheme where there is no discretion in the method of meeting the right. So just to counter submission, that was certainly made strongly in Croydon. The issue is not whether the right is something that is important to somebody. It might be very important, but that doesn't make it a civil, right?"
p3,00:57:09.830,00:57:10.030,spk_0,Yeah.
p3,00:57:13.030,00:58:35.700,spk_2,"Can I then turn? Because I'm doing this chronologically rather than just looking at the European case law and then the domestic case law. If I can then turn to Bagan, which is in volume four, Tab 20. Now, it's right to say that the House of Lords in Begum were prepared to assume that civil rights Article 6 was engaged in order to go on to consider whether there was a bridge. But they did consider the matter of engagement in some detail, particularly Lord Hoffmann, and in my submission, it does give a very powerful steer to the approach to be taken now. I appreciate your Lordships have now looked at big twice at some length in this court, so I am going to really do no more than just 0.2 paragraphs. Lord Bingham, Paragraph 6 between letters E and F refers to fill the brother and so lazy and then says to hold that the right enjoyed by Rana Begum is a civil right, for the purposes of Article 6 would go further than Strasburg has yet gone satisfied. Bye, Mr Sales argument that the decision of the court by no means necessarily be favourable to him. And in my submission, nothing has changed from there."
p3,00:58:35.780,00:58:43.500,spk_4,"Actually, nothing's changed from Mr Sales Argument in Rana Begum to Mr Griffin's argument in Croydon, to your argument"
p3,00:58:43.650,00:58:46.450,spk_2,"very much. My, you know, I'm sorry it's expanded."
p3,00:58:46.450,00:58:52.870,spk_4,"It's become more elegant. No doubt it. There are more cases to deal with, but the actual structure of the argument is"
p3,00:58:53.990,00:59:19.280,spk_2,"absolutely right. My lady and I can only apologise for two things. One I'm sure it's no more elegant, but secondly, that as the new cases have come, a lot of cases have come along. One has to deal with them. But also, of course, that hope has heard these arguments. Now at least three times, if not many more in your ladyship twice in very short succession. But the other members of the court who I have to at least trust through the authorities,"
p3,00:59:19.280,00:59:36.750,spk_4,"of course. No, no, I wasn't. And I do apologise. Wasn't it anyway criticising you? I realised entirely why you have to do it. What I was struck with is the similarity in the basic shape of the argument which has been advanced on, Shall I say the governmental side on this issue, going back at least as far as rutabaga."
p3,00:59:37.120,01:00:37.520,spk_2,"And my Lord, my Lady, did one quite important point that came out, comes out of that in my submission in room to bargain, which was decided in 2003, it was clear that there was a little diffidence. If I can put it like that from the house, that matters might move on in Strasbourg. But in fact, in my submission, we are still going back to sell Asian bonito in the mid nineties, and the European Court has not moved on. And in my submission, what that shows is that actually, it has now come to a point where this court should say the Strasbourg case law does not say a benefiting kind is a civil right. The Strasbourg case law might say that next week, next month in 10 years time, and if it does, we'll have to revisit this issue. But actually where we are now is that Strasburg has fixed on a line hasn't changed that line now since the Lazy, which is 16 years ago. So"
p3,01:00:37.530,01:00:42.930,spk_1,"has anybody ever tried to put the benefiting kind to Strasbourg? Well,"
p3,01:00:43.310,01:02:12.720,spk_2,"not in these terms, my Lord, but I am going to show you the unpronounceable Italian prisoner of war case about article, Article one, protocol one writes where the Strasbourg court made clear that so far as Article 1 protocol 1 is concerned, Steck is the high point, and it comes to my submission is you'll see in a judgement of the steak admissibility decision, the European Court said, Let's try and keep Article 1, Protocol one, Article 6 in line on this issue. Then somebody tries to put article off one protocol one a bit further, and the European Court says no, let's stick at step. So on that side, and my learned friend, Mr Gowdy suggested that the case law and Article one Protocol 1 would support him. But in fact, in my submission on the Italian prisoner of war case, it goes quite the other word it suggests. Don't push the line any further, can I? Then just briefly show your lordships the passages in the other speeches in the House of Lords? Lord Hoffmann, who dealt with the civil rights issue after a the breach issue, and it starts at paragraph 60 and I would commend the entirety of this part of Lord Hoffman's speech because he analysed the law as always so very, very clearly. But he"

p3,01:02:22.500,01:05:16.650,spk_2,"highlights the fact that this is a highly discretionary scheme. If you go to the top of page 456 in paragraph 67 the whole scheme is shot through with discretions, in which either the council's duty is dependent upon being satisfied of some state of affairs or can be discharged in various ways of its own choosing. By contrast, in Manito, the court said that the management committee of the local Public Health Service, after verifying that the applicant satisfied the conditions for entitlement to the allowance, should simply have made an arithmetical calculation of the quantum. So the discretionary elements in Part 7 were, in Lord Hoffman's view, extremely important. And it it's important to recognise the discretionary elements on a whole series of the stages in the Part seven decision making process. And then, in 69 between, uh, in about the sixth Line, he makes the same point as Lord Bingham that to accept this case, a part 7 claim, as being a civil right would be to go further than Strasburg has gone. And then he's in 70. He says he's not going to decide it. Then, looking briefly at the other members of the Judicial Committee, My Lord, Lord Hope Page 73 agreed with Lord Bingham and Lord Lord Hoffmann. Lord Millett also addressed civil rights in some detail, and the key concluding paragraphs are 90 onwards, where he deals with Silesia, Silesian Minuto, Felder Burger and 91. He says the present case undoubtedly goes further. Still, it has four features which take it beyond the existing law. It's benefiting kind. It involves priority between competing claimants for a finite amount of housing stock. Three. The Housing Authority has a discretion as to the manner in which it discharges its duty. And four ultimately, the question for determination calls for an exercise of judgement. And they're 92 he analyses those. And then, at the end, he says, Rana Begum cannot be said to be claiming an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. He then, to be fair, says in 94. But he's persuaded by these considerations are extending the scope of Article 61 is a desirable end, but needs to go hand in hand with moderating the requirements in the interests of administration, where administrative decisions are involved and then says in the unsettled light of the case law, content to assume without deciding civil right."

p3,01:06:13.910,01:06:50.210,spk_2,"there are protections that judicial review, of course, but I'm not in a position to speculate as to whether in other jurisdictions you might have a situation with no protection and, of course, referring to case or that I'm sure your lordships familiar with it will undoubtedly have been the case in a case like Geiger zoos. Where, unless the case fell within the ambit of Article 1 protocol 1, the Austrian government could racially discriminate between ethnic Austrians and non ethnic Austrians that the European Court would be keen to ensure that that kind of dispute did fall within some kind of control,"
p3,01:06:50.580,01:06:51.090,spk_4,but
p3,01:06:51.480,01:07:13.410,spk_2,it's difficult to take the point any further without the specific facts of a particular European case where there hasn't been protection here. There is no possible doubt that there is significant judicial protection through the judicial review process and on the facts of the Housing Act through the Section 2 for repeal.
p3,01:07:14.480,01:07:14.750,spk_4,So I
p3,01:07:14.760,01:07:30.150,spk_1,"just assumed it wasn't I mean, assume government simply said, terrorists are It's too much of this judicial review and Section 24 appeal about and but we'll leave the scheme otherwise intact. Is that on your submission? Strasbourg proof."
p3,01:07:30.300,01:07:45.000,spk_2,"But, my Lord, it would be impossible. It would be exceptionally difficult, surely, in the light of cases like Anna's Minnick for the UK government to produce a scheme which did not give rise to judicial review."
p3,01:07:45.430,01:07:45.920,spk_1,So it
p3,01:07:45.920,01:07:49.530,spk_2,"might be Article 6 proof, but it wouldn't be judicial review"
p3,01:07:49.530,01:07:50.210,spk_3,proof
p3,01:07:52.580,01:07:53.330,spk_2,"now, whether we"
p3,01:07:53.330,01:07:58.900,spk_1,"have our own constitutional way of dealing with really what you're saying, okay"
p3,01:08:00.620,01:08:21.089,spk_2,"and then finally flawed. Walker, who starts at paragraph 108 and who again deals in some detail with civil rights and the key paragraph, is paragraph 114 where he refers again to criteria very similar to those in Lord Millett speech."
p3,01:08:21.569,01:08:22.190,spk_4,"Um,"

There are different periods by which accommodation can be, uh, secured. And for the local authorities, duty comes to an end. If the applicant refuses an offer of accommodation, the"
p3,01:08:52.960,01:08:57.000,spk_4,"long three has changed since, hasn't it? The actual law has changed."
p3,01:08:57.470,01:08:59.150,spk_2,"I believe that's why, my lady,"
p3,01:08:59.160,01:09:05.589,spk_4,"Yes, well, Section 193 was amended, so 3 is not necessarily relevant now, but it"
p3,01:09:06.500,01:09:06.950,spk_3,and the
p3,01:09:06.960,01:09:07.660,spk_2,rest is
p3,01:09:08.120,01:09:23.190,spk_3,"as far as four. As far as four is concerned, we really need to read the sentences of Package It, if it refuses which the authority are satisfied is suitable, which is where subsection 5 is worded. It's a combination of things that all go together,"
p3,01:09:23.569,01:10:11.420,spk_2,"and when I come briefly to look at the scheme in my submission, that is a very important point because unlike any social Security scheme, this is a duty that can be discharged in the discharges, its subject to highly evaluative judgments as to whether or not an offer of suitable accommodation has been made. Now, that's in very stark contrast to income support or the kind of benefits insulation monitor where there would be no question of the civil rights having been lost because of an evaluative process. So it fits into this pattern of a very discreet, judgmental scheme or evaluative scheme with a lot of my lady described in Croydon as soft edged criteria."
p3,01:10:11.540,01:10:48.530,spk_3,"You can see this in the letters that were written. Actually, it's quite interesting that, of course, certainly in this case, the issue of whether or not she actually received the letter is there. Although she infected, it doesn't press the point as we know. But then a great deal of effort has gone into assessing suitability, and we see the same in Ibrahim that the concentration, perhaps naturally, the office is interested to see whether actually this was suitable accommodation in the first place, where it was a proper offer to make it all. I can see these issues or merging rather as the subsection suggests they do,"
p3,01:10:48.830,01:10:56.010,spk_2,"and one would assume, my lord, Although I don't claim to be an expert in housing law to have the kind of day to day expertise"

It will be arguments about that. Black wasn't suitable for various reasons. And doubtless that's why the review officer focused on that issue. So, yeah, in my submission, Begum, although I freely except it was over to deal with the issue in a great deal of detail and point to a whole series of reasons why to extend civil right to apart seven claim would be to go beyond Strasbourg. I turned them to the post strapped to the post Begum cases. Um, and Reliance is placed by my learned friend Mr Gowdy as it was by Mr Howell in Croydon on that series of Russian and Ukrainian cases,"

p3,01:11:54.630,01:12:46.370,spk_2,"all of which substantively concerned state housing in various forms. But as a Lord, Hope and Lady Hale both referred to in the Croydon case, each one of those decisions is actually about the enforcement of a court order or, more precisely, the palpable lack of enforcement of the court order within the relevant judicial systems. And none of those cases refer to Felda brother so lazy or Minuto line of case law. I'm only going to go to one of them just to make the point. Good. There are a lot and they're all rather the repetitious. But if I go to what I think is the first, which is Teetering Rini and Russia Volume 7 division 58 yeah,"
p3,01:12:53.050,01:12:53.380,spk_0,mhm.
p3,01:12:53.850,01:13:50.570,spk_2,"Okay, a particular favourite because, as your lordships can see from the from the head note, the applicants were both retired judges. In 1994 the District Court allowed the first applicants claim against the relevant local authority provision of state housing, for which he was entitled as a judge. No appeal was brought against that judgement, and it became final. Later that year, enforcement proceedings were instituted. Judgement could not, however, be enforced because the authority did not possess any available housing or have the financial resources to purchase house. By 2004 10 years later, the judgement had still not been enforced. And, um, I think the central paragraphs on the facts page three paragraphs 5 and 61 sees the terms of the court order and then the efforts to enforce our set out below."
p3,01:13:50.950,01:13:57.280,spk_4,It's clear that the rules are very precise about what particular people were entitled to in terms of state housing.
p3,01:13:57.290,01:13:58.570,spk_2,"Yes, well, I"
p3,01:13:58.570,01:14:02.020,spk_4,"would judge You're entitled to this. Plus, I"
p3,01:14:02.030,01:15:48.460,spk_2,"think, to go off precisely relevant point to the case, my lady. My understanding is that under the old Soviet system that were very precise per metre allocations, depending on various criteria. Paragraph 40  alleged violation of Article 61 of the convention The court reiterates that Article 61 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to the civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way, it embodies the right to report of which the right of access that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters constitutes one aspect. However, that right would be illusory. If a contracting states domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party, it would be inconceivable that Article 61 should describe in detail the procedural guarantees afforded to litigants proceedings that are fair, public and expeditious without protecting the implementation of judicial decisions to construe. Article 6 is being concerned exclusively. The access to a court and conduct of proceedings will be likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law, which the contracting states undertook to respect when they ratified the convention. Execution of a judgement given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the trial for the purposes of Article 6 of Hornsby. So, my Lord, in my submission, that's the ratio of this case, and that is the pattern of all the subsequent cases. They focus on the non enforceability of the court orders in question. In each case, there is no reference to field of rigour line of cases, and there is no suggestion that"
p3,01:15:49.240,01:15:49.410,spk_0,there
p3,01:15:49.410,01:15:53.960,spk_2,was any intention to extend the case law in that respect.
p3,01:15:53.970,01:16:08.570,spk_3,"Does this mean that there is a breach of Article 6 whenever the state does not provide adequate means for the enforcement of a judgement, irrespective of the nature of the judgement."
p3,01:16:08.580,01:16:53.160,spk_2,"Well, my lord, I'm afraid I can't answer that question. That appears to be the way the European court has approached it in these cases. But they don't say that that will always be the case. And they simply don't address the issue of the circumstances in which enforceability of a court or non enforcement of the court order might give rise to articles. Might not, I think, better to say give rise to Article 6 cases. So take the classic example where we know Article six civil rights don't apply Saracini and Tax European Court said, In terms of tax does not, tax disputes do not give rise to a civil right."
p3,01:16:53.240,01:16:54.040,spk_1,What doesn't
p3,01:16:54.080,01:16:55.990,spk_2,tax dispute tax

p3,01:16:57.190,01:17:52.580,spk_2,"disputes and the case law was absolutely clear. Now I don't think one can say in the light of the teetering the line of cases if you had a court order in one in a jurisdiction that said, the government must pay back £10 million to somebody because they overpaid taxes, and after 10 years, the member government had failed to do it for no good reason at all. I can see there would be an argument on Bettarini that that was a civil right, because the non enforcement of judgments would give rise to the civil right. And I would assume that the member government would argue, Oh, no, it's not because the case law is clear that tax disputes don't give rise to a civil right. But I'm afraid, my lord, I can't answer how the European court would square that dilemma."
p3,01:17:52.590,01:18:46.080,spk_3,"There's a hint in the last sentence of paragraph 40 that one really is dealing with an Article 6 situation. It talks about the The execution of the judgement is an integral part of the trial for the purposes of Article 6. And it rolls back into the thing and saying It's a bit ridiculous to have all sorts of guarantees about Article 6 as to the conduct of the trial without protecting the product of the trial, uh, and that Rather suggests you're in the in an Article 6 type of case when you're contemplating whether the execution of the judgement is to be regarded as part of an Article 6 protection, I'm not sure where that leaves your argument as to the effect of this case, because they haven't explored the reasons for thinking it was an Article 6 case in the first place."
p3,01:18:46.090,01:18:47.230,spk_2,That's
p3,01:18:47.230,01:19:08.850,spk_4,"the problem. That was what enabled Mr Howell to argue very strongly to us in the Croydon case. It's taken for rent because we're talking about the right to a trial. Um, and the right to a trial depends upon its being a civil right. So they've obviously taken it for granted that the trial that they got to get the order depended upon the existence of a civil right."
p3,01:19:09.320,01:19:43.150,spk_2,"One can see the logical thrust of Mr Howell's submissions on that, but there is no hint in the case law that they have actually grappled with that issue. And in my submission, if they were just assuming it was a civil right having thought about it, then it is inevitable that they would have prefered to sell Asian Monita because there can be no possible question that benefits such as this goes beyond situation Monita."
p3,01:19:43.520,01:20:00.560,spk_3,"Well, to some extent, the discussion is focused by the argument. I don't know that we were not very much about the reach of the argument, either in this case or indeed all the others in this group they call for for follow the same pattern. I think one after the other almost mirror each other."
p3,01:20:00.880,01:20:19.870,spk_2,"Absolutely. All the following cases just rely on this case, and then it becomes a rolling bush of cases. But there is no suggestion, as far as one can tell in this case that those authorities were ever referred to, or that the European Court ever thought about the issue in that way"
p3,01:20:19.880,01:20:20.730,spk_0,at
p3,01:20:21.410,01:20:29.420,spk_2,"and I appreciate that Mr Howell goes from there to say, Well, they must have assumed. But in my submission, that's a huge leap of logic."
p3,01:20:29.430,01:20:46.430,spk_1,"You could say as soon as you've actually got a specific court judge, then whatever. Whether or not you previously had a civil right at that point that has crystallised into a civil right, could you not? I"
p3,01:20:46.440,01:21:06.260,spk_3,"would have thought you certainly could have been arbitration proceedings, which, as a result of the contract to go to arbitration and produced an award which had the backing of the contract, and you would then say, Well, the contract dictates it should be enforced and force of the arbitration agreement. There is a civil right to have it enforced,"
p3,01:21:06.580,01:21:16.550,spk_2,"but I would have thought in that case, my lord, there would be no possible doubt about it because the contract would give rise to a private right which would undoubtedly"
p3,01:21:16.700,01:21:17.410,spk_4,be
p3,01:21:17.410,01:21:18.290,spk_2,a civil right
p3,01:21:18.530,01:21:27.730,spk_3,"to worry about Article 6. And as to the way the wood won the way the arbitration was conducted in the private proceedings, the private arbitration proceedings"
p3,01:21:28.610,01:21:31.580,spk_2,"Well, you Article 6 would undoubtedly be engaged"
p3,01:21:31.580,01:21:32.440,spk_3,and then the question
p3,01:21:32.440,01:21:36.460,spk_2,of whether it was met. I think that having been through somewhat of the
p3,01:21:36.460,01:21:36.940,spk_4,same
p3,01:21:37.510,01:21:46.180,spk_2,thought process is I think the trickier question might come in an area of pure public law where you get a court order
p3,01:21:47.510,01:21:48.590,spk_4,that the
p3,01:21:48.590,01:22:04.970,spk_2,public authority does something very specific and then that is simply not enforced. And there's no there is no case law that determines whether that would necessarily give rise to a civil right. I think there must be a very strong argument on the teetering the line of authorities that it does.
p3,01:22:04.980,01:22:18.750,spk_1,"I was just thinking of in this case, the county court judge said, You go and re decide this because you've gone wrong in law, you've got a judgement. If the authorities simply said terrorism, we're not bothering to do that. I mean, then you're into this territory. Well,"
p3,01:22:18.760,01:22:33.230,spk_2,"May then we'll may then come into a slightly grey area, My Lord, with respect, you might get a county court in this under the housing Act or the administrative court in other fields of public law saying Go away and decided or go away and meet your"

p3,01:22:34.490,01:22:42.520,spk_2,"in a holy, unspecified way. And there would be a strong argument that wouldn't give rise to a civil wide. But if you had the county court saying, or"
p3,01:22:43.200,01:22:43.440,spk_4,it's
p3,01:22:43.440,01:23:02.610,spk_2,"easier, perhaps in an administrative court situation saying, You must give Baroness Hale that flat because that's what you promised her on the basis of a legitimate expectation then that might well give rise to a civil right? It's some,"
p3,01:23:03.100,01:23:03.520,spk_4,"okay,"
p3,01:23:04.100,01:23:04.990,spk_2,but it's just not. It
p3,01:23:04.990,01:23:11.330,spk_1,might say that the only way you can properly exercise your discretion here is to pay expound
p3,01:23:13.100,01:23:13.270,spk_2,the
p3,01:23:13.270,01:23:17.820,spk_1,ordinary. You just send it back. But there are cases where you go that far.
p3,01:23:17.830,01:23:18.280,spk_4,"Yes,"
p3,01:23:18.700,01:23:48.110,spk_2,"it's possible I would accept on this line of authority. It's possible that that would give rise. The way the European Court would analyse it is that would give rise to a to a civil rights, the enforcement of the order. And in my submission, that's a much more likely interpretation of these cases than that. They were assuming that the substantive matter that is the grant of public housing had suddenly gone a huge step beyond Silesian Benito."
p3,01:23:49.200,01:23:58.600,spk_3,"The final sentence of paragraph 40 however, does point in the opposite direction, doesn't it? Yeah,"
p3,01:24:06.490,01:24:07.480,spk_2,"to some degree,"
p3,01:24:07.520,01:24:10.720,spk_3,do we know what? And Hornsby

p3,01:24:21.820,01:24:26.570,spk_2,I think I can't pretend I know Hornsby. I may have checked it

p3,01:24:27.860,01:24:31.690,spk_2,but I haven't checked it for today. I'll check
p3,01:24:32.150,01:25:04.190,spk_3,"in traditional international terms. This is really a case of denial of justice and one can quite easily see how it is that if you have a judgement against the state, um, it would be a denial of justice for the state not to honour that, even in this country, there's still no execution against the crown. Is that if the judgement is not, is not money judgments not complied with, there's nothing you can actually do about it."
p3,01:25:05.790,01:25:05.830,spk_1,I
p3,01:25:05.840,01:25:09.510,spk_2,"don't know the answer to that. I assume you could judicially review them if nothing else, but,"
p3,01:25:09.990,01:25:13.850,spk_3,"Well, what would that"

p3,01:25:23.210,01:25:51.310,spk_2,"But, my Lord, I agree with your lordships overarching point. It reads like a decision about the enforcement of judgments against the state and where the state chooses not to enforce a judgement. The European Court will do something about it, and Article 6 is the way to do it. It does not, in my submission, read like a case which is seeking to extend a very precise area of your under article 6, which is subject to a series of well known and often referred to authorities."
p3,01:25:53.690,01:26:35.340,spk_3,"I suppose one could read the earlier sentences. There is just, uh, telling us what Article 6 tells us and saying, Well, it has a lot of stuff about in it about things being fair and public and expeditious and so on and so forth. And one reads into Article 61 the necessary bit about making sure that if it results in a judgement, there is an enforceable judgement. It should be enforced. I mean, it may be going no deeper into the thing than they're just saying. What? What? Article 6 is describing and say, Well, we can we can see that this issue about enforcement is covered by the broad generality of what Article 6 is talking about?"
p3,01:26:35.350,01:26:43.750,spk_2,"Yes, what they don't do. Unfortunately, in paragraph 40 is say anything about why we are in article six territory at"

p3,01:26:44.690,01:27:07.800,spk_2,"Just don't address that. And in my submission, the fair view of it is that's the approach the court taking in all these cases is we've got a judgement against against the government. The government is simply not complying with it. Over a very long period of time, we're going to take steps to stop them. Yeah, um"
p3,01:27:08.380,01:27:08.680,spk_4,"I mean,"
p3,01:27:08.680,01:27:12.490,spk_1,isn't it relevant that they also find a violation of Article 1 critical one?
p3,01:27:12.980,01:27:50.710,spk_2,"Yeah. Um mhm. Uh huh. About my lord. My recollection is that that's yeah, very much about the facts of the particular cases and that in each case, there was a, um, yeah, effectively, a legitimate expectation, as they say in 47 to that possession. And it comes down to an analysis of the nature of the right in question."
p3,01:27:50.710,01:27:55.700,spk_1,When do they say that the right accrued from Article 1 protocol one purposes?
p3,01:27:57.580,01:28:00.250,spk_3,"Well, 48 is by virtue of the judgement."
p3,01:28:00.450,01:28:06.400,spk_1,"Well, that supports the view that I suggest that once you've got your judgement, then you've got an enforceable right."
p3,01:28:07.970,01:28:08.150,spk_4,It

p3,01:28:21.970,01:29:01.290,spk_2,"Yes, it does depend. I suspect on the nature of the right that's being given. So what was an issue here was a very different type of duty in terms of providing housing to what appears under part seven of the Housing Act, yeah, we see that emerging out of 47 in terms of legitimate expectation in 48 in terms of the social tenancy agreements. And then one goes back to"

And I don't want to make concessions about the scope of to Torino in terms of some future administrative court order. But so far as today's case is concerned in my submission, your lordships analysis fits well with mine."
p3,01:29:40.870,01:29:41.190,spk_0,Okay?
p3,01:29:41.670,01:29:42.080,spk_2,Yeah.
p3,01:29:44.170,01:29:44.720,spk_3,Yes.
p3,01:29:45.160,01:29:51.540,spk_2,"Now, there are two other Article 6 cases on the scope of"
p3,01:29:51.540,01:29:52.610,spk_4,"civil rights, which"
p3,01:29:52.610,01:34:39.710,spk_2,"I should just refer to because, my Lord, Lord Hope referred to them in the updraft opinion in Croydon That wound Bram and Wazo. And they're both in the additional bundle of authorities. Yeah, they're both on quite different facts from the present case. First of all wound Braun, which is at the second tab. And that is a case which concerned whether or not the Dutch government could change the terms of its subsidy regime to housing associations in particular in respect of housing social housing funded by private capital. I don't think it's necessary to get into the precise terms of the nature of the change. It's quite a long section from page 2 onwards of the circumstances of the cap of the case. It's all about changing state subsidy to to what we would call RSI’s to housing associations, and the housing association sought to challenge the decision. Um, and one can see their complaint at page 10 of the judgement, the applicants associations complained. The Council of State cannot be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 61, in that it carries out both advisory and judicial functions. The applicant associations further complaint under Article 61 of the convention that they have no access to court for a judicial examination of the lawfulness of the Act of 31st of May 95 on the removal from the balance sheets of financial support for public housing. Since Article 120 of the Constitution prohibits such an examination, and then they also brought a complaint under Article one Protocol one, Article 14 and then, uh, the key passages or at the bottom of page 11. The present case concerns the over under 12. The present case concerns the allocation of state subsidies based on statute revisions aimed at financially supporting non profit making institutions like the applicant associations whose sole aim is to work in the field of public housing. Financial support based on an act of Parliament and then over the page. Yeah, Court considers that in these circumstances, the relationship between the applicant associations and state is mainly of a public law nature. However, the presence of public law features in itself does not exclude that rights and obligations asserted through state intervention have such an impact on an individual personal situation that these rights and obligations should nevertheless be classified as civil within the autonomous meaning of Article 6 1 and then in the next paragraph. Having regard to the specific position held by the applicant associations, the court considers that it cannot be regarded as comparable to that of an individual whose personal situation could be directly affected by changes in state policies. In the field of subsidy awards, the applicant associations, Institutional aim and their role in the field of public housing is of a typical general interest character, albeit exercised by legal persons established and operating under private law. Now that's a very different case from the present, and I'll show your lordships in a moment. What, my lord Lord, hope reference to it in the Croydon case. Uh, and then the other authority just to note in passing is the next one, Suazo, which is? It was about an applicant seeking his personal records and whether that was a civil right. And the passage that my lord Lord Hope referred to N Croydon is at page 5. In that case, it was found This rather it was found that this was an article 61 civil right, and in the main paragraph in on page five, about eight lines down. After the reference to the law of 1978 the court said further, the court considers that this right is of a private nature. Firstly, it concerns an individual right of which the applicant may consider himself the holder. Secondly, the documents requested by the applicant, all of which concern the circumstances recruitment related directly and exclusively to his personal situation. So the court there is emphasising the private nature of the right and the individual nature of it, of which the applicant considers himself holder. And then he"

p3,01:34:43.590,01:34:47.460,spk_2,absolutely not at all surprising that that was a civil right.

p3,01:35:09.540,01:35:09.850,spk_4,And
p3,01:35:09.860,01:36:46.850,spk_2,"then, my lords, can I refer to the third case that, my lord Lord hope refers to? And that is the admissibility decision in stank. Yeah, and this is relevant for a couple of reasons. Steck was the case in which ultimately went to the Grand Chamber. Yeah, which dealt with the longstanding question whether for the purposes of the ambit of Article one protocol one, a non contributory benefit well fell within the ambit of Article 1 Protocol 1. It was critical because if it did fall within the ambit, then one could argue about Article 14 and non discrimination. And it had been a long standing debate as to whether the European court had got to the point where non contributory benefits i e those that weren't directly analogous to insurance schemes did fall within the ambit. And what the court found in Steck was that there was no longer a justification for the arbitrary distinction within Article 1 protocol, one between contributory and non contributory benefits. And at least part of their reason for reaching that conclusion was because so lazy in respect of Article six had some at least 10 years before 12 years before had found that that distinction was no longer justifiable"
p3,01:36:47.530,01:36:47.860,spk_4,for
p3,01:36:47.860,01:38:57.850,spk_2,"Article 6 purposes and at paragraphs 47 48. In the admissibility decision, the court dealt with this matter 47. The convention must also be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its various provisions. It is noteworthy in this respect that in its case law on the applicability of Article 61, the court originally held that claims only wealth claims regarding only welfare benefits which form part of a contributory schemes, were because of the similarity to private insurance schemes sufficiently personal and economic to constitute the subject matter of disputes for the determination of civil rights. Seefeld Burger, However, in so lazy article 61 was held also to apply to a dispute over entitlement to a non contributory welfare benefit. The court, emphasising that the applicant had an assessor to bill, right of an individual and economic nature to social benefits. It thus abandoned the comparison with private insurance schemes and the requirements for a form of contract between the individual and the state and then his reference to Shoeless Kragen and then 48. It's in the interest of the coherence of the convention as a whole that the autonomous concept of possessions in Article one protocol one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of peculiar rights. Under Article 61. It is, moreover, important to adopt an interpretation of Article one protocol, one which avoids inequalities of treatment based on distinctions which in the present day appear illogical or unsustainable. So that's where the courts saying the two articles should go hand in hand. And then my learned friend Mr Gowdy goes from there to suggest well, Article 1 Protocol 1 would support his analysis that benefits in kind, such as those under Part 7 fall within Article 1, Protocol 1, and for that purpose I want I've brought an additional authority, which should be on your Lordships desk called well, it starts associates.

p3,01:39:48.120,01:39:50.410,spk_1,so it's plainly a mistake and it should be the same.
p3,01:39:50.410,01:41:45.710,spk_2,"Yes, I'm sorry. I've never spotted that. Yes, it's all about the Second World War, and it's about the period when the Italians and the Germans fell out and the Germans forced a number of Italians to go to Germany to work as forced labour. But the point of the case is that the scheme excluded prisoners of war and the claimants were prisoners of war, and they argued that the claims fell within the ambit of Article 1 protocol 1. And then they sought to argue under Article 14 that it was discriminatory, without justification in respect of prisoners of war. And one can paragraph 16. Uh huh. On August the 11th, 2001, the applicant association of former Italian military internee, Um and Mr Fiorini has been subject to forced labour as a civilian lodged a constitutional complaint. And one can see that the top of page 149 bottom have paid one full rate the conditions of eligibility. And it was the third limb which was the problematic one. Prisoner of war status does not entitle to benefit. So that was the substance of the complaint. And then if one goes to page 156 can I apologise for the side-lining? I'm afraid I took these out of the rjm bundle and they will marked up page 156 paragraph 70"
p3,01:41:45.710,01:41:47.220,spk_3,five. The
p3,01:41:47.220,01:44:37.450,spk_2,"court has already found that the Italian military internees cannot claim to have a legitimate expectation of compensation for the detention and forced labour and the fact that issue therefore do not fall within the ambit of Article 1 Protocol 1. This finding is not contradicted by the court's judgement. In the case of Stack. In that case, the court held non contributory social benefits funded by General taxation fall within the scope of Article 1 Protocol 1. The court decided that although that provision does not grant the right to receive a Social Security payment of any kind, if a state does decide to establish a benefit scheme, it must do so in a matter of compatible with Article 14, subsequently confirmed by the Grand Chamber. However, the present case is distinguishable from the case of Stack for the following reasons. It's true that both the present case and the case of stack concerned non contributory benefits which are partly funded by general taxation. However, while the case of STEC dealt with a supplementary regular payment and a regular retirement pension in the framework of Social Security, the subject of the instant case is a one off grant, one off payment granted as compensation for events which had occurred even before the convention entered into force and represented in a wider sense a settlement of damages caused by the Second World War. The payments were made outside the framework of social security legislation and cannot be likened to the payments in stack. So, my Lord, so far as I'm aware, this is the only post stack case on Article 1 protocol 1 that takes the matter any further forward. But what it makes clear in terms is that Steck was not intended to open the gates on our ambit of Article 1 protocol 1 to any form of state assistance or benefit in whatever form. And in my submission. If the European Court is drawing a distinction between a cash payment made to force labourers in the Second World War and saying, Well, that's outside the confines of STEC, then in my submission it would necessarily follow that a discretion, a scheme with a series of evaluative judgments where the benefit is a benefit in kind would also fall outside. The terms of step is quite right to say there are other issues that arise in the Italian case that don't arise here, and one can say there were a number of factors. One was the fact that the scheme had come into a related to events well before the convention, and the other was that it was a very particular factual situation. But in my submission, it gives the lie to my learned friend Mr Guardian Submission. That step means that any state benefit of whatever form now falls within a one p one, and therefore with an article 6"

p3,01:44:43.750,01:45:16.530,spk_3,"lying there, talking about step and saying that it's for the reason given is in the framework of Social Security, which is plain enough. And it's also plane, I think, almost self evident that the compensation are talking about. There was outside Social Security legislation, the one off thing and really it is symptomatic award. But is the point against you not this that we're dealing here with something that was in is planning within the framework of Social Security legislation"
p3,01:45:16.540,01:45:17.400,spk_2,known

p3,01:45:18.730,01:46:35.210,spk_2,"the meaning of social security. Here, it means wealth. It means social security benefits payments. And in my submission, that's clear from what what they're saying about regular payments, regular retirement pensions. So the distinction there drawing is between what we would in the UK called a social Security scheme. Income support, jobseeker's allowance, disability, living allowance, those kind of things. And in the Italian case, one off payments for effectively compensatory payments. But here equally something in my submission Part seven would certainly not be described as a social security scheme. It would be described as a social welfare scheme, and there's a critical distinction there. Well known both in English law and in European law. Social welfare schemes would cover anything that involves help. I'm going to put it in very non technical terms. But helping the needy in society, Social Security are the financial benefits which the state awards to people who meet the entitlements"
p3,01:46:35.780,01:46:39.620,spk_3,"well, the whole argument, of course, was conditioned by the fact that they were talking about a"
p3,01:46:39.620,01:46:40.470,spk_2,payment.
p3,01:46:40.920,01:47:01.900,spk_3,"And all right, you've got the one off payment and then you've got the scheme which provides for payments. So at one level, the distinction is drawn simply because there was the framework of social security which provided the background Steck, which was absent in this case, Does it take one really any further?"
p3,01:47:02.280,01:47:42.720,spk_2,"I I only rely on it to go this far. The European court here has sought to limit Stack. Now it sought to limit it on the facts of the Italian case. Clearly, Part 7 raises different factual issues, but the European court has said yes, we did this in Stack, but we didn't mean it to go any further than that. And my learned friend Mr Gowdy yesterday suggested to you that the case law on Article 1 protocol 1 assisted him in saying that, Part 7 rights for civil rights for Article 6."
p3,01:47:42.870,01:47:54.690,spk_1,We're not sure of the court in this. Caroline Casey is saying we didn't intend to go any further than we got in today or contrary. We didn't intend to go as far as this case would require us to go.

p3,01:47:56.520,01:47:58.090,spk_1,"So, I mean, if mm,"
p3,01:47:58.780,01:48:00.580,spk_0,I have some difficulty understanding why
p3,01:48:00.580,01:48:19.510,spk_3,"stick was relevant here because what this case was about was the German law, which put into effect the agreement between the United States and Germany for compensation to civilian forced labourers. And the case was decided as far as I can see,"
p3,01:48:19.520,01:48:20.670,spk_0,"ultimately,"
p3,01:48:20.670,01:48:22.680,spk_3,on the simple point that

p3,01:48:23.480,01:48:35.330,spk_3,"extra former prisoners of war didn't have any Article one protocol, one writes, because they weren't included as beneficiaries under that scheme, So why was still relevant?"
p3,01:48:35.340,01:48:37.600,spk_2,"It's a little bit subtler than that, my lord,"
p3,01:48:37.610,01:48:39.400,spk_4,because
p3,01:48:39.410,01:49:27.150,spk_2,"which one needs to be embedded in the case law around STEC and Capecchi. And they undoubtedly didn't have an Article one protocol, one right for the reasons your lordships just given. But the argument that was being advanced in this case, as was advanced in Steck, was I don't need to have the right. I only need to be with within the ambit of Article 1 Protocol one and in order to be within the ambit according to Stack, that the critical test in stack for ambit is but for the condition of entitlement which dis entitles me, I would get the benefit."
p3,01:49:27.160,01:49:27.930,spk_0,"Yes, it's the Article"
p3,01:49:27.930,01:49:30.340,spk_3,14 has to fall within
p3,01:49:30.340,01:49:31.390,spk_0,the purview of the right you
p3,01:49:31.390,01:49:32.490,spk_3,don't actually have to have.
p3,01:49:32.980,01:50:56.280,spk_2,"And if you think if one struggles with it, that is very difficult with a possession, because the whole problem is if I don't meet the condition of entitlement, then of course I can't get the benefit. If I'm not disabled, then of course I can't get disability living allowance. The condition of entitlement is integral to whether or not you have the possession at all. And in the case of Capecchi, which is referred to at length in stack. The test that the European court posited was the but for test and the argument that was run by the UK government in Stack and then again in the House of Lords in RJM was that the but for test simply couldn't be right for Social Security benefits because it meant anybody could claim the benefit, not meet the critical test and then say I fall within the ambit. And that argument was rejected in STEC by the Grand Chamber and was then rejected by the House of Lords in RJM. So that's why step was relevant, My lord, That particular issue happily doesn't need to concern this court today that sets the background. And if Your Lordship me wants to understand that you can see it from the Grand Chamber decision in STEC and indeed the admissibility decision could could I ask"

p3,01:52:43.610,01:54:01.230,spk_2,"the answer, my lady, I could be wrong about this, but I think the answer lies in paragraph 84 may analytically relate back to what we were debating in teetering me, which was the in Voss. If one goes to paragraph 84 of the Italian case, the present case is therefore clearly distinguishable from the case of Voss in which the court held that a compensation scheme under the Polish German Reconciliation Foundation, former forced labourers which is distinct from the system as set out by the foundation law fell within the ambit of Article 60 convention. In that case, the court found that the applicant met the requirements and therefore enjoyed at least unarguable grounds. A right of compensation subsequently confirmed in the court's judgement as the applicants were clearly excluded from benefits under the foundation. Law and compensation for forced labour was only provided recently by the foundation law. The court considers that the applicants could not claim to have had a right of compensation, even unarguable grounds. It follows an article 61 of the convention does not apply to the facts of the present case. So as I understand it, the distinction was that involves they met the conditions of entitlement. They had a right. Therefore, I can't remember the facts of this sufficiently clearly as to whether it has crystallised into a particular amount. Uh"
p3,01:54:01.230,01:54:01.750,spk_0,huh.

p3,01:54:46.040,01:55:00.950,spk_2,"must be right. Because if you if you claimed a social Security benefit and you had no possible, you didn't have a legitimate expectation to it. But you were, it fell within the terms of Salesi. Then you'd be an article 6 territory."

p3,01:55:13.500,01:55:35.320,spk_2,"Yes, And as often in my respectful submission with Strasburg, there may be a consideration of the merits of the case that go to the conclusion. My Lord, I'm sorry. I've taken a long time on those authorities, but your lordships haven't seen them before. And I'm conscious that"
p3,01:55:35.330,01:55:38.070,spk_3,"it's not at all. It's extremely interesting. Yes,"
p3,01:55:38.080,01:56:14.460,spk_2,"it's all historically interesting. If nothing else. So my my lord, in my submission, the Strasbourg case law in respect of civil rights has not progressed any further than that considered by the House of Lords in Bagan and just to touch on Sophia. In this context, Sophia was of course, a case about housing benefit, which is a classic social security scheme, effectively in terms of entitlement very similar to the income support scheme,"
p3,01:56:15.130,01:56:15.510,spk_4,but
p3,01:56:15.510,01:59:23.660,spk_2,"specifically for housing costs. And in Sofia, the UK government didn't contest that Article 61 was engaged and in my submission, very strongly. Contrary to what my learning from Mr Gowdy has said, there is a complete dick contrast for these purposes between the Housing benefit Scheme and rights under Part seven of the Housing Act to housing housing benefit is a cash benefit. It is subject to a precise set of legally hard edged criteria, and once one is entitled, there is an arithmetical calculation as to what one is entitled to in terms of amount. It therefore stands on all falls with Benito, and in my submission, it is utterly different. For the purposes of Article 61 from mhm the part seven rights before I make submissions on part seven. Specifically, Can I just ask your Lordships briefly to look at em in Croydon? In respect of civil rights? Of course, the comments in the opinions are over to there because, uh, your Lordships, tomorrow day after tomorrow, we're going to find against the secretary of state on and against the respondents on domestic point. But both my Lady Hale and Lord Hope did deal with civil rights, albeit briefly. First of all, Lady Hale at paragraph 39 refers to Bagan refers to, uh, the Russian cases and refers to so lazy and then in paragraph 40 um, first to the Russian cases not being based on any argument and then at the bottom of page 24 any entitlement under Section 21 that's the Children Act, which was an issue in that case, does not depend upon discretion. But it does depend upon an evaluation of some very soft criteria rather than specific rules. And it is difficult to say at what point the applicant may consider himself to be the holder of such a right. Hence, as my Lord Walker observed in Rana Begum, if they write, such as this is a civil right at all. It must lie close to the boundary of the concept and not at the core of what it entails. If so, this may have consequences for the second question, which is what Article six requires. And in my submission, the same points would be made here. If you get a right under Part seven, it is subject to some very soft criteria, and I'll come back to that in a moment"
p3,01:59:23.670,01:59:29.970,spk_3,"that's consistent with Strasburg guidance is it? I know we've been saying it, but it's"
p3,01:59:29.970,01:59:39.230,spk_2,"consistent that the soft criteria relates to the discretionary, the evaluative and discretionary terms of the right of entitlement to the right."
p3,01:59:39.240,01:59:43.250,spk_3,"Yes, I follow that. But it's the boundary point."
p3,01:59:43.820,02:06:10.770,spk_2,"Yes, my Lord, I'll come well, the boundary point in my submission all flows back to Brian and taking into account those different criteria on breach. And I'll come to that when I come to breach. But yes, in my submission, what Lord Bingham and Hoffman said in Begum about being on the edge and engagement reflecting on Bridge goes back to Brian. And that, in turn, goes back to Mr Bratt's opinion. Brian, uh, just staying on Croydon for a moment. Uh, paragraph 45 of Lady Hale's opinion. Uh, if this is a civil right at all, therefore I'd be inclined to hold that it rests at the periphery of such rights the same point again. And then, my Lord Lord, hold. Yeah. Who, if I may say so with respect was slightly more definite on the point paragraphs 61 62 mhm 61. I read this passage as an endorsement of the points that passage in Rutabagas We've looked at on a number of occasions that Lord Lord Bingham made in Rana Begum that if an elastic interpretation is given to the Article 61 concept of civil rights, flexibility must also be given to the procedural requirements of that article. If over judicial isation of the administrative welfare scheme is to be avoided. But it is important to to recognise that in Sofia is in room to begin the question. If so, at what point administrative welfare schemes fall outside. The scope of Article 61 was not tested. Sofia, as I've said, fell within the mainstream of cases about social security and welfare benefits in room to begin the House preferred not to take a decision on this issue. 62. There are, however, a number of straws in the wind that has been generated by the decisions from Strasbourg since Reena Begum. That suggests that a distinction can now be made between the class of Social Security and welfare benefits that is of a kind exemplified by so lazy and those benefits which are, in their essence, dependent upon the exercise of judgement by the relevant authority. The phrase civil rights is, of course, an autonomous concepts, the wound room. But it does convey the idea of what in stack the Strasbourg court referred to as an assessor to bill right in that paragraph, having declared that the convention must be read as a whole and interpreted in such a way as to promote internal consistency and harmony between its provisions and in Paragraph 49 that it's in the interest of the convention as a whole, that the autonomous concept of possession in a one P one should be interpreted in a way which is consistent with the concept of pecuniary rights, the court said. And I've already read your lordships. That passage then 63 reference to luas. Oh, to a private right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law and to an individual right of which the applicant may consider him the holder himself. The holder are consistent with this approach. So, too, are the references in Manito to a right, which can be said, at least unarguable grounds to be recognised under domestic law. Where the court added, the dispute must be genuine and serious. It may relate not only to the actual existence of the right to also do its scope and manner of exercise. The outcome. The proceedings must be directly decisive with the writing question cases where the award of benefit is dependent upon a series of evaluative judgments as to whether the statutory criteria are satisfied and, if so, how the need for it has assessed ought to be met. Do not answer that description. The exact limits of the autonomous concept remain elusive. One can be confident that cases where the relationship between the beneficiary, the public authority, is a public law character, as in one room where the role of the applicant associations in regard to the construction and maintenance of public housing was over. Typically, general interest character fall outside the scope Mr Howell submitted. There's no distinction to be drawn between the forms in which welfare benefits may be provided. But none of the Strasbourg authorities goes that far. And the carefully worded passages from Suazo and Stack, to which I have referred, seemed to me to contradict his proposition. The series of cases about the enforcement of judgments made by the courts about social housing in Russia, to which he referred of which the latest is Nogovitsyn, offer no assistance as the question whether a duty to provide social housing gives rise to a civil right was not argued for these reasons. I think it can now be asserted with reasonable confidence that the duty of the local authority under Section 21 of the 1989 to provide accommodation for any child in need within their area who appears to them to require accommodation as a result of the factors mentioned in that subsection does not give rise to a civil right within the meaning of Article 61 of the convention. So my lords, in my submission that comes as close as this house caught in its previous guys was has been prepared to come to what is a civil right? Can I then turn to pull those submissions together in respect of the scheme under Part seven, and just point to what, in my submission, are the three critical elements as to why this isn't a civil right? Firstly, the series of highly evaluative judgments along the way to getting the right and I'll go to those in a second. Secondly, the way the right is met or discharged itself involves discretionary judgments. And thirdly, the circumstances in which the right can be lost or the duty can be discharged involves again highly evaluative judgments. Yeah, so I'm going to take this speedily because your Lordships have already looked at the scheme twice. But in terms of that first heading the series of highly judgmental decisions along the way to getting the right section of the act, of course, is that Volume one tabloid?"
p3,02:06:10.780,02:06:11.400,spk_3,"Yes,"
p3,02:06:11.850,02:06:14.000,spk_2,Section 175.
p3,02:06:14.680,02:06:14.880,spk_0,"Yeah,"
p3,02:06:15.580,02:06:15.810,spk_4,mhm
p3,02:06:16.980,02:06:35.100,spk_2,itself involves a lot of what My Lady Hale described in Croydon as soft criteria. Are you homeless? Under section 275 involves questions about is the accommodation available. Are you entitled to occupy it?
p3,02:06:35.780,02:06:36.010,spk_4,Would
p3,02:06:36.010,02:06:55.100,spk_2,"it be reasonable under 375 3 for you to continue to occupy it, then 176 involves judgments about who normally resides with you and who might reasonably be expected to reside with you."

p3,02:06:58.480,02:07:30.110,spk_2,"177 Whether it's reasonable to continue to occupy accommodation. Yeah, judgments about whether it is probable that doing so will lead to domestic violence, which necessarily is going to involve very sensitive issues of evaluative judgement. To keep saying the same thing and then to skip on to 100 and 89. Are you in priority? Need"
p3,02:07:30.780,02:07:33.900,spk_0,oh
p3,02:07:34.280,02:09:26.900,spk_2,"again involves soft edged criteria under 1891 a. Who might you reasonably be expected to reside with? Are you residing with dependent Children or might be reasonably expected to reside with them? And are you vulnerable as a result of old age section 190 Intentional homelessness? I'm sure anybody who has sat in the administrative court in the days when these cases came before it will realise how very judgmental and how difficult those decisions are, and a whole series of judgements have to be made as to whether somebody's homeless, intentionally or not. Now, my lords, I don't want to be put to Hi. I'm not suggesting that you can get in Social Security schemes, eh? Value some evaluative judgments. Was it reasonable for you to take a job in jobseekers allowance? So I'm not saying that these are knockout points individually, but in terms of, do you even get the right? This is a very soft edge set of criteria where there's a great scope for professional judgement all along the way. But the second point, it is in my submission, one that does differ starkly from social security schemes because that involves the way the right is met itself involves a high level of discretion. So the duty under section 1932 is simply to secure. Accommodation is available for occupation by the applicant."
p3,02:09:28.070,02:09:33.090,spk_3,It's indefinite article. Is it? You say that that accommodation?
p3,02:09:34.070,02:09:34.730,spk_2,Yes.
p3,02:09:35.030,02:09:38.900,spk_3,I'm just trying to get what the point is you're taking from that very short subsection.
p3,02:09:39.430,02:12:24.970,spk_2,"No. The point is, all that has to be done is to secure accommodation. It doesn't say the form of the accommodation. It doesn't say the tenure of the accommodation. It doesn't say the location of the 10th of the accommodation. All those are matters of judgement for the local authority and in my submission that is in very stark contrast to housing benefit in Sofia or to the disability benefit in Veneto, which are simply arithmetical calculations on the financial benefit that accrues once you've got your entitlement, Then the decision makers simply talks up the elements. And that's in total contrast in my submission to the nature of the duty and how it's discharged in section 1932 and then The third contrast, which again, in my submission, is very great to any social security scheme is the way the duty can be discharged in 1935 and 75. The local housing authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequences of refusal and of his right to review to request a review, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged under that having discharged their duty under this section and then seven. The local housing authority should also cease to be subject to a duty under this section if the applicant, having been informed of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses a final offer of accommodation under part six. So, my lords, under this scheme, the right is lost. Yeah, if the view is taken that there has been an offer of accommodation which was suitable for him, and that necessarily involves a huge element of judgement discretion. However, you want to put it as to whether a suitable offer was made. There is no equivalent to that in housing benefit. For example, you can only lose your housing benefit if you cease to be entitled because you no longer meet the hard edged criteria. Part seven is completely different."
p3,02:12:27.250,02:12:45.910,spk_1,"Can I? I don't think it makes anything, but I just my satisfaction part Part six final offer is likely to be better and more permanent housing than then. Maybe so under part seven. Otherwise under part seven. In other words, under 1935, I"
p3,02:12:45.920,02:12:48.660,spk_2,"believe that's right. Yes, yes,"
p3,02:12:51.450,02:12:55.980,spk_3,is part six more precise about what it means by accommodation for that purpose.
p3,02:12:58.250,02:13:02.270,spk_1,"I'm cost six. You know, you get you get a permanent place."
p3,02:13:03.450,02:13:11.480,spk_2,"I believe that's right, my lord. Unless you fall into the category of an introductory tenancy."
p3,02:13:11.850,02:13:12.170,spk_0,Mhm.
p3,02:13:15.450,02:13:20.040,spk_2,But I have to come back to your lordships as to how the statutory provisions
p3,02:13:20.050,02:13:29.520,spk_1,"I was just trying to understand the interrelation between six and seven. We looked at yesterday. I think I'm more or less,"
p3,02:13:30.150,02:14:54.160,spk_2,"my lord, I'll check that over lunch and come back because I don't want to speculate and get it wrong. So, my lords, in my submission, for all those reasons we see a scheme under part seven, which is, although the duty itself is not subject to the discretion and as much as once you have the right section 1935 puts a duty on the local authority not a power. But whether you get the right precisely, the forms of the right, and how you lose the right to highly judgmental, starkly contrasted with anything that the European Court has found falls within Article 61 and then finally on engagement. My Lord, My Lords, I do want to stress the point that was made very strongly in Croydon. If Article 61 is engaged by a claim under Part seven, then it is very difficult to see why it would not also be engaged by a series of other local authority decisions in the area of welfare. And the most obvious ones are those under the National Assistance Act"

p3,02:15:14.840,02:15:37.670,spk_2,"certain number of hours per week assistance, certain changes to their accommodation, a whole series of other matters. Social services assistance under the National Assistance Act and other social services statutes. In my submission, it would be impossible to draw a line between that and part seven. Now"
p3,02:15:38.440,02:15:38.580,spk_4,that
p3,02:15:38.580,02:16:20.360,spk_2,"might in policy terms. Some might see that as beneficial because those are all terribly important things to the people who get those rights. But it is important to emphasis, as was in Croydon, the huge scope of this argument in terms of expanding civil rights beyond social security into social welfare schemes, where there are discretionary judgments as to what rights you get. But once you've got them, you then have a right and the local authority. Or in some cases the central government would have a duty to provide."
p3,02:16:20.370,02:16:23.740,spk_3,There are probably writes a review. Most of those decisions of some sort.
p3,02:16:23.750,02:17:01.490,spk_2,"Well, my lord, probably not. Certainly not decisions under the National Assistance Act. No, they are only subject to administrative to judicial review. Yes, so they're all subject to judicial review. This is subject to Section 24, but none of them are subject to a full fact finding review. As Mr Gowdy argues for here, yes, there are no subject to national security. There are no administrative decisions effectively in England, which aren't in some way subject to judicial review, but they're not. There is no fact finding tribunal for decisions under the National Assistance Act."
p3,02:17:01.500,02:17:09.599,spk_4,The only example I can think of and will be somebody who can correct me if I'm wrong of

But the closest example of what would be required is sending yes and now the first of the social entitlement social entitlement in something else. But that's the only example I can think of.

p3,02:18:07.660,02:18:22.650,spk_2,"Absolutely. And indeed, I remember some years ago appearing before Your Ladyship in the Court of Appeal on a case where your leadership pointed out with some force to my opponent that, in fact, in terms of legal rights, Children with special educational needs were in a rather fortunate position. I'm"
p3,02:18:22.650,02:18:23.410,spk_4,"afraid I did,"
p3,02:18:24.820,02:19:24.940,spk_2,"um, because in contrast to elderly people or vulnerable adults who are relying on the National Assistance Act, special educational kids with special educational needs do have that fact finding jurisdiction. But this my learning friends arguments would leave no clear distinction between national Assistance Act assistance and also potentially with a number of education decisions, both in respect of grants but also potentially in respect of education rights themselves. And of course, it will always be an incremental process. And at each stage, I expect the local authority and possibly the secretary of state will turn up and say, this is a step too far. But at the moment we have a clear line in Strasbourg and once benefits in kind under part seven, with all the evaluative elements I've referred to fall in the clear line completely disappeared. Yeah, yes. Um,"

And that is the very close relationship between the issue issues one and issues,"
p3,02:19:49.540,02:19:50.250,spk_4,too.
p3,02:19:51.610,02:20:46.720,spk_2,"In my submission, if Article six is engaged here, in other words, if it is a civil right, then it is absolutely on the borderline or on the periphery of what is a civil right, and that gives clear indications of the approach that should be taken to whether or not there's a breach of Article six, in other words, to whether or not there is a requirement for a full fact finding appeal mechanism and your lordships have already seen the references in Begum. If I just refer to the paragraphs Lord Bingham made this point of paragraph five and Lord Hoffman at paragraph 34. And, um, as we've seen a moment ago, my Lord Hope Lady Hale made the same point in Croydon."

p3,02:21:30.710,02:21:56.820,spk_2,"Well, my lord, there's a just a point on Brian that your lordships need to note what your lordships have got. A tab 36 is the court judgement, but what unfortunately has been missed out of that is the consideration of Mr Brat, sir. Which Labour? Who at that stage was the advocate? General? No sorrows on the commission on court. Um,"

p3,02:22:08.050,02:22:41.830,spk_2,"that is critical for those members of this court who haven't been around this block at least 10 times. Because when Lord Hoffman in Alconbury makes extensive reference to Brian, most of what he's referring to is actually Mr Bratt's concurring opinion.

Yeah, And just before I go to the concurring opinion and Brian in my submission, the thrust of understanding Article 61 breach and where my learned friend Mr Gowdy goes wrong is that what the European Court is saying is you can't cherry pick one of those factors. And so because of that, there has to be a full fact decision. You have to see the thing holistically and look at all of the factors if we go to the full report in Brian, The opinion of the commission starts at page 351. And then the concurring opinion of Mr Brat, sir, at page 353. Mhm, Yeah,"
p3,02:24:48.190,02:24:48.510,spk_4,mhm.
p3,02:24:49.490,02:26:37.710,spk_2,"But And if I just read that through maybe the most efficient I share the view of the majority of the commission that on the fact the present case the only challenge the enforcement notice which the applicant pursued in the high court related to matters of planning policy and that consistently with the court's reasoning in the table case Article six does not in any event require that a court should have the power to substitute its view for that of the administrative authorities on matters of planning, policy or expediency. It is said that the reason why the absent did not pursue his appeal underground B of Section 1742 may have been the fact that the court's powers review were too limited to justify pursuing the appeal. If we can stop there and I can try and explain the planning law that goes behind that, Brian was an enforcement case and the relevant power of appeal against an enforcement notice at Ground A was that you should get planning permission so that necessarily involved considering planning policy. But ground be is that the sorry is a ground which necessarily involves considering the facts because it involves the question Underground B is whether there has been a breach of planning control. So it is not a question, actually, of planning policy. It's a question of considering the particular facts of the case, and one can see that from paragraph 10 of the Brian decision going back"

However, I also find that there has been no violation of Article six in the present case on the broader ground that the powers of review in the High Court, under Section 289 of the act, are sufficiently wide to satisfy the requirement held by the court to be inherent in Article six that the judicial body determining the applicant civil rights and obligations should have full jurisdiction and just to stop there. The Section 289 power is effectively the same as judicial review. The section that same as section 204. It's appealing point of"

p3,02:28:36.670,02:29:34.780,spk_2,"it appears to me that the requirement that a court or tribunal should have full jurisdiction cannot be mechanically applied, with the result that in all circumstances and whatever the subject matter of the dispute, the court or tribunal must have full power to substitute its own findings of fact and its own inferences from those facts for that of the administrative authority concerned. Whether the power of judicial review is sufficiently wide to satisfy the requirements of Article six must, in my view, depend on a number of considerations, including the subject matter of the dispute, the nature of the decision of the administrative authorities, which is in question the procedure, if any, which exists for review of the decision by a personal body acting independently of the authority concerned and the scope of that power of review. In my view, the powers of review of the High Court, when combined with the statutory arrangements under the 1990 Act for appealing against an enforcement notice, satisfy the requirements of Article 61, and it's that passage which then finds its way into the court judgement at paragraph 45."

The extent to which it had to be able to review questions of fact did not arise to decide that question. It is necessary to have another look at Bryan, and then what you do is you go back to Bryan, and as my Lord, Lord Browne will certainly know, one of the critical points about an enforcement notice appeal in the planning context is that once the facts have been found and the notice is upheld, then a breach of the enforcement notice gives rise to criminal prosecutions. Yes. And in accordance with the case of Crown against Wicks, it is not open on the Magistrates Court or the Crown Court on the criminal prosecution to reopen the findings of fact. And what Lord Hoffman said in Begum, going on into 41 and 42 is that in that context, findings of fact in Bryan were incredibly important and required particular safeguards. And that comes back into my submission about you need to look at all these factors together because the reason why in Bryan you needed the safeguards wasn't just because it was a question of fact. It was because of what flowed from the decision-making process, which was potentially a criminal prosecution, where your defence had already been undermined by the findings of fact. And that's what Lord Hoffman says at paragraphs 41 and 42 of Begum."
p4,00:04:40.440,00:04:44.950,spk_0,"Well, thank you very much indeed. That's set my mind at rest. My lord."
p4,00:04:46.440,00:07:49.790,spk_1,"And then my Lord dealing, going on to deal with breach. What I'm going to do is make a few general points but trying not to cover ground covered by Mr Arden. Then I'm going to deal with the Tsfayo and Crompton, Crompton briefly but Tsfayo in a little more detail because Mr Arden didn't do so. And then I'm going to conclude by just making submissions about those Bryan factors and how they apply to this case. So in terms of the general points, as I said, I'll take it quickly. First of all, in my submission, the issues in the present case were decided in Begum. Although Begum concerned a challenge to a finding on suitability of the accommodation offered, the decision was at the House of Lords was quite explicitly not limited to where cases where the issue was one of judgement alone. And the argument being advanced today by my learned friend Mr Goudie was rejected in terms in my submission in Begum and the references are Lord Bingham at paragraph 10 and Lord Hoffman at paragraph 58. So, in my submission, where that leaves us is either can one draw a distinction on the facts of this case and or do Tsfayo and Crompton force this court to depart from the House of Lords decision in Begum. Dealing with the first of those can one somehow draw a distinction on the facts? In my submission, the answers that plainly has to be no. Part seven of the Housing Act decisions are based on a complicated nexus of facts and judgments, and some of what might be called simple facts then lead into difficult judgments. So there might be facts about whether the lifts work regularly in a block. And that's a classically simple question of fact. How often in the last six months of these lifts broken? It may be critical then to the question as to whether the accommodation is suitable for somebody with two small children who has to carry them up the stairs. Those are exactly the kind of issues that do arise in suitability cases, and in my submission, it is completely unrealistic to try to divide up these issues into fact issues and judgement issues. And to go that way in my submission is to invite absolute chaos and I say that with care in my submission that is not too high absolute chaos in the county court, where some poor judge has to try to make these distinctions."
p4,00:07:50.840,00:08:08.880,spk_0,"I don't think there's much doubt that people would accept that when you're talking about whether the lifts work, to decide whether something is suitable, that is it possible to isolate the kind of issue we've got here, which is a sort of make or break point as to whether or not the duty has been discharged on receipt of a letter?"
p4,00:08:09.050,00:09:06.660,spk_1,"Well, my Lord, firstly, in my submission, my learned friend has been utterly unclear, perhaps deliberately unclear on what findings of fact he says this approach would apply to. Now at some points in his submissions, he suggested it was facts that did not require specialist expertise, and one can see that the lift breaking would fall into that category, but they would be part of the nexus of suitability. At one point, he suggested in my submission, partly from the prompting of my Lord, Lord Browne, that it might be facts which could be said not to be staging posts. So can you draw certain facts away discreetly and say, well, those become facts which have to be amenable to a full fact-finding jurisdiction. Now,"
p4,00:09:07.640,00:09:08.150,spk_3,[background noise]
p4,00:09:08.740,00:09:40.460,spk_1,"There are two points to make on that. One is generally, that distinction will be very difficult to draw. Um. The only way that it could perhaps be argued is to say, well, there's this one very distinct issue about did you get the letter or not? But in my submission, even that doesn't work, because if you look at section 1935 in Volume one tab one"
p4,00:09:41.240,00:09:41.740,spk_0,the
p4,00:09:41.740,00:12:40.640,spk_1,"local authority Housing Authority shall cease to be subject to the duty under this section. If the applicant, having been informed by the authority of the possible consequence of refusal and of his right to request a review of the suitability of the accommodation, refuses an offer of accommodation which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him, and the authority notify him, that they regard themselves after having discharged their duty under this section. Now, the first point to make is an obvious one. Unlike Section 20 of the Children Act, the section, subsection 1935 doesn't distinguish between different limbs that might be said, we're not talking about domestic precedent fact here, but that might be said within Article 6 terms, somehow to be discreet questions of fact. You can see that even within section 1935, there are certain things that might be argued by lawyers to be discreet. Have you been informed? Did you get the letter? Have you been informed of the possible consequence of refusal? Now, is that a discreet fact? Or is that a judgement? In other words, that becomes: was the letter good enough? So you got the letter that's not in dispute. But you say that this letter didn't tell me about the possible consequence of refusal. This letter missed the point. So is that a discreet question of fact? And then, very similarly of his right to request a review of the suitability, was that sufficiently clear? And then the next bit is if the applicant refuses an offer of accommodation, well, you can see that that could be analysed as a question of fact. Did your letter back refuse the offer, or was it more equivocal? One can see, in particular cases that might arise, and then which the authority are satisfied is suitable for him. Well, I think everybody would agree that was a judgement call and the authority notify him that they regard themselves as having discharged their duty. Well again. That could be: Did you get the letter? But it could also be questions within the letter as to whether it was clear or not. So, my Lord, in my submission, attempts to try to divide off one particular factual, inverted commas, issue only is going to give rise to a domino effect of other potential factual issues that could be argued to be discreet or in a non domestic sense conditions precedent. So in my submission, the statutory scheme, statutory words do not at all support an analysis that there are discrete questions of fact which can be wholly divorced from the rest of the part seven decision."
p4,00:12:40.650,00:12:47.260,spk_2,Out of interest. Is there anything which actually dictates that these various bits of information have to build notifications have to be in writing?

If you fall into 1937, then it does 7A if it's made in writing but that relates to a part 6 offer now my learned friend tells me that in many of these cases there will be part 6 offer as well as part 7 offers. But there's nothing specifically as far as I could see, because I did try and check this point. As far as I can see, there was nothing specifically in relation to Part 7 offers under 1935 that requires them to be in writing. And there's certainly nothing that there's no statutory form. There's no specific letter or form or whatever laid down so in my submission"

p4,00:13:39.130,00:13:53.730,spk_1,statutory scheme doesn't support this submission at all. I do also submit that it is relevant that this is not the way that Mr. Goudie has ever put this case as I understand it before the promptings of yesterday.

[laughing] Mrs, This submission was completely contrary to what was being argued in Tomlinson and I went back and checked the skeleton arguments and the judgement from the Court of Appeal, and there was no suggestion that it was being said that there were quite different issues around Ali and Ibrahim from these around Tomlinson. It is also relevant in my submission, and goes to the statutory scheme that for Mr. Goudie to win on this point would be what I would describe as a very pyrrhic victory because it's a very narrow point where in most cases I would suggest that's not going to be the issue that is arising between the individual and the housing authority. It's not going to be, I did get the letter or I didn't get the letter. It's going to be about suitability and issues around that. And then, of course, even if in many cases that very narrow issue about whether you got the letter or not is found in the claimant's favour, it still often won't answer the dispute because then they may well go on to be arguments about suitability.

p4,00:16:04.880,00:17:20.680,spk_3,"points that was very powerful in the Croydon case in distinguishing the Children Act from the approach in Paul Hofer and the homelessness cases was that the Children Act did not say if the local authority is satisfied that a person is a child. It had said that in previous or words to that effect, or somebody who appeared to the local authority to be a child in a previous version of the legislation. But it didn't say that in the 1989 Act. Now one of the points about part 7 is that all the way through it says if the local authority is satisfied, if the local authority is satisfied about almost everything, suitability, homelessness this that and the other which suggests, of course, that a deliberate decision has been taken as to who is to be the fact finder in these cases. To what extent is that relevant to what we have, its relevant to the argument that Lord Browne raised about: What's the difference between this case and Croydon. I'm not sure that it's relevant at all to the Article 6 point."
p4,00:17:20.730,00:17:50.170,spk_1,"It's relevant to the civil right point, my Lady, because it shows a highly discretionary scheme, a highly judgmental scheme, can I say? And it shows that the judgments are given to the decision maker, as was considered by Lord Hoffmann in Begum about social welfare schemes. I suppose the point that would be made against me is that in 1935, it doesn't specifically say if, in the opinion of the local housing authority, the letter was received, but then you wouldn't expect it"

p4,00:17:51.380,00:18:44.610,spk_1,"That is really my point about 1935. It's a totality. You read it together and those are all issues that run together, whereas in Croydon on the interpretation of the Children Act, one could see the argument that child was a separate issue where there were lots of judgments in the scheme for the local authority, and there was no suggestion that the decision on whether somebody was a child was expressly for the local authority. But here, the issue of whether you get the letter hasn't been divided off into some separate section or some separate subsection. There's nothing on the statutory scheme that would suggest that that was the right approach. And indeed it ends up with a really illogicality that you have this one matter, which is subject to full fact finding. And then everything else is subject to Section 204 point of law."
p4,00:18:44.620,00:18:54.720,spk_0,"You can look at subsection six, I think as well, because looking at six a, for example, in six B, I think you would say these involve elements of judgement as well as to whether or not"
p4,00:18:54.720,00:18:55.170,spk_1,Absolutely.
p4,00:18:55.840,00:19:17.790,spk_0,"Those tests for ceasing to be subject to the duty as well. So it's a very odd picture if one has some grounds ceasing to be subject to the duty, which are entirely within the judgmental area for the local authority and then others where there's little bits and pieces in a composite package which had to be picked out and sent somewhere else. It's very untidy, if that is the result."
p4,00:19:17.800,00:20:20.870,spk_1,"It's extremely untidy, my Lord, and the point I was making about Subsection 5 is that my learned friend Mr Goudie has focused in on the did you get the letter, but there are other parts of 1935 where you could argue they were questions of pure fact. And the poor old County Court judge is going to have to try to decide which side of the line each part falls on. And my learned friends the only answer to that is to say, well, that's simple enough you look at the pleadings. But, my lords, in my submission, that is a very unrealistic approach to suggest that pleadings in a public law matter at the County Court level are going to be so precise that the judge can confidently say, Well, that's a full fact-finder under Article 6 and that's a judicial review section 204 point of law. It's not at all fanciful in my submission to suggest all that you will get is a whole series of appeals to the Court of Appeal saying that the judges fell on the wrong side of the line."
p4,00:20:20.880,00:20:33.560,spk_0,"That's precisely the situation we're in in Begum, isn't it? Because she said she had been attacked by two youths and on that hypothesis, it would be a pure question of fact to be taken separately and decided."
p4,00:20:33.560,00:22:54.680,spk_1,"Well, I think that's why I said Mr. Goudie was very unclear as to what he was saying was a pure question of fact, because on one of his submissions yesterday, he would have accepted that that was a stepping stone on the way to suitability and therefore that would fall outside his pure question of fact. It's not clear to me where he says that the line would be drawn because clearly, have you been attacked, like does the lift work is a question of fact that ultimately can be determined by a jury. It doesn't need professional expertise. It's that kind of question of fact. On the test he posited yesterday about: Is it is it a fact that requires specialist expertise? The answer has to be no. So in my submission, all you get to from Mr. Goudie's submissions on this is it is an extremely untidy line which will has no basis in the statutory scheme whatsoever and which inevitably will just give rise to huge amounts of litigation. Well, if Article 6 forced that, then so be it. But in my submission, Article 6 clearly doesn't force that. And while remaining on this point about what is a question of fact, in my submission, the other aspect of this is to emphasise the scope of Mr. Goudie's argument here. Because if this court was to accept that questions of fact had to be dealt with by a full fact-finding tribunal, then that has implications that goes way, way beyond Part 7 in this case, and it starts to unscramble cases back to Alconbury because, of course, many planning cases and licensing cases, whatever, will involve pure questions of fact. And sometimes they'll involve them as what could be described as conditions precedent. So I just thought of one example over lunch. Listed buildings. Does do the works fall within the curtilage of the listed building? Curt. That's a question of fact. Ultimately, you have to have judgement. But a question of fact Does that then become something that the High Court, on a Section 288 appeal has to consider as a primary facet-finder. One can see there's a huge. There"

p4,00:22:57.360,00:24:42.540,spk_1,"When Your Ladyship applied for an extension. Yes. Yes. But I think in a judicial capacity, it's not something that the administrative Court would thank this court for. The point I make is that this argument goes, well, well beyond Part 7 of the Housing Act and could be replicated across the field of public law where the law has been settled since Alconbury that those are not decisions that need a full fact-finding jurisdiction. Then the final point I'd like to make before I come to Tsfayo is just to stress the point that Mr Arden made, which is that it is necessary for this court to look at the scheme as a whole and not to focus down holy on the individual dispute. And the authority for that is, of course, Wright in the House of Lords and the speech of Lady Hale. And I do rely on that because effectively, the government lost in right because rather than looking at the individual facts and whether there was a breach of Article 6 or a breach of Article 8 on the individual facts, the approach of the House of Lords was to say no, you've got to look at the scheme and if you look at the scheme, it's not compatible. Well, if that applied in right against the government, it must apply here in our favour, in terms of looking not at one factual dispute buried within 1935 but at the nature of the scheme as a whole. So I come then to whether or not Tsfayo and Crompton force this court to depart from Begum and the settled position.

p4,00:25:08.540,00:31:11.530,spk_1,"Following on from the submissions I've already made about how one has to look at those Bryan Criteria or those Bryan considerations holistically and together, not separately. In my submission, one has to read the passage in Tsfayo together. What the European court is saying is that if you put these factors together, you get a breach of Article 61. It's not saying each of these factors on their own would necessarily lead to a breach of Article 6. And when, if one just goes to the end of 45, there's consideration of Runa Begum there and in the last sentence, any significant depart from the procedural rules would have afforded a ground of appeal and then the first sentence of 46, the court considers the decision making process in the present case was significantly different and then there are two aspects in which the decision-making process was significantly different. First of all, the aspect in Paragraph 46 which is that the issues raised in Begum and Bryan required professional knowledge of an or expertise, whereas the issues decided by a Housing Benefit review board was a simple question of fact. That was one difference, and then the other difference was in 47. Now my just dealing with 46 first, my learned friend Mr Goudie says, oh, but if there was a breach, Housing Benefit Review boards had all feelings and rights to representation, so if there was a breach there, then that would suggest that the position must be worse under Part 7. But in my submission that does slightly involve taking the perspective of an English lawyer. Strasbourg does not place the same reliance oral hearings as do most of us, probably normally. And what they're saying in 46 and 47 is that Begum had the greater procedural protection precisely because of the impartiality problems that arise on the Housing Benefit Review board. So it's just not like to read 46 47 to suggest that the housing that the European court were thinking well, even though there's all these procedural protections in the Housing Benefit Review board, there's still a problem, ergo under Part seven there would be less of a problem. That isn't the approach the European court have taken at all. And when they talk in 46 about the facts and the good cause being a housing benefit review board deciding a simple question of fact. The contrast there is with the kind of policy decisions which are inherent in the schemes in Bryan and Runa Begum as opposed to the kind of decisions being made under the Housing Benefit Review Board in this particular case, good cause. So Bryan and Begum schemes, replete with policy and judgmental questions and, of course, self evidently, this case is exactly the same as Runa Begum, whereas a Housing Benefit Review board was not a board, not a decision-maker that required any specialist expertise. See the top of page 471. No specialist expertise required to determine this issue, which is under the new system, determined by a non-specialist tribunal. And that's a a factually quite important point about Tsfayo. That, of course, by the time Tsfayo got to the European court effectively paths had been. I was about to say paths has been sold, but the position has been accepted by the UK government because the new housing benefit has been pulled in under the old Social Security Appeal tribunal system. So the anomaly which had existed for years of counsellors deciding housing benefit issues which were exactly the same in many cases as the income support issues, had been swept away. So that's paragraph 46. But it is then important to focus also on paragraph 47. Because 47 is all about impartiality. It's not about independence. The problem was that the European court felt that these counsellors were not impartial. Last sentence of 47. The safeguards built into the housing benefit review procedure were not adequate to overcome this fundamental lack of objective impartiality. Now, whether they were right or wrong in that approach to counsellors isn't really the issue. What matters is that that's what Strasbourg was thinking about and self, evidently by their support for Runa Begum, they did not think that officers of local authorities suffered from the same difficulty. And to some degree, your lordships relationship don't need to grapple with all this today. But in my submission that the approach of the Strasbourg court is not unreasonable on this because contrary to what Mr Goudie said, local authority members and local authority officers are not in the same position. Members are politically accountable, democratically accountable and are associated very closely with the local authority. They are the political limb of the local authority. Whereas employees, we went through this at great length in Croyden, subject to employment contracts. They are neither legally nor in terms of public perception associated with the local authority in the same way that counsellors would be. And they also have their professional expertise to give them the training and the impartiality which might not to be so true"

p4,00:31:12.550,00:31:34.660,spk_1,And it is in my submission. It's very dangerous here to allow consideration of independence to start merging into impartiality. Mr Goudie has never made his submissions in this case on impartiality. His case is entirely clear. His written case. What's the objection

I mean, I have always assumed that underneath all that there must be some, the two must merge at some point, I agree. But they are very clearly analysed as being separate issues in the case law. You can see. You can be"

p4,00:33:03.080,00:33:49.080,spk_1,"There's no doubt at all that you can be not independent and wholly impartial. And I think to me the easiest example of that is the planning inspector who, for completely structural reasons, is not independent of the executive but has a whole gamut of safeguards for impartiality, which were discussed in Bryan and then in Alconbury. Uh, I think with respect the difficulty that Lord Browne is struggling with is one that I share underneath all that concern about independence must ultimately be that if you are not independent, there is some doubt about your ability to make a holy arm's length decision. Well, it's all water under the bridge"

p4,00:34:51.440,00:34:51.770,spk_1,it's not so easy
p4,00:34:51.770,00:34:56.100,spk_3,for that to deal with the lack of apparent partiality. A similar point to the one that
p4,00:34:58.040,00:34:58.210,spk_1,that
p4,00:34:58.210,00:35:01.360,spk_3,"my Lord is making. Yes,"
p4,00:35:02.340,00:38:04.240,spk_1,"but the answer here is to some degree easier than the answer in Croydon, because my learned friend has not put his case on the basis of impartiality as it was put in Croydon. And in Croydon there was reams of evidence and case law and submissions on why local authority officers should not be considered to be partial, why they were genuinely impartial. And if that was the point, the case that was being made, then there are extensive arguments that can be made against it. Here, the allegation of breach of Article 61 that until all submissions Mr. Goudie was plainly making was only about independence. Now, if they now start to stray into impartiality, then in my submission, the answer to that lies in Croydon, where the issue was dealt with. Um, and if I ask, your Lordship and your ladyship to take up the opinion Lady Hale's opinion employed at paragraph 44. Dealing with alleged. It starts at 43. I'm sorry. Where Mr. Howell argues, that social workers deciding upon Section 20 claims cannot be impartial because they are employed by an authority with a direct financial interest in the outcome. Well, the argument here, if it was about impartiality, would be exactly the same. And then Lady Hale says at paragraph 44 I would be most reluctant to accept and driven by Strasbourg authority to do so that Article six requires the judicialisation of claims to welfare services of this kind. Unlike the arguments based upon statutory construction and jurisdictional fact, Mr Howell's argument cannot sensibly distinguish between the determination of age and the determination of other criteria of entitlement. Every decision about the provision of welfare services has resource implications for the public authority providing the services. Public authorities exist to serve the public. They do so by raising and spending public money. If the office's making the decisions cannot be regarded as impartial, and the problem cannot be cured by the ordinary processes of judicial review based upon the usual criteria of legality, fairness and reasonableness or rationality, then tribunals will have to be set up to determine the merits of claims to Children's services, adult social services, education services and many more. Resources which might be spent on the services themselves be diverted to the decision-making process. Such a conclusion would be difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with Begum. The degree of judicialisation required of an administrative decision in the view of Lord Hoffman in Alconbury, depends upon the nature of the decision. Now in my submission, the passage in the middle of that paragraph about the role of local authority officers and of local authorities applies in exactly the same way here. The officers have no financial interest. The local authority is there, as my learned friend, Mr Arden said, to provide housing. I mean, I'm. Are you setting"

It could perfectly well be a ordinary lay. There was no reason in Tsfayo or in Crompton for it not being a non-specialist tribunal, and therefore that may have fed into the view on Article six.

Although, of"

Ah, in Alconbury. Yes. So that the sequence was Alconbury, Burie, Begum. And at the after Alconbury, there was a great deal of discussion at the English Administrative Law Bar about what did Lord Hoffmann mean by safeguards? What safeguards did you need? And everybody was thinking you needed something like a planning inspector. And that was the point where Mr Justice Moses made the decision in Burie. Then Lord Hoffmann came along in Begum and said, Well, sorry, that was a bit of an unguarded comment and the position changed. Now, that's not to suggest that Strasbourg was unduly influenced by Burie, but it does perhaps explain Mr Justice Moses' comments there on Alconbury. Yes."

Nor could the factual findings in Tsfayo be said to be merely incidental to the reaching of border judgments of policy or expediency, which it was for the democratically accountable authority to take. So those are clear distinctions in Crompton from Tsfayo. It's when they go on to say"
p4,00:44:16.250,00:44:35.000,spk_0,"accordingly, without mentioning the impartiality point, that gives rise to the argument that if it's not specialist and it's factual, then it requires the court to determine it."
p4,00:44:36.390,00:47:23.290,spk_1,"Well, my lord, those are the issues that arose in Crompton. And so perhaps to that degree, it's not surprising they didn't make very much of Paragraph 47. But even taking Crompton on its own terms, in my submission, the critical point about 73 which then comes up in 77 is that it was a decision-making structure where there was no need at all for professional expertise and where the decisions that had to be made: what's the amount of your redundancy compensation, were factual decisions rather than judgmental ones, which have effectively turned on adding up what you thought the entitlement was. And when one comes to 77, I won't read through the first part of it again, but you come on the second page about Line five. Accordingly, there was no compelling reason for the decision on the level of compensation to have been made by the Army board rather than by an independent and impartial tribunal. In this respect, therefore, the court considers that circumstances are similar to those in Tsfayo. So what we were looking at was a scheme that didn't require that didn't involve the policy, stroke, expediency, issues that were part and parcel of Bryan and then part and parcel of Begum. So that's the distinction that was being drawn there. And in my submission there's nothing in Crompton that casts any doubt whatsoever on the analysis in Begum. Because of that distinction about the nature of the schemes. Clearly, all that the European court in Crompton thought it was doing was following that part of Tsfayo. And what what is so interesting about Crompton is that if one then goes on to 78 it brings home that again, you have to look at the matter holistically and all those different Bryan elements, because actually there was no breach in Compton because because of the nature of the decision that was being being made and because of the scope of the High Court, in respect of that particular decision, there was no breach. So that's one of the factors that has to be pulled in there. So for those reasons, in my submission, neither Crompton nor"

Can I then just conclude on breach by going through those the various criteria or the various considerations is better than criteria? I'm going to do this quickly because it's in our in my written case and to some degree just pulling together what I've already said. First of all, looking at the subject matter of the decision. This is a case which, at its highest, is on the periphery of being a civil right. Secondly, as was said in Runa Begum, it is a highly policy-driven scheme replete with evaluative judgments. And thirdly, it involves what Lord Hoffman described as a classic exercise of administrative discretion. So those are the factors in subject matter of the decision,"
p4,00:48:23.870,00:48:31.400,spk_0,and and how do you identify the scope of the subject matter? Do you look at the subsection five or you're looking more broadly than that?
p4,00:48:32.170,00:48:35.350,spk_1,"My lord, at this stage, you look at the broader approach"
p4,00:48:35.770,00:48:36.040,spk_2,Yes.
p4,00:48:36.050,00:48:43.190,spk_1,You look at part seven and the subject matter of the decision as a whole.

Um, that's subject to Section 206, which says that the accommodation has got to be suitable. So you're not just looking at section 1935, you're looking at bits that are elsewhere in the scheme"
p4,00:49:11.770,00:52:08.210,spk_1,"It all has to come together. Then you look at the nature of the issues that arise and the issues that arise under this scheme are those that in general require professional judgement and expertise. Looking at the scheme as a whole, it is not a scheme where there are simple questions of fact that lead to the end conclusion, like Minnetto or Tsfayo. And yes, there may be factual disputes in there. But that's part of the decision-making process, which requires the professional judgments. And then you look at the content of the dispute itself here. The alleged breach of Article six is that the reviewing officer is not independent. That is exactly the same as the argument in Runa Begum. It is in contrast to the argument in Tsfayo, but also to put it in the context of the case law. It's in contrast with a case like Wright where the court may remember that in Wright, the alleged breach of Article six or well the found breach of Article six was a complete denial of any right to make representations. So you, and the consequence of that decision, was that the person usually less lost their job, not always but on the fact that was very often going to be the result. So you've got a major departure from the principles of a fair trial, fair hearing combined with the very draconian consequence. Whereas here, you've got structural ind, lack of independence. But in terms of that breach and the consequences of that breach, nobody suggested the consequences aren't serious, but they're not in article six terms, the same as losing your job. Because of the. I'm sorry, I should explain that I'm getting into shorthand at this stage. Because that is such a clear attack on your private law rights. The consequence in Wright. You have a private contract of employment and that had to be terminated by statutory process if you were put on the provisional list. So that is an absolutely classic central civil right that has just been interfered with. Whereas here, we are on the absolute edge of a Part 7 right and whether they are Article six rights at all. So you can see the way all these issues intermesh in each other"
p4,00:52:08.380,00:52:15.940,spk_0,Is the fact that you could apply again have a part to play in this? Or was that really just something left best left out of the fact?
p4,00:52:15.950,00:54:52.840,spk_1,"Well, my lord, the if it has a part to play, my submission, to be fair, would be that it's probably a relatively small part to play because it seems that you can only apply, your application is only likely to be seriously considered if there's been a material change of circumstance. And if you simply stick in another application on the grounds that the decision-maker says they didn't get your letter, then my understanding of the case law is that you're likely to get fairly short shrift from the local authority. So my lords, conscious of the time, those are my submissions on breach. Can I then come finally to remedy? And the Secretary of State's position is that, if you're against me on everything that I've already said, then this is a case where it would be appropriate to exercise the powers in Section 3 rather than to make a Declaration of Incompatibility. And I don't think I actually need to take your Lordships and your Ladyship to the passage, guide and Volume 3 divider 14 paragraphs 30 to 33. You can read words in that change the meaning, but you can't adopt a meaning which is inconsistent with a fundamental part of the legislation. In my submission, reading section 204 to allow a right of appeal which extended to the consideration of facts. If that was what Article six required, would not be changing a fundamental part of the legislation. It would certainly be changing the meaning. And indeed, it would quite clearly be reversing what Parliament intended in 1996. But on my understanding of Gidan that is acceptable as long as it's fundamental to not fundamental to the legislation. Now, what I would say is that it would not on my learned friend, Mr. Goudie's submissions be at all easy to draft that new term of Section 3 as to precisely when this enhanced judicial review power would apply. But that doesn't mean you can't use Section 3. It merely shows the problems with my learned friend Mr's Goudie's arguments. Because if it was simply a question, every this has turned into a complete merits review under Section 204, and every issue could be considered"

p4,00:57:53.030,01:02:02.840,spk_2,"My Lords, My Lady. The fundamental point we submit on these appeals is that the law has moved on since Runa Begum. The Strasbourg decisions in Tsfayo and now Cromptom strike a rather, if not very different note. My learned friend Mr. Arden relied heavily yesterday afternoon on the speech by Lord Hoffmann in Runa Begum. If, however, one takes Lord Hoffman's approach in Runa Begum in its entirety and applies it to the facts in Tsfayo, then Mrs. Tsfayo loses. But of course, Mrs. Tsfayo, in fact, won. Mr. Arden emphasised in particular, paragraph 56 in Lord Hoffman's speech, and especially the statement that a limited review of the facts is sufficient in those areas of the law. such as regulatory and welfare schemes in which decision making is customarily entrusted to administrators. That approach, applied to housing benefit, would yield the answer that Mrs Tsfayo should have failed. What Lord Hoffman said in that respect is capable of applying every bit as much to housing benefit as to homelessness. But although in Runa Begum, homelessness lost. In Tsfayo, housing benefit won. So assuming Runa Begum, as well as Tsfayo, to be correctly decided, the distinction must be something other than the homelessness scheme on the one hand and the housing benefit scheme on the other hand. The distinction must be the distinction we suggest, made in Tsfayo itself, the distinction between expertise/ discretion issues such as suitability on the one hand and fact issues, on the other hand, such as in both Tsfayo and the present appeals. And indeed, we respectfully suggest that the approach should not be to ask oneself what is the least extent to which one has to chip away from Runa Begum, the approach should be to ask oneself, are the principles in Tsfayo applicable to the present case, or is the present case distinguishable from Tsfayo? If the music had stopped with Tsfayo, we submit that the answer is clearly that the present appeals of Tsfayo cases not Runa Begum cases. And if there were any doubt about that, it's entirely dispelled by the way in which Tsfayo has now been dealt with in Crompton. Lord Kingsley in the United Kingdom, the Gaming Board case, is a clear instance of the case on the other side of the line from Tsfayo and these appeals, that is, it is a case on the Runa Begum side of the line. Kingsley, of course, having been concerned with who is a fit and proper person and that, of course, being akin to what is or is not suitable accommodation. These, on the other hand, the present appeals are cases where, unlike in Runa Begum and Kingsley in cases of that sort, the factual issues are not incidental but are discrete. In Runa Begum, Lord Hoffmann at paragraph 51 52 and 56 described the decision as to suitability as the subject matter of the decision and as a classic exercise of administrative discretion. Here, the subject matter is entirely different. It is not suitability. And it is not something else, which is a classic exercise of administrative discretion."
p4,01:02:02.850,01:02:19.350,spk_0,"You're reading the words, subject matter, quite differently, aren't you, from the way Ms Lieven put it just a few moments ago? You're saying you look precisely at the very issue as to whether or not the letter was received. Is that right? Are you narrowing it down as much as that?"
p4,01:02:19.760,01:05:39.420,spk_2,"Well, it does come down to that in that in this instance, and I'm coming to this shortly, that if one takes the 3, one appreciates it's not an exhaustive list, if one takes the three criteria that is so to speak, highlighted in Bryan. In this case, the subject matter of the decision and the nature of the dispute come very close to one another, namely the issue of whether one expresses it as an issue of fact or an issue of credibility. But here the dispute is about a discreet factual issue. However, one characterises, however, one describes that issue, it is certainly not a dispute in whole or in part about suitability. And as the court has seen many times now Subsection 5 of Section 193 is in two parts. The authority ceases to be under the duty if first the condition is satisfied that the applicant has been informed of the consequences and if so, secondly, the offer that is refused is a suitable accommodation. And in our submission, the question whether the precondition is satisfied, what I earlier described as a gateway, is a discreet question. As Lord Browne has put it, there is a completely independent precondition, a separate parallel inquiry, not a staging post. So in terms of the three. Can I just be clear? I mean, is that now your case? I mean, are you narrowing it to the receipt of letters now that you've got? Now that Mrs Tomlinson is separately catered to? These are appeals are about the receipt of letters, and one is not therefore concerned specifically to argue the position in relation to intentionality, the issue in Tomlinson. But I accept, as I've always accepted, that are in terms of what are discreet issues of fact under Part seven, that is by no means necessarily confined to the question of receipt of letters. There may be other examples. Just as there are examples in addition to suitability of matters that are evaluative. What about how often the lifts work is that fact or is that evaluation? Well, that only comes in in the context of evaluation. There's nowhere in the legislation where there is a requirement in relation to lifts working or anything, any conclusion following from a factual finding that lifts don't work, whether or not lifts work simply goes into the consideration of the suitability of the accommodation and that, therefore, it's a classic example of a factual inquiry, which is incidental and ancillary to the determination of the suitability issue and is merely a staging post on the way to the determination of the suitable issue. So that is on the other side of the"
p4,01:05:39.420,01:05:39.920,spk_3,line
p4,01:05:41.560,01:08:59.190,spk_2,"and the Lord. So in terms of the three highlighted Bryan criteria, the subject matter of the decision is whether a letter in particular terms has been received, and that is very different from Runa Begum and is actually a fortiori to Tsfayo in terms of being a factual subject matter. The content of the dispute is whether the denial of receipt is credible. That again is very different from Runa Begum and again is afortiori to Tsfayo in terms of being a factual dispute. All that differs between Runa Begum and the present cases on the one hand, and Tsfayo on the other hand, is the manner in which the decision was made. The difference between an officer's decision and a panel of councillors' decision. That difference, however, in our submission is peripheral, both because comparing the two schemes, homelessness and housing benefit, it is not a material difference because homelessness reviews can be by councillors or by officers, and because in terms of independence and impartiality, there's not much difference between officers and councillors. Councillors, as my learned friend, Mr Arden acknowledged, are subject to codes of conduct which govern their conduct generally, not only their conduct in the one respect he highlighted for his purposes their conduct towards officers, but also and more importantly, their conduct towards the recipients of the council services. Like officers, councillors do not have a personal financial interest in the outcome. Like officers, they have an interest in their authorities, finances and resources, so one shouldn't over-denigrate councillors and their democratic accountability as a reason for not interfering with their decisions. Not, the contrary, as Alconbury and other cases demonstrate. And nor, on the other hand, should one over-praise officers. They are, of course, at one with counsillors in properly seeking to help the homeless. They are, of course, at one with counsillors in properly seeking not to prejudice unduly, more than necessarily, those who are on the authorities housing waiting lists. But officers may as readily as counsellors, get the balance wrong. From time to time, authorities not excluding Birmingham, are criticised for failure on the part of its officers to treat the homeless fairly. So officer decisions are neither inherently nor in practice, markedly superior as a class to councillor decisions as a class, this is not a distinction that one should make too much of. And in our submission, the manner of decision, therefore, is a minor difference between our case and Tsfayo. And given Crompton is not to be regarded as being a major feature of Tsfayo."
p4,01:09:08.470,01:09:09.500,spk_3,Yes.
p4,01:09:10.569,01:10:59.870,spk_2,"My Lords and my Lady, as regards whether the appellant undoubted rights are civil rights, it's now, of course, firmly established that rights are not prevented from being civil rights because they have a public nature. The law has, as Miss Lieven accepts, moved on since in Feldbrugge and the test is as stated in Salesi and Minnetto as regards social security and, uh, in our submission social welfare benefits, that is, is one talking about an individual economic right flowing from specific rules laid down in a statute. That is the test upon which we seek to rely. And Strasbourg has not carved out an exclusion for benefits in kind. On the contrary, it has extended property rights by accepting in a series of cases that a property right can be constituted by a legitimate expectation. And that is supported by the Italian POW case in an earlier passage than those to which the court's attention had been drawn so far, Paragraph 62 and 64 referring to Kopecky and as the court has seen by the Teteriny line of authorities to Teteriny itself at paragraphs 45 to 47. But here, the right is more crystallised and stronger than simply a legitimate expectation. If the criteria are satisfied, then the right exists, there is no discretion. There is a duty."

p4,01:11:00.870,01:13:50.430,spk_2,"fact that the duty may be discharged in different ways, provided always that it is discharged, that does not detract from the right and you do not need a judgement in your favour in order to have achieved the right. A right pursuant to statute is as much a civil right as a right pursuant to a judgement. If statutory rights exist, they do so whether or not a court has declared that they exist or if they've been denied, a mandatory order has been made with respect to them. A court order is not necessary in order for civil rights to crystallise and, were the position otherwise, it would be somewhat fortuitous and arbitrary. And the identification of a particular property is not an ingredient of the existence of the right. The right to have accommodation provided or secure, for one is itself a discreet right. It's not emasculated as such on account of separate questions that may arise in relation either to the performance of the duty or to the cessation of the duty and the Part 7, Section 193, Subsection 2 right indeed contrasts in that respect with the non-rights under Part 6 of the same act and the Part 7 Housing Act scheme, homelessness scheme is, moreover, similar to, rather than different from, cash benefits in having evaluative elements. Of course, if contrary to our submissions, one is looking at the scheme as a whole, then one can indeed point to evaluative elements in the homelessness scheme. But so, too, the housing benefit and other cash benefit schemes contain evaluative elements. By way of example only, housing benefit evaluation includes, considering whether there is a sham arrangement, whether there has been a deliberate deprivation of capital, and evaluation which compares rather with intentionality in the homeless scheme. And I think the one bundle the court hasn't looked at so far is Volume 2, which is devoted entirely to the housing benefit regulations, I think it's in fact, the current regulations that"

But circumstances which in effect will mean you will be denied benefit to which you would otherwise, for which you would otherwise have been eligible, uh, include in Subsection 1 of Section 9 that a person who is liable to make payments in respect of a dwelling should be treated as if he were not so liable where anyone of a dozen or so circumstances exist. Uh, including little A the tenancy or other agreement which, pursuant to which he occupies the dwelling, is not on a commercial basis, clearly an evaluative issue. That's the very first one.

p4,01:16:07.320,01:18:00.380,spk_2,"rather incestuous, my Lord. Yeah, but my Lord therefore, one sees that housing benefit involves a mixture of evaluative questions and mere arithmetical mechanics and so forth. And the same is the same is true of homelessness scheme that one has elements of both, and one can take that with other financial benefits as well. For example, in the case of disability living allowance, there's a mobility component which may be at a higher or a lower rate and or there's a care component which may be at a higher or a middle or a lower rate, all depending on evaluative judgments as to the severity of needs and so forth. So that is a feature that is not peculiar to homelessness, as compared with cash benefits of one kind or another, including but not confined to, housing benefit. In our submission Wound, Braun and Gwaza were are entirely different cases, and the admissibility decision instead we submit supports our case in at least two respects.

And again, that's significant for two purposes. One is because it is describing the general rule and secondly, because it is describing the general rule in terms not only of where at one time one may have started, namely social security, but also welfare benefits. So the law has developed. It may have started with only with contributory social security benefits, then extended to non-contributory benefits, but it's not confined to social security. It extends two in the language of Schuler, describing welfare assistance in the language of Tsfayo welfare benefits. And surely the homelessness scheme, beyond any doubt, is a scheme of welfare benefit or welfare assistance, and therefore, in terms of the applicability, Article 61 comes within what is expressed as being the general rule."
