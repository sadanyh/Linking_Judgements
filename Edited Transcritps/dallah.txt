Yes Ms Heilbron. Your Lordship, I appear for the appellant Dallah Real estate and Tourism Holding company with my learned friend Klaus Reichert. Mr Toby Landau and Mr Patrick Angenieux appear for the government of Pakistan. My Lords', as you will have seen from our case, this appeal raises issues which go to the very heart of the effectiveness of the New York Convention. The increasing use of international arbitration as an attractive alternative method of dispute resolution, compared to litigation, emanates in large measure from the success of the New York Convention 1958. It has been described as one of the most successful international conventions ever promulgated."

p1,00:01:55.730,00:01:55.790,spk_0,to -- well we apologise for so many bundles.

p1,00:02:12.420,00:03:54.116,spk_0,"was commenting on the facility with which awards can be enforced under the New York Convention is the key to such success trumping the often more difficult process of enforcement of judgments internationally and as Your Lordships' will have seen. This is the only the second reported case since England incorporated the New York Convention in the 1975 act, where an English court has refused to enforce a New York convention award under Article 51 of the Convention. The case has huge international implications as it signals whether the practice of the English courts in relation to enforcement matches its stated pro enforcement stance. The Court of Appeal decision and the decision below have attracted considerable interest and criticism from around the world. The English attitude to arbitration was until the 1996 act, somewhat out of line with other countries. That act was a major shift towards harmonisation of arbitral procedures and a less intrusive role for the courts, though it did not adopt the model law in every respect. Today we are considering only part of that act, namely those section's which incorporated the New York convention. I find myself in this appeal in a somewhat unusual position in that if I look ahead to Lord Saville in front of me, I see the author of the act And If I Look to My Left to Mr Landau, I see a drafter. So I hope that those gentlemen known far more about the ideology of the act than I do will bear with me as I proceed to analysed. I don't think you want to"
p1,00:03:54.116,00:03:58.436,spk_3,"make that assumption in my case, because for some years I've been engaged on something completely different."
p1,00:03:59.856,00:04:06.986,spk_0,"Indeed, My Lord. But in any event, I hope you will bear with me as I go through the relevant parts of the act."
p1,00:04:06.996,00:04:09.776,spk_2,"But in the end of the day, we take the language of the Act"

p1,00:04:20.782,00:04:48.380,spk_0,"Well the international writing about the case, there was one we put in in the case, the blog, but it's more commentary from feedback from people one talks to in the international world than specific article's they have.

p1,00:05:36.240,00:05:55.070,spk_0,"But I was only making the point at the outset. Not that I would necessarily adopt their criticisms in whole or part of something that I will, but simply to indicate the importance of the case, not just so many cases before Your Lordship has national implications, but this has a much wider implication."
p1,00:05:55.070,00:05:55.190,spk_2,And
p1,00:05:55.910,00:08:20.215,spk_0,"that was the only point I was making at the state. My Lord, as Your Lordship knows, but just for the benefit, perhaps, of those behind us. The case concerns enforcement of a unanimous ICC arbitration award rendered in Paris by an eminent international tribunal, providing Lord Michael Mustill, Dr Nassim Hasan Shah, former chief justice of Pakistan, and Dr Ghaleb Mahmassani, who's a Lebanese lawyer who was the chair. In 1995, Dallah, my clients proposed to the government of Pakistan the idea of providing housing in Mecca for pilgrims performing harsh. This in due course led to a memorandum of understanding on the 24th of July 1995 made between Dallah and the government and later on the 10th of September 1996 to the agreement the subject matter of this appeal. The agreement was on its face, stated to be made between Dallah and the trust, a state entity, the respondent. The government of Pakistan was not a signatory to the agreement, nor was it named as a party. Had it been, we would not be here today, the first issue before the tribunal and the focus of the English proceedings concerned whether or not the government was a party to the arbitration clause. In that agreement, the tribunal found on the law and on the facts that it was. It subsequently found the government to be a party to the underlying agreement and in Dallah's favour on liability and awarded it 18,000,900,7000 odd dollars in damages. Together with costs, the government did not waive jurisdiction before the arbitral tribunal and has asserted sovereign immunity. If, however, it is found to be a party to the arbitration agreement, it is deemed by virtue of Section 9 of the State Immunity at 1978 to have waived its immunity in relation to the arbitration proceedings that is different from enforcement against assets. Yes, Dallah obtained leave to enforce the award as a judgement of the English court. This was challenged by the government under Section 103(2)(b) of the 1996. This basis of the challenge being that it is not valid under the law to which the parties subjected it or failing any indication there on under the law of the country where the award was made and"
p1,00:08:20.215,00:08:21.495,spk_1,it's the latter part and
p1,00:08:21.495,00:08:24.125,spk_0,it's the latter because the agreement did not have any choice of
p1,00:08:24.125,00:08:24.435,spk_2,"law,"
p1,00:08:26.420,00:08:52.820,spk_0,"Mr Justice Aikens, as he then was, after a full rehearing, set aside the leave to enforce the award given by Mr Justice Clark coming to a different conclusion on the facts, applying French law to that of the tribunal and his decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. My Lord, with that very brief introduction, I would now like if I may to turn to the facts, My Lord, given that some 80% page's."
p1,00:08:53.135,00:08:57.895,spk_2,"We have quite a complete account of it in your written case, which we've all been able to read."
p1,00:08:57.955,00:09:47.585,spk_0,"What I would like to do, My Lord, with the greatest respect my learned friends had spent 80 page's, including appendices on the facts. Obviously, the underlying facts are of importance, and it's, for example, not easy for Your Lordships' to understand it. If, for example, you're not taking to the full agreement. So what I would like to do is to tell, take you as briefly as I can through the facts, because they are critical to the underlying submissions that we're going to make. One can't make the submissions in a vacuum without you actually having seen them and just reading them. Although you've seen the agreed statement of facts, you've seen the two slants, in my submission, it will be easier for you. Just see some of the documents conscious that, in one sense, a tedious process. But my submission, it's an essential process."
p1,00:09:47.595,00:09:50.845,spk_2,But if you could use your case as a template as it were. I will. And
p1,00:09:50.855,00:10:05.885,spk_0,"I'm basically in my submissions, if it is of any assistance, will be going through it in the order of my case, though not verbatim to the case, obviously, because I will be taking account of points made against me in my Mr Landau's."
p1,00:10:05.895,00:10:30.890,spk_1,"Yes, what is the basic message or theme which you're going to ask us to be, considering when we're looking at the facts? Is it that the courts below just dead wrong to disagree with the arbitrator, arbitrators or what? Is that the purpose of the review of the facts or what is the purpose?"
p1,00:10:30.900,00:10:48.920,spk_0,"Well, I think several purposes. First of all, the both the tribunal and the court considered the test of common intention. I'll come in a moment to the difference between transnational law and French law, which is an issue I have to deal"
p1,00:10:48.920,00:10:49.310,spk_2,with.
p1,00:10:49.640,00:11:59.940,spk_0,"But when you are looking at the common intention, one has to take away one's natural instinct is an English lawyer, and one looks at the test of the intention of the parties from the beginning to the end, looking at their behaviour objectively to determine the subjective intention and the purpose of taking you through it is to indicate well, first, the tribunal got it right. But if I am wrong in that to show that there were two that it was not this was a case where it was possible to give different interpretations, but primarily that when you were looking at the award, as we will do, and I will be asking to place emphasis on that, that, inherently, the tribunal got it right. And therefore, when you're looking at reviewing an award when you have a fully reasoned award, which on its face stands up, considerable weight ought to be given to that. And the English court should not be trying to reinterpret documents where there's no new, actual, no new evidence."
p1,00:11:59.950,00:12:08.450,spk_2,"Can I take it that you'll be going and answering the various points that Mr Landau house as to why, he says the tribunal got it wrong. He's got the list, and you deal with that."
p1,00:12:08.460,00:14:05.850,spk_0,"I will do my best. So, My Lord, before I do that though, I would just like to reiterate briefly the French test, which I said in a sentence a moment ago. For your note, the summary of French law is set out in paragraph 49 of our case at page's 20, starts at paragraph 49, page's 22 to 25 a more detailed exposition is that paragraph's 85 to 96 of Mr Justice Aikens judgement. But if I can just paraphrase it and I hope there is a little between us on this, essentially in order to determine whether an arbitration clause upon which the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal is founded extends to a personal party who is neither a named party nor a signatory to the underlying agreement containing that clause, it's necessary to ascertain whether all the parties to the arbitration proceedings had the common intention, whether express or implied, to be bound by the agreement and hence the arbitration agreement. Or, to put it another way, that the non signatory was aware of the arbitration clause and accepted its terms. Under French law, this common intention is determined in the light of the facts of the case, starting at the beginning of the chronology and going on to the end looking at the facts in the round, including considering the involvement and behaviour of all the parties during the negotiation, performance and, if applicable, termination of the underlying agreement, and the court seeks to ascertain the subjective intentions of the parties through their objective conduct. In other words, if you behave as a party, that is objective, an objective piece of conduct that can be deemed to indicate that you intended to be a party."
p1,00:14:05.910,00:14:07.590,spk_3,If both parties have to
p1,00:14:08.680,00:14:09.310,spk_0,"yes,"
p1,00:14:09.330,00:14:10.580,spk_3,satisify the intention.
p1,00:14:10.590,00:14:11.540,spk_0,"Indeed, indeed."
p1,00:14:11.540,00:14:14.760,spk_2,Is it suggested transnational law leads to any different conclusion?
p1,00:14:15.620,00:14:27.120,spk_0,We say no. But points are taken on it by my learned friend as to whether or not it makes a difference. And I'm going to come to that and explain in our submission it doesn't.
p1,00:14:27.590,00:14:29.870,spk_1,What date are you looking at? Intention?
p1,00:14:30.960,00:14:37.800,spk_0,"Well, you're looking at intention under French law the whole period, you're not looking at it at a particular date."
p1,00:14:37.810,00:14:43.060,spk_1,Does that mean you've got to have the intention throughout the whole period of the contract?
p1,00:14:43.070,00:14:43.890,spk_0,No.
p1,00:14:43.900,00:14:45.230,spk_1,"What if,"
p1,00:14:45.900,00:14:46.510,spk_0,what
p1,00:14:46.510,00:15:10.800,spk_1,"if you came to the conclusion that there was never any intention to be party to the contract throughout its course, but, subsequent date a party had indicated or said something, which, on the face of it, the belief that they were a party of the agreement."
p1,00:15:10.810,00:15:16.430,spk_0,That is highly relevant under French law and that would be sufficient in our submission. But without
p1,00:15:16.430,00:15:24.240,spk_1,"any although the contracts past, there's no reliance on that. No detriment, no consideration, no cause."
p1,00:15:24.380,00:15:50.450,spk_0,"You have to look at it in our submission one of two ways. You can either look at it as to the involvement of the government throughout. But if you were nonetheless to take the view that the government had not expressed an intention early on, but later expressed an intention, for example, in the process of the termination, to become a party that in our submission under French law is sufficient."
p1,00:15:50.990,00:15:59.340,spk_1,"Without any sort of reliance or cause, or quid pro quo, where one thing"
p1,00:15:59.370,00:16:41.390,spk_0,"it's a question of what the parties, if by the government's behaviour it indicated that it intended to become a party to that agreement that under French law, in our submission, is sufficient. There was some cross examination of the hearing because our our expert witness indicated that there was perhaps something slightly different format of French law called adhesion. But under cross examination he accepted that the test throughout was the question of common intention and the only difference would be as to when that party intended to become a party,"
p1,00:16:41.470,00:16:43.890,spk_3,"both parties have to intend it at the same moment, do they?"
p1,00:16:45.130,00:16:49.160,spk_0,I'm not sure both parties necessarily have to intend it at the same moment.
p1,00:16:49.170,00:17:01.240,spk_3,"If A intend it up to up to date A and then no longer intends it and B intends it between date A and B, but A never intend it between date A, there would be not good there, will it?"
p1,00:17:01.300,00:17:13.620,spk_0,"I think, in that situation. But in our submission, our clients intended it throughout. We were pointed to the evidence, and it is our submission that the government was involved throughout. But even if we're wrong,"
p1,00:17:13.620,00:17:15.030,spk_3,involves not the same thing is it?
p1,00:17:15.290,00:18:05.150,spk_0,"The government were involved and intended to be a party throughout. But even if we're wrong on that and and you will see both the tribunal and the courts or Mr Justice Aikens, the most critical thing, as I'm sure you've read in the case, was what happened at and around the end of the performance period because this contract was only in existence for three months. And therefore how it ended, who ended it, and uh, who intended to be a part of that point is quite critical. So but just to emphasise it is sufficient for my purposes, for the tribunal to find that it was at the end, only that the"
p1,00:18:05.450,00:18:06.320,spk_1,government
p1,00:18:06.330,00:18:35.250,spk_0,"became a party and what you will see when we go through it when we go through the award, and the judgement is that to an extent, both the court and the tribunal were of the view that although there were factors early on, it was what happened around the time of the refusal to re-promulgate the ordinance, which effectively meant that the trust the judge went up in smoke happened, which was critical to both decisions."
p1,00:18:35.260,00:18:51.110,spk_2,"The judge made it clear, I think, in paragraph 105, for example, that he was going through the chronology from beginning to end. Yes, that's what he said. That's the task, he said himself. You saying he didn't actually carry it through to the end?"
p1,00:18:51.480,00:20:03.480,spk_0,"I don't think there's any dispute that the judge applied. The judge applied the right test in the sense that he used the right test was his application of the facts to the fret using the French test, which is the difference between the way the tribunal did it and the way he did it. I'm not criticising his formulation of the French law. But what I am saying is that applying French law, the test of common intention, which, as Lord Colin says, is the same and transnational law, the test of common intention, both in effect, applied the same test. But when looking at the facts of the case, the judge took a different view largely on one letter from the tribunal. And what we say is in those circumstances where there's no new evidence, one has to look very carefully as to whether an English court is right in coming in and completely effectively ignoring. Although obviously read the tribunal's decision coming to a different conclusion on the facts of that case"
p1,00:20:03.490,00:20:14.050,spk_3,"on this part of the case, it's just a question of fact. It's got nothing to do with the future international arbitration at all. It's just a question of how you apply the agreed principles of French law to the facts, isn't it? Well,"
p1,00:20:14.050,00:20:15.330,spk_0,it has more with respect.
p1,00:20:15.800,00:20:20.060,spk_3,"We're just regurgitating the same old cases the third time around, at least, must be the fourth time round if we count the tribunal."
p1,00:20:21.100,00:20:56.750,spk_0,"I have to do it for two reasons. One, my learned friend has spent so much time only in fairness to my clients, I must, with respect, deal with it. But secondly, it is relevant because it's relevant when you are considering, when we get to the first main issue, which is the extent of the view. One of the considerations that the court will have to have is what what is the weight should be given to the award, and you can only understand the weight to be given to that award when you see the award having seen the facts on which"
p1,00:20:56.840,00:20:59.210,spk_3,I suppose the answer is the appropriate weight depending upon the circumstances.

p1,00:21:01.950,00:21:54.330,spk_1,"I just put one point because it goes to your the point we've just been discussing about when the intention is relevant. It seemed to me reading the award and that it was actually decided on the basis that the inquiry was as to the intention throughout. The award says such behaviour shows and proves the defendant has always been and considered itself a true party to the agreement and it said the defendant has been in actual fact the party that was involved in the negotiation, implementation and termination of the agreement with the claimant. From the first day that the housing project was contemplated until after the repudiation of such agreement. This was and remains true before, during and after the existence of the trust.

And it's been involved in the formation of holy places in Saudi Arabia for over 80 years, providing services for pilgrims visiting Mecca and is the largest provider of such services in Saudi Arabia. An important piece of background information is that in the context of what happened here is that Dallah has for a number of years been one of the largest lenders doing business with the government of Pakistan. It's been an active provider of Islamic finance to the government for to the tune of some $365 million in the five years before the agreement, and it's therefore established a relationship with members of the government and the proposal was put forward.

Here you have a government who has been doing business with my clients for many years, successfully, of which there's been no problems. My clients are entitled to rely upon them, and what happened here is after three months, they failed to re-promulgate the ordinance so that the contract disappears.

p1,00:26:02.080,00:26:17.920,spk_1,"just help me? Was there any, of a matter of interest, any evidence about what would have been the position after the trust disappeared. If it had any assets, would have there been any way of enforcing a claim against the trust in that situation?"
p1,00:26:18.890,00:26:19.630,spk_0,Or against the assets?
p1,00:26:19.630,00:26:20.370,spk_1,Was there any evidence?
p1,00:26:22.890,00:27:24.410,spk_0,"There wasn't really any evidence. I think what would have happened with the assets is the assets were going to be held through one of my clients, Associated companies as the trustee bank. But there weren't any assets, of course, because it was two years hence. But from recollection, I'll be corrected if I'm wrong. I think there may have been a little bit of discussion, I think. I think if I recall, looking at the transcript over the weekend, there was some discussion about what would have happened. But in practice, nothing did happen. And it really, in a sense, is academic because it had a three, three month life. One might be able to argue Lord Mance's point if the promulgation had been much later. But in practice, it was inevitable that there would be no money because the source of the money was to come from the pilgrims and the pilgrims weren't going to be able to provide any money until there was some housing."
p1,00:27:24.420,00:27:43.470,spk_1,"Your problem really is not trust cease to exist. The problem is that didn't have any assets, even if it continued to exist and be re promulgated and simply said to you, Go away. We're not having any further part of this project. You would have been left with a claim against a shell without any assets."
p1,00:27:44.270,00:27:47.480,spk_0,"Well, not with respect if I'm right."
p1,00:27:47.490,00:28:02.520,spk_1,"Not, of course, if you're right that the governor Pakistan is behind. But you complained about the government of Pakistan's failure to re promulgate the trust. That seems to me not the real problem, necessarily."
p1,00:28:02.740,00:29:49.520,spk_0,"Well, except if they have not taken away our contractual partner. In other words, it was the government who prevented the contract continuing. They had not done so. Then we would have been able to continue with the contract, and thereby would have. Presumably they would have then been some assets against which to enforce it at a later date, there was a breach. But the point I was really making here was that this was although it was a commercial, there was also an undercurrent to assist the pilgrims. And if you've got Mr Naqvi statement, you will see that he deals with the plight of the Pakistan pilgrims in paragraph 6 and 7, and in summary, he comments that they tend to be poorer and odour have to wait until late in life and suffer great financial hardship, making the pilgrimage often being exploited by unruly Saudi landlords and packed into over priced accommodations. And the last sentence, he explains a lot in paragraph 7. As a result seemed to me there was potential for a scheme to be introduced in order to provide some form of assistance to the pilgrims from Pakistan. And if you go then to the first document that I will just take you to the very beginning of history, which is the letter of the 15th February 1995 which is page 1."

p1,00:29:54.050,00:33:52.600,spk_0,"Of bundle C. It's used for just to see this because this is the start of the story and it's written to His Excellency Ministry for Hajj. We're taking the opportunity to write, too, about a very special situation has arisen in Saudi Arabia, which will prove to be an enormous benefit for the government and the people of Pakistan. He then goes on to say the king of Saudi Arabia and the custodian of the holy places has given the task of maintenance to the Dallah Albaraka group and due to this, we've been closely involved in the development and expansion of the holy cities. As part of this development, new regulations coming into effect, the group has been allowed to offer to selected Muslim governments housing complexes in Mecca and Medina for 55 year leases. As you maybe aware, the government of Pakistan rents housing in Mecca each year for the Hajj, and every year there's a problem. The acquisition of these sites will eliminate this problem for a period of 55 years would also result in considerable cost savings for the government of Pakistan and therefore they make the proposal. And in the end, last paragraph in closing, we'd like to add It's a unique opportunity for Pakistan and we hope we'll be able to assist more Pakistan Muslims in performing their religious obligations and earn the blessing of God Almighty. And then they asked to make a detailed presentation. So that's how it starts and we without taking you through all the documents. It's quite clear both from the documentary evidence and from the statement of Mr Naqvi that senior members of the government and ministers. As I said from the prime minister downwards, the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance were all involved throughout the whole project and the government's approval was required at every step of the way and in relation to every aspect of the deal. Its approval was required in relation to the least and the financial plan. The Pakistani ambassador viewed the potential for sites in Mecca and the government had input into the site chosen. The detailed specifications and drawings were approved by the government and even after the agreement to which the government was not a signatory, had been signed, Mr Naqvi explains that all his dealings were with members of the government. Now the structure of the deal, as evidence of by the agreement arose because it was a means whereby the government could finance the project consistently with Islamic principles. And the ultimate structure was an Islamic finance lease because, as you know, under Islamic principles, you can't claimed interest. And it enabled also the government to obtain dollars outside Pakistan at a time when its currency had devalued by approximately 15% and there were foreign exchange issues, so that's what underlined it. And the essence of the deal in our submission didn't change. It was simply the manner in which it was to be fine. Mr. Naqvi explains that there were two options. Either the government could divert its own borrowed funds, or Dallah could raise funds by way of a facility backed by a government guarantee. And you see, that real note is paragraph 46 of Mr Nafis witness statements. So we now come to the first agreement, which is the memorandum of understanding, and that is dated. Perhaps I just before I do that. Let me just take you to, Page 19 as an example of what I was saying, which is a letter of the 15th of July 1995 financing proposal how harsh housing."

Page 28 which indicates that the Cabinet had approved in principle in December the proposal for the establishment of the trust. I think that's all you need to know about that at this stage, and it will over the page. The intention is to establish a separate fund known as the savings and investment fund. We then go to the memorandum of agreement, which is referred to, but I think it's easier to read it in full and that's a page 30 and this is dated the 25th, fourth, of July 1995. It's made between the president, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Dallah, and Clause 1 requires Dallah to acquire within the holy City lands necessary for the development and construction of the housing facilities sought by the government. For Pakistan pilgrims while performing hajj and umrah is more specifically described in the schedule, its Clause 2 sets out, the cost of the land and the housing facilities to be constructed there on. Clause 3, upon the completion of the housing facilities, Dallah shall demise and lease them to the government along with the land. And the government should take the said facilities and land on such lease for a term of 99 years, subject to Dallah arranging the necessary financing for the government on terms approved by the government in accordance with the provisions of this agreement and then four within 30 days of the execution here of Dallah shall prepare and submit to the government for its approval the terms and conditions of the proposed lease and the detailed plan for financing of the same. Approval and acceptance of the lease and the financing plan by the government will be communicated in writing to Dallah. The date of receipt of such approval by Dallah will be the approval date, where such approval and acceptance is not conveyed by the government. Within 90 days of so admission of terms and conditions of the proposed lease and detailed financing plan by Dallah, the government or the government conveys its disapproval or non acceptance of such terms and conditions and finance sink plan.

p1,00:41:20.480,00:41:24.370,spk_0,"gazetted on I think from memory, the 14th of February 1996."
p1,00:41:25.340,00:41:28.520,spk_2,I thought the ordinance was promulgated on the 31st of January.
p1,00:41:28.520,00:41:29.710,spk_0,31st January. We're coming to that shortly.
p1,00:41:30.890,00:41:35.750,spk_2,Yes. You're quite right that the Court of Appeal say it came into existence on the 14th of February.
p1,00:41:37.860,00:46:08.460,spk_0,"And so we really now come. Actually, I think that is the next document I need to take you to. We can skip all the leases, et cetera, and the next well, the next relevant document. Perhaps just passing through is, page 86 because in September, an associate company of the appellant purchased the land and in November transferred it to Dallah. That becomes relevant later. But the next document is the ordinance, which is page 93 and that's dated the 31st of January. And the recycle, if I may just spend a few moments on this, whereas it is expedient to provide for the establishment of a trust to mobilise savings from the pilgrims, desirous of performing Hajj and investment thereof in the Islamic modes of investment and for facilitating harsh operations and matters connected there with an incidental there too. And whereas the National Assembly is not in session, the President satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate action. So you will see the two purposes are one Islamic modes of investment and secondly, facilitating Hajj. And then over the page, you will see the definitions. And if I can just draw your attention in particular to Little E, managing trustee means the secretary, religious affairs division, government of Pakistan or such other person of integrity have a good record, et cetera, as the federal government may appoint to perform the functions of the managing trustee Trustee Bank means a bank or financial institution appointed by the board to collect deposits from members, maintain their accounts in the fund and make investment thereof in accordance with the direction of the board. And three is important because it appears in the agreement establishment of the trust as soon as may be, after the commencement of this ordinance, the federal government shell by notification in the Official Gazette, established a trust known as the Awami Hajj Trust. It will be a body corporate, having perpetual succession and a common seal with part to acquire, hold and dispose of property and made by its name, sue and be sued. The headquarters of the trash will be at Islamabad, and it may establish its regional offices in such other places as the federal government may be determined, and then you see the purposes and objects of the trust is to mobilise the savings and to invest the savings, defray the expenses and adopt measures for facilitating the performance of Hajj. And then you see the board of trustees. Not all but the majority are members of the government. The chairman of the Pakistan Banking Counsel, for example, is not. There are a considerable number. And then at 52, which is important, the secretary, Religious Affairs division government of Pakistan shall act as secretary of the board that becomes relevant later. So he wears two hats Once the trust comes into existence and then you have the powers and the functions and the powers and functions of the managing trustee. I'm not sure much turns on that page 97 10. The fund fund of the Trust, to be known as the Savings and Investment Trust and should be maintained by the Trustee Bank and it should be financed by the following sources. Contributions and savings by the members, contributions by philanthropists for the welfare of harsh profits, earning and capital gains from the investments made out of savings of members and income from movable and immovable properties of the trust and then 11 reports. The managing trustee shall by the end of each financial year is when the factual government may direct submit annual audited report of the fund to the board and such other reports about its activities as the board or the federal government may direct. And then the board may, with the prior approval of the federal government, make rules for carrying out the purpose of this ordinance."

To his somewhat consternation, I think that clearly accepted that it has to be re-promulgated and if it's not re-promulgated, it lapses unless it can be re promulgated retrospectively. But it wasn't in this case. What happened quite clearly in our submission is there was a change of government. The change of government on the 6th of November, the next time it was due to be re promulgated was six weeks later. And the change of government because, as you will see as we're going on in the history, they were being pressed to sort out or assist with the sorting out of the financing and the financing of the project was dependent of the trigger of the government providing a guarantee. The government, for whatever reason, clearly decided this was a project that didn't want to pursue and therefore it didn't re-promulgate this. There's no evidence at all as to why it didn't re-promulgated. It was said that it may have been a mistake on the part of the minister, but there's no evidence of that."

But in the end, in the light of the findings, there was Pakistan. Witnesses were called. But in the end, the issue the government, the lawyer called by the Pakistan government made it quite clear. And I can find in the German the evidence that once there is ceases to be promulgation, that is the end of it and it goes up and the judge are several times it goes up in a puff of smoke."

Dallah purchased the land and acquired it on the 18th of November, i.e after the expiry. According to Clause 3, Dallah sent the drawings and specifications which were only do after the approval date, and these were approved and they were also approved according to the evidence of Mr Naqvi on the 30th of July. So when one looks also at some of the correspondence, it's quite clear that the parties were still negotiating. And so whether it in practice lapsed as or whether or not the parties continue to work on under, it may, in a sense, be academic. The fact is, for the next few months, the parties were negotiating the financial structure and the financial deal, and the agreement therefore implemented the MOU consistently with the framework.

This is after the trust has come into existence, and it says further to our various discussions, I'm pleased to set forth below the implementation schedule covering the provision of pilgrims housing in Mecca. And there, then there are proposals set forward, and if you go over the page payment plans, we are proposing two options by which the government could take these buildings from us and the first stop, the following agreed assumptions have been utilised in order to develop the payment plan and a number of the first plan. Number three a down payment of $100 million from the government of Pakistan has been assumed Dallah will arrange for the lane. So in the first option, the government itself is putting forward the money against alone. Then there's a plan A advanced rent plan B partial formulae, 12,000 pilgrims will be free for the government of Pakistan and the government of Pakistan will pay us 395 per pilgrim and then legal issues. In order to comply with the legal requirements of the various entities involved. The structure will be as follows the government to set up the trust Trust will borrow from Albaraka Trust will make the down payment trust will enter into the lease in order to provide the government maximum flexibility. We would propose that the government retained the following two options. The government has the right for a period of five years to develop housing on the remaining land, and the government has a right to buy the least outright during the 1st 10 years at a price of 345 million, minus the event already paid.

p1,01:05:36.320,01:05:37.740,spk_3,picture. I quite understand.
p1,01:05:37.750,01:07:34.720,spk_0,"My Lord, I would obviously say that it wasn't important. I said that is the reason we are here because otherwise there would be no issue. The introduction is made the 10th of September, and it refers to the trust established as you would have seen earlier under Section 3 of the ordinance with its registered office, is that Islamabad and Dallah my clients and the introduction says the trust is interesting in leasing reliable housing facilities and whereas Dallah owns adequate, appropriate real estate and the Clause 1 is the obligation of Dallah to develop and construct the necessary accommodation. Clause 2 is important. The total least value of the land area of 22,000 square metres and the total construction cost of the housing it is computed at respectively. 210 million, 135 million aggregating $345 million out of which the trust shall pay a lump sum of $100 million to Dallah by way of advanced lease payment within 30 days from the date of the execution of this agreement by the parties subject to Dallah arranging through one of its affiliates a U. S dollar 100 million financing facility for the Trust against a guarantee of the Government of Pakistan Dallah submitting it to the trust performance put Bond and then a counter guarantee issued by the Trust and Al Baraka Investment appointed by the Board of Trustees in favour of the government of Pakistan. So, in order for this to get on the off the ground, the trust has no money. It borrows the money from Dallah but before Dallah is prepared to lend the money it has to have a guarantee from the government."
p1,01:07:35.450,01:07:41.090,spk_2,I think a quick glance through this is the only reference to the government of Pakistan in this document.
p1,01:07:41.100,01:07:41.790,spk_0,I think that's right
p1,01:07:42.460,01:07:43.290,spk_2,as a guarantor.
p1,01:07:46.210,01:07:47.970,spk_3,And that's consistent with the letter. We just looked
p1,01:07:47.970,01:07:48.200,spk_0,at
p1,01:07:49.510,01:07:51.120,spk_3,the letter we were looking at a moment ago.
p1,01:07:51.360,01:07:52.020,spk_0,"Yes,"
p1,01:07:53.300,01:07:59.550,spk_3,"contemplated that very thing. Namely, the role of the government would be as guarantor."
p1,01:08:00.400,01:08:46.690,spk_0,"Yes, but what one also has to look at with respect, My Lord, is the basis upon which this evolved as a financing structure underlying the project. The underlying project was a government project. But we'll see that more in a moment just to take you through this. The government will come into effect on the date Dallah received from the trust advanced lease payment and submits the performance bond. Dallah shall develop, construct and complete the housing in accordance with such detailed specifications and drawings that shall be approved by the trust within 30 days from the date of execution of this agreement appears to be no obligation to resubmit the specifications. But just a provision for the trust to approve them."
p1,01:08:46.700,01:09:07.420,spk_1,"Can understand the guarantee which we were looking at a moment ago, is going to be given by the government of Pakistan and not to Dallah, but to whoever is supplying $100 million. The bank presumably supplying $100 million to Dallah no words is a guarantee in favour of a third party."
p1,01:09:09.490,01:09:13.450,spk_0,"Well, yes, indeed. Dallah will arrange."
p1,01:09:13.470,01:09:29.359,spk_1,"Dallah is going to find someone who will lend the money. But I don't know why, Dallah is supposed to be very big, but nonetheless a guarantee of the governor. Pakistan is going to enable dollar to borrow more easily or arrange."
p1,01:09:29.890,01:09:51.529,spk_0,"Also, one has to remember that the loan is being lent to an empty shell. The trust has no money so that there must be some way to recover that money if the trust, for example, if the trust doesn't earn any money from its buildings at the moment the trust has gotten"
p1,01:09:51.930,01:10:07.640,spk_1,"so it is that it is a guarantee to Dallah, then is it, Dallah arranging through one of its affiliates a dollar financing facility for the trust? Yes, I see. Yes."
p1,01:10:08.360,01:10:09.500,spk_3,Is there a draft?
p1,01:10:10.460,01:10:11.690,spk_0,"Yes, there is."
p1,01:10:11.700,01:10:32.020,spk_1,"Yes, I'm wrong. This is something which Dallah is going to arrange for the trust the trust is going to borrow from a third party or from from one of Dallah's Affiliates. Actually, that's right. And the government is going to guarantee. What about the second reference to the governemnt of Pakistan at the end of clause to this counter-guarantee."
p1,01:10:32.020,01:10:34.340,spk_0,That really didn't come into play.
p1,01:10:34.350,01:10:35.540,spk_1,How does it work?
p1,01:10:35.550,01:10:37.990,spk_0,"Well, the counter guarantee"
p1,01:10:39.440,01:10:44.110,spk_1,"issued by the Trust and Albaraka Islamic Bank, appointed by the poor trustees"
p1,01:10:44.830,01:10:45.040,spk_0,in
p1,01:10:45.040,01:10:46.940,spk_1,favour of the government of Pakistan.
p1,01:10:46.960,01:10:58.910,spk_0,"This would be, as I understand it, that if we got that far, what happened of course here is the money wasn't raised, is that there would be."
p1,01:10:58.920,01:10:59.750,spk_1,"Yes, I see a"
p1,01:10:59.750,01:11:21.580,spk_0,"counter guarantee back to the government, the government. The government was the trigger because you couldn't raise the finance until the government had produced the guarantee You couldn't get the advanced payment because the trust didn't have any money until there were facilities available to the trust. So the starting point of anything had to be the guarantee."
p1,01:11:22.430,01:11:26.730,spk_2,"Yes, it's another indication of the separateness of the trust."
p1,01:11:28.260,01:12:23.560,spk_0,"Well, My Lord, I'm not denying that on the face of this agreement, I couldn't deny on the face of this agreement that the trust is the party. But what I we have argued, what the tribunal concluded was that you have to look at who was was the government a party to this agreement either is the only party as an extra party, and one is looking therefore outside the wording of the agreement in order to determine that. My Lord, I accept apart from the guarantee, there is no reference to the government, but one has to look at it under French law, not as one would look at it. Perhaps under English law does construe it. But one looks at it not only what happened before, but what happened afterwards, something which perhaps is difficult for us to understand that that's how it's done under French law."
p1,01:12:23.560,01:12:39.120,spk_3,"But applying French law if you look at it at the moment the parties signed this agreement, it's very difficult to say. See how one could hope that the government was intended to be a party. Every indication is that there wasn't intended to be a party. It was intended only to be a guarantor,"
p1,01:12:39.240,01:12:40.190,spk_0,but for --
p1,01:12:40.190,01:12:44.090,spk_3,"both parties, whether you're looking at under French or anybody else's law."
p1,01:12:44.130,01:12:46.960,spk_0,"Fortunately, French law doesn't stop there."
p1,01:12:47.250,01:12:51.920,spk_3,"That may be so, but I'm just focusing on where we've got to. So far, you've got a history"
p1,01:12:51.920,01:12:53.610,spk_2,very end. You say you've
p1,01:12:53.620,01:12:54.570,spk_0,got to go to the end
p1,01:12:55.090,01:13:27.090,spk_2,"just just just in passing. When we were looking at the ordinance, it's worth just bearing in mind that Clause 10 provided for a fund of the trust to be set up, and the sources of the funding announced were not government sources. I think I'm right in saying their contributions from philanthropists and so on games for investments and income from the properties of the trust. So the idea was a self financing trust supported by outside interests and so on."
p1,01:13:27.240,01:13:28.670,spk_0,"Yes, that's"
p1,01:13:28.680,01:13:31.040,spk_2,"the idea. It would stand on its own feet, really"
p1,01:13:31.990,01:15:08.340,spk_0,"the structure. Because, as I showed you earlier on, there were various structures that were considered. It was part of the Islamic financing, and that was the structure with the government had agreed as the means of achieving the objective of providing housing for the pilgrims. My Lord, as I said, I accept entirely that, and I must deal with it, even though it is perhaps not in my favour, right, that I should take you through this. So I was just at four. That Dallah will develop construct, complete the housing in accordance with the detailed specifications. Just one point to note because it becomes relevant later, is that there is no obligation, as I said, to send the specifications at this stage simply that they need to be approved by the trust. 5(a), the trust irrevocably and unconditionally agreed to take on the lease return of 99 years. Then 5(c) agreed between the parties upon the execution of the lease agreement. The advanced lease payments would be a portion as payment for the entire period of the lease. In respect of such portion, the leased premises provides accommodation 12,000 pilgrims. And then there's a provision which perhaps I can just summarise whereby you can pay less by paying earlier rather than wait for the whole of the 99 year period to elapse. And then other clause's I need to take you to I can jump. I think the rest is just dealing with the"

p1,01:18:28.540,01:18:37.400,spk_3,"I'm asking whether on your case, they waived. The government waived any state immunity it might have under Clause 25."

p1,01:18:52.860,01:18:58.710,spk_3,"matter, but I just like to know on your analysis, whether that is a waiver by the government."
p1,01:18:58.980,01:19:36.220,spk_0,"Well, My Lord, I think on my analysis, I would have to say that the government didn't specifically in terms, so I couldn't argue that the consequence would be if they were a party would depend on how one interpreted the contract visa the government. And if the conclusion is that they were a party throughout, even though they hadn't specifically said so, if they were a party by virtue of being a party to the arbitration clause, that would be sufficient for my purposes."
p1,01:19:36.810,01:19:59.210,spk_2,"That isn't right is it? Your original case before the tribunal Dallah's original case was alter ego or successor? Yes. Those circumstances, they would simply be the same as the trust, yes, but if they're simply an additional party in some sense, then the immunity provisions wouldn't necessarily apply."
p1,01:19:59.220,01:20:26.630,spk_0,"That with respect was what I was trying to say. But the immunity provision itself as stated set out. But that wouldn't necessarily matter. Because if I'm right under French law that they are a party, then if they are a party to the arbitration agreement, in any event, the immunity goes vis a vis the by virtue of Section 9 of the state immunity."
p1,01:20:27.690,01:20:34.760,spk_1,"There is actually different because the immunity clause is wider, isn't it? A waiver of execution and attachment."
p1,01:20:36.850,01:20:53.510,spk_2,Clause 27 does seem to envisage the government as a separate party. The whole idea of assigning and transferring rights and obligations is that they were separate. What would happen to Clause 26 carry with it if rights and obligations were transferred under the agreement?
p1,01:20:55.620,01:21:15.310,spk_0,"Well My Lord, I think it's right again. Specifically, one couldn't impose obligations which specifically relate to the trust in relation to sovereignty or"

So to the extent this is background, but because the agreement in itself does not specifically make them a party. But you have to look at the whole picture and looking at the whole picture together with the fact that at the end they step back in for the purposes of French law, My Lord, one is therefore allowed to look at it in the round or, alternatively, one can look at it at a later moment and say, well, okay, it was the government"

The borrower ceases to be under the control of the government of Pakistan. Pakistan seems to be a member of good standing International Monetary Fund. That's really the only point that I make from that. But that was sent and therefore, to put that in context, it's page 314. You'll see that she's the net is waiting for clearance of the documents from the government. We're now in the 21st of November. As you're aware, we signed the agreement on the 10th of September and you were required to conclude the financing within 30 days. However, as a result of your clear market mandate to ANZ grindlays, we were forced to delay and only released our documents on the 22nd of October 1996 the date the Z mandate expired. That was an issue on the liability which perhaps in part for the moment, I'm sure you realise it's becoming more and more difficult to keep the syndicate together and we would therefore request you to expedite the latter. So you will see that there is being chased not only the minister of religious affairs, but also the Minister of Finance to get on and sort out the documentation. And this may be the background to why something the government felt something had to be done to resolve the position on midnight. As you know, on the 11th 12th December, the trust disappeared."

p1,01:30:51.920,01:31:15.870,spk_0,No other than the agreement itself. So it was an empty share really survived for three months after the agreement was signed. Now one has to look at the consequence and the effect of the failure to re-promulgate the ordinance. It's
p1,01:31:15.870,01:31:24.220,spk_1,"as matter of interest. I mean, don't spend any time on it. But the 19 million loss related to what?"

p1,01:31:42.010,01:31:45.460,spk_1,there's never been any proceedings or attempted proceedings on the MOU.
p1,01:31:46.340,01:31:51.820,spk_0,"No. And in any event, the MOU also had an arbitration clause."
p1,01:31:52.930,01:31:53.650,spk_1,"Saudi Arabia,"
p1,01:31:54.120,01:31:59.720,spk_0,Saudi Arabia. So
p1,01:31:59.730,01:32:02.750,spk_3,would there be any reason why these claims shouldn't have been made under the MoU.

But it certainly refined the MoU. I think with respect it might be difficult for us to brought in any event. Proceedings were brought on the assumption that the government were a party to the subsequent agreement. It would have been difficult to bring proceeding or arbitration proceedings under the MOU. Was"
p1,01:32:47.510,01:32:50.340,spk_2,there enough in the MOU actually to bring proceedings on?

p1,01:32:51.560,01:32:55.710,spk_2,a quite a lot was left for subsequent decision and negotiation.

p1,01:32:59.010,01:33:08.950,spk_0,was a framework document. Clearly what happened because there must have been a discussion as to whether it should be Saudi law or Pakistan law but in the end it was no law.
p1,01:33:10.490,01:33:15.560,spk_1,A problem that the land was larger than the permitted limit under the MOU?
p1,01:33:17.190,01:33:43.590,spk_0,"Well with respect, no, I mean the fact that you find you're if you're even in an ordinary situation. If you enter into a development contract and you're asked to buy land, the fact that you buy more land in for your own benefit with respect, unless the sole purpose. But if the dominant purpose of the real purpose of you buying to fulfil a contract?"

p1,01:33:44.770,01:33:54.700,spk_0,we would submit that that shouldn't make any difference. So what is perhaps a more critical area of the fact that
p1,01:33:54.710,01:34:04.380,spk_2,"it was one other document to look at? Whether it was a subsequent to to this 21st November, we covered all the --"
p1,01:34:04.440,01:36:25.100,spk_0,"We're coming to the critical letter. Before I do that, if I may, I would just like to look at the effect with you of the failure to re-promulgate what it really what really happened, Because the background is that my clients entered into a long term project 99 year lease. There was the structure that we've seen the agreement describes. This trust has been having been established under Section 3 of the ordinance, specifically and its continued life with clearly dependent upon the government re-promulgating the ordinance every four months for 99 years, the trust could not perpetuate itself. Its life was dependent upon the government doing it. And so a positive decision in our submission has clearly taken not to reform so that it lacks on the 11th or 12th of December, only three months after the agreement has been signed, it was argued that well this may have been a mistake, and the government didn't know what he's doing. There is two answers to that with respect. First of all, this is a government, and quite frankly, one would assume that the government knew what it was doing. Secondly, if it was a mistake, there is evidence from referred to him, my friends own skeleton, that you can re-promulgate retrospectively so that if they forgot, they could do it subsequently. But there was never any indication that it was their intention to re promulgated. It was clearly the government's intention for whatever reason, and we would submit that it's likely to have been that the change of government decided that it was not appropriate to continue with this project, something it was perfectly entitled to do. But it should have done so by compensating my clients. Having decided this, they then decided not to re promulgate the ordinance, and this emphasis is the control of the government in the government that the government was in effect, the entity responsible for terminating the agreement as between the Trust and Dallah and under French law. As I said at the outset, involvement and behaviour of all parties during the negotiation, the performance and, if applicable."
p1,01:36:25.110,01:36:47.550,spk_3,"So they were inducing a breach of contract. Perhaps they, perhaps the real true cause of action, is an action against the government by taking steps to eradicate or eliminate the trust that's preventing the trust from carrying out its obligations under the contract and generate under English law. It would be a classic example of inducing a rich country"
p1,01:36:47.560,01:37:19.450,spk_0,"indeed, My Lord. But as I say, we are looking here at the French law, and the French law is different. And this is one of the problems which will come to when we're looking at the review is that we are all here, however hard we try to put ourselves into the position of a French judge. Inevitably, there is the the English bias as to how one looks at it and what one has to try very hard to look at it here. From the perspective,"
p1,01:37:19.450,01:37:21.500,spk_3,perhaps you'll be able to enforce the award in France.
p1,01:37:22.090,01:37:23.040,spk_0,"Well, I'll come to that in"
p1,01:37:23.310,01:37:57.650,spk_2,"your case. Wasn't that different from inducement of breach of contract? Because, as I've understood it, the arbitral tribunal decided that the government was not the same as the trust but was nevertheless a party. And then it was held liable in the interim award for the government was held liable for repudiating the contract without it being said inside that it was, it was subject to the obligations of the trust. So that's quite that's not very, very far from inducement."
p1,01:37:57.660,01:38:33.090,spk_0,"Wasn't on that basis the basis upon which it was held liable was Clause 2 in that various grounds, effectively preventing my clients from raising the funds in order to make the agreement effective because of one of the reasons was the failure to provide a clear market mandate. So actually, the liability went to the initial stages of the failure to provide the financing to enable my clients to get the project off the ground."
p1,01:38:33.090,01:38:39.170,spk_2,But the principal holding in the second partial award was repudiation.
p1,01:38:39.360,01:38:51.020,spk_0,"Yes, indeed, the repudiation, effectively beginning in the context of financial, never got further down the line construction. I"
p1,01:38:51.030,01:39:34.320,spk_2,"think the way the tribunal put it and I'm looking at page 34 of tab E in the appendix is that it was a political decision of the government to set trussed up in the first place for specific page page 34 paragraph 12.1 and it's the first full paragraph on the page. It was a political decision of the defendant for specific activities which the defendant wanted to perform and was cancelled also by a political decision of the defendant. That's the sort of point you've been making, really, and the conclusion they draw from all of that is that it was an alter ego, the real party and interests, therefore the proper party to the agreement. That's their conclusion I think."
p1,01:39:34.440,01:40:02.590,spk_0,"Well, I'm going to come to other parts of it as well, because they refer to being an act of sovereignty and political will in a different context. But I was going to if I may take you through only about three page's when you've seen this, to compare the two reasonings rather than jump on selected paragraphs, I think it may be easier for you if I complete this analysis and then take it to the"
p1,01:40:02.600,01:40:03.680,spk_3,two documents.
p1,01:40:07.670,01:40:08.240,spk_1,So
p1,01:40:08.250,01:40:14.680,spk_0,"the reality is that the removal of the trust as a contractual party was the act of the government,"
p1,01:40:16.000,01:40:16.300,spk_2,and
p1,01:40:16.300,01:41:03.080,spk_0,"it must have known the consequences. And it agreed for the purposes of this appeal that upon the collapse, the trust ceased to exist. The government is not a successor to the trust didn't become bound by the rights and obligations of the trust and either the agreement or the arbitration agreement by way of operation of law. And there was no transfer of the agreement or arbitration agreement. The GOP on the trust mark demise so far as my clients concerned, as at one minute past midnight on the 12th December, we were left without a name contracting party without a right of the course against anybody and yet had expended considerable time and resources. On the contrary, when did it dawn"
p1,01:41:03.080,01:41:04.530,spk_3,on your clients that that was the

Six weeks later, the letter arrives, which is the letter of the 20th 19th January 1997 which is the one which both tribunal and the English court, really was the critical letter to the conclusion in this case. But one just has to put it into perspective because the position was once the trust had ceased to be a contracting party. There was no contracting party who could write a letter. The only contracting party could write a letter. It was a contracting party either before or subsequently was the"

Mr. Lutfullah Mufti who wore two hats, originally as secretary of the trust and secretary of the the minister of religious affairs, had come back into the government in December, but he could no longer be minister or secretary of the trust because there wasn't a trust."
p1,01:42:23.750,01:42:27.030,spk_1,You may have thought he was there. He may not have realised that
p1,01:42:27.570,01:42:29.630,spk_0,there's no evidence to that effect.
p1,01:42:33.060,01:42:40.740,spk_1,"We'll look at the documents, but on the face of it, people rise in the name of the trust. They presumably think the trust exists."
p1,01:42:40.890,01:42:52.990,spk_0,"But he didn't, he wrote, you'll see the letter, he wrote, Secretary he didn't write as he could have done. Your point would hold good if he wrote Mr Lutfullah Mufti, Secretary Trust, but he"

p1,01:42:54.370,01:42:56.220,spk_0,That's the point. And he wrote on government
p1,01:42:56.220,01:43:04.060,spk_1,"well, I was referring as much to the complex of documents, including the 20th of January proceedings as just the letter."
p1,01:43:04.500,01:43:54.510,spk_0,"So the way to look at this is when one comes to the position as at the end of December, beginning of 1997. There is no way, with the greatest respect, the government must know whether way will be presumed to know what it's law is that this ordinance had not been re promulgated. The very least one would have assumed it would have been checked before a letter was written. No letters, no evidence of any correspondence. There may have been, but we haven't got it. After the letter of November 1996 until this letter two months later and then out of the blue comes the letter of the 19th of January, which you will see it page 315."

It refers to the agreement of the 10th November pursuant to the above mentioned agreement for the leasing of housing facilities in the holy city of Makkah. You were required within 90 days of the execution of the agreement to get the detailed specifications and drawings approved by the trust. However, since you have failed to see submit the specifications and drawings for the approval of trust today you are in breach of fundamental term of the agreement which, tantamount to a repudiation of the whole agreement, which repudiation is hereby accepted. The question is of course by whom. But just before we get to that on the question of the drawings, it may be a small point, but it may be indicative, as I showed you when we were going through the agreement. Unlike in the case of the MOU, there was no obligation on my clients to actually submit the specifications and drawings for approval. The approval was to be by the trust and these specifications had been approved shortly before by the prime minister. So, in other words, it wasn't my client's obligation. The onus was on the government, and the wording from this is more akin to the wording of the MOU than the wording of the agreement. Moreover, the effectiveness of the agreement was conditional on your arranging requisite finance facility amounting to $100 million within 30 days of the execution of the agreement. And your failure to do so has prevented the agreement from becoming effective, as there is no such agreement in law. This is without prejudice the rights and remedies which may be available to us under the law. Now, the letter is written on the government headed notepaper.

p1,01:47:12.540,01:47:27.930,spk_0,"It doesn't say Secretary, but if you read, if you look at the headed note paper, one would assume without there being any indication that it's secretary on behalf of the trust, that it's the secretary of the Ministry of Religious Affairs."
p1,01:47:29.800,01:47:30.570,spk_3,Was he ever the secretary of the
p1,01:47:30.570,01:48:01.730,spk_0,"trust? Yes. No. He was not the secretary of trust because he would have been the secretary of the trust. I think I'm right in saying date. He would have been the secretary of trust had the trust still existed. But because he came back in mid December and the trust I think had ceased about a week before. In fact, he had never been the secretary of the Trust. But he clearly wasn't the secretary of trust on any view."
p1,01:48:03.670,01:48:06.580,spk_2,Did did the ministry have a secretary?
p1,01:48:07.150,01:48:09.140,spk_0,The ministry had a secretary and
p1,01:48:09.150,01:48:24.070,spk_1,he was both paragraph 18 of the statement of various times. And you say he just wasn't at this time. But the Secretary of the Ministry was automatically secretary of the board of trustees.
p1,01:48:24.090,01:48:31.110,spk_0,"That's right. I'm just sorry I just lost my yes,"
p1,01:48:31.110,01:48:31.600,spk_2,"if you go to the statement of facts,"
p1,01:48:31.990,01:48:34.620,spk_0,you will see that we have set out the dates.
p1,01:48:35.150,01:48:36.160,spk_3,"MORA, that's the Ministry of"
p1,01:48:36.170,01:48:37.440,spk_0,Religious Affairs.
p1,01:48:37.590,01:48:39.770,spk_3,So Secretary could be neither here
p1,01:48:40.300,01:49:22.970,spk_0,"if you go to paragraph, its paragraph 18 of the brief statement of facts. You see, this is what the respondent says. We're not in a position to verify that, but I'm happy for present purposes to accept it as accurate. The position of the Secretary of MORA was held by Mr Mufti between the 26th of August and the 19th of December. So that was before the agreement. But after the MOU and between the 23rd of December and the third of June 1998 and in between, it was held by Mr Kidwai."
p1,01:49:22.970,01:49:23.840,spk_1,
p1,01:49:25.170,01:49:33.250,spk_0,"So in practice, Mr Lutfullah Mufti was never a secretary of the trust."
p1,01:49:34.210,01:49:34.890,spk_2,Becase of the time
p1,01:49:34.890,01:49:36.770,spk_0,"he came, he himself came back in it had gone."
p1,01:49:37.300,01:49:47.420,spk_2,"Yes, well, the trial judge, Justice Aiken's at paragraph 117 seems to accept that he was writing in his capacity as secretary to MORA."
p1,01:49:47.890,01:49:48.430,spk_0,"Yes, he does."
p1,01:49:52.140,01:49:56.000,spk_2,"Well, he adds, whatever he may have thought at the time."
p1,01:49:56.200,01:49:57.120,spk_0,"But,"
p1,01:49:59.530,01:49:59.940,spk_2,"I mean,"
p1,01:49:59.970,01:50:08.630,spk_1,"he on the face of if you read the first paragraph, this the conventional understanding would be that this is the trust alleging a repudiation."
p1,01:50:10.390,01:50:15.400,spk_0,"Well, with respect, My Lord, one might if the trust existed,"
p1,01:50:16.430,01:50:16.590,spk_1,the
p1,01:50:16.600,01:50:20.540,spk_0,trust didn't exist. And if you knew the trust didn't exist

This is what happens afterwards because, he says, it's a clear impossible to get an indication of the state of the mind of the government, at least if a county state of the proceedings were begun on the following day. And you really take us to that, are you?"
p1,01:50:52.300,01:51:05.830,spk_0,"But it's also relevant. Perhaps before I just do that, it's referred to. If I give you a reference a very short reference E's bundle E/B/7 paragraph 2"

But Dallah replied to this letter but replied, the government not trust on the 26th of January denying the allegations. We don't have the letter.

p1,01:51:51.880,01:51:56.930,spk_0,Maybe I'll give you a wrong reference. We'll come to it in a moment. We're moving on to the Pakistan proceedings
p1,01:51:56.940,01:51:57.490,spk_3,briefly.
p1,01:51:57.500,01:52:10.460,spk_0,"But the point being, the only point I'm making there is that the reaction of Dallah was to write back to the government and to ask the government to continue with the contract to deny the repudiation."
p1,01:52:10.460,01:52:11.730,spk_1,Where's the summary of that letter?
p1,01:52:11.940,01:52:14.030,spk_0,"The summary of that letter is in bundle E, it's the Pakistan."
p1,01:52:16.780,01:52:20.360,spk_1,Sorry. It's the same reference you've just given us. I come to it.

p1,01:52:29.250,01:52:34.410,spk_3,your clients were still in a state of ignorance as to the nonexistence of the
p1,01:52:34.410,01:52:37.590,spk_0,trust. That is my understanding. There's no evidence to the
p1,01:52:37.590,01:52:38.080,spk_2,contrary.
p1,01:52:43.150,01:53:00.590,spk_0,"And when asked rhetorically and this is what the French law and are submission would say, what would be the purpose of writing this letter. If the trust had gone and it was the only party had intended to be the trust, the muddled"
p1,01:53:00.590,01:53:01.440,spk_3,"thinking, actually."
p1,01:53:02.230,01:53:20.090,spk_0,"Well, My Lord, I with respect Your Lordship says muddle thinking. But we don't know because there's no evidence, no, and to assume that against my clients in my submission, when the onus is on the government to establish"

p1,01:53:21.290,01:54:49.200,spk_0,"on any of view. What one says about this letter is that it you have here it must, even if we're wrong. As to its interpretation, it is capable of two interpretations. It's not a black and white situation this, and that may be important later when we come to the conditions and it is a very odd letter to write. Whilst one can get the benefit of the doubt government one must remember. It is a government. The government should know whether or not its own legislation is alive, whether the trust exists and to take the muddled thinking point here you have. It's not some with respect, lowly person. In the ministry, you have the minister of religion, the secretary to the minister of religious affairs, who would normally also be the secretary to the trust. One would have thought he is a new person coming into the ministry. He would, even if not himself, would have asked somebody What is the position? Because why I write this letter out of the blue unless there is some reason to do so. And the reason to do so must be in our submission that the government had decided for whatever reason, the new government that they didn't want to pursue this project and one would have assumed that they would have made some inquiries."
p1,01:54:49.580,01:54:53.120,spk_3,It was sort of affirmation of the contract and a repudiation of it at the same time.
p1,01:54:53.120,01:56:02.170,spk_0,"Indeed, by becoming involved in the termination both in the context of removing a contracting party so that if the contract stayed alive, it could only be alive against the government and effectively coming in at this stage and saying, Well, the agreement exists because of your action, You've repudiated it, and now we accept that repudiation so it no longer exists. Under French law, it is our submission that that is sufficient, particularly when you look at the earlier history, but in itself it sufficient to make the government a party to this agreement. It was quite as as the tribunal said it was wholly unnecessary to write this letter. Why, when asked rhetorically, Why write this letter? Unless there was some concern on the part of the government that they themselves were on the hook for potentially liable for some sort of claim by Dallah?"
p1,01:56:04.070,01:56:06.670,spk_2,"Well, the judge didn't agree with that."
p1,01:56:06.850,01:56:07.520,spk_0,Didn't agree.
p1,01:56:08.730,01:56:08.880,spk_1,And
p1,01:56:08.880,01:56:13.330,spk_2,that's because of what he took from the proceedings and the way

It's not a question, but it's quite clear that the government of Pakistan were not adverse to arbitration because they agreed to arbitration as a method of dispute resolution in the MOU, just a small point. But perhaps I just mentioned the Pakistan proceedings. There were three sets of proceedings that are, relevant. The first is the 1997 proceedings. You will see, I perhaps I should have shown you, but at the top of the letter of the 19th of January. There is a fact date, the 20th of January. It looks as if it was faxed on the 20th of January, which is the day that these proceedings were"
p1,01:57:47.530,01:57:48.860,spk_1,started. So
p1,01:57:48.870,01:57:59.090,spk_0,"it may or may not really that they were, the letter was part of the preparation"
p1,01:57:59.100,01:58:00.270,spk_2,for
p1,01:58:00.280,01:59:28.150,spk_0,"these proceedings. There's no actual evidence before the court as to why they were launched in Pakistan. In the name of the trust, the only facts that we know are one that I mentioned that Mr Nackvi was chasing members of the government to the a secretary of MORA changed after the change of government. Mr. Lutfullah Mufti became its secretary. And you've seen the dates, proceedings. The proceedings rely on the letter in order to assert an alleged acceptance to an alleged repudiation and the proceeding sort of declaration that the agreement was repudiated and sought an injunction. So the letter was integral to the ability to bring the proceedings and again whilst you can, because there is no evidence whilst, yes, One way of looking at it is as the judge said, Well, this is the clearest indication as to why the government did what it did. On the other hand, one could take a more cynical view and say that this was a tactic on the part of the government to bring proceedings in order. Both embraces to make sure that there would be no proceedings against the new government for something which would be undertaken by a previous administration."

You see, it's the Trust established under Section 3 against Dallah, and the suit is for a declaration to the effect that the Agreement stood repudiated on account of the court of the defendant.

Paragraph 5, the purpose of launching the aforesaid Makkah housing project, the parties entered into an agreement, dated the 10th of September. And then go back to, jump to paragraph 10, but under Clause 4 of the Agreement, the defendant was also under an obligation to submit detailed specifications, but the defendant failed to comply with this fundamental term of the Agreement, which tantamount to a repudiation of the whole agreement, which repudiation was accordingly accepted by the plaintiff vide it's letter of the 19th of January, that on account of the repudiation, the same is no longer binding on the plaintiff, defendant not entitled to raise any claim or right against the plaintiff under the Agreement. 13, the cause of action accrued to the plaintiff against the defendant at Islamabad.

Obviously, it is clearly based on the letter because the letter gives the cause of action. Yes. And, secondly, what is being sought, effectively, is an order to say, not only, a declaration that there are no contractual relations with the plaintiff and an injunction. Remembering, of course, that at this stage, Dallah has in fact done nothing other than write the letter of the 20th of November, asking the Government what's happening about the financing. And you get a similar document, suit for declaration, in tab 2 number 5, pending the decision of the suit, if the respondent is not restrained from representing or holding out that the applicant has any contractual relationship with it, the applicant would suffer an irreparable loss unspecified. And then, if you go to 4, you have Mr Muhammad Lutfullah being Secretary Board of Trustees Awami Trust, slash Secretary Religious Affairs Division government of Pakistan, to hereby take oath and state as follows, read the application moved under Section 151, this is by Dallah, I'm fully conversant the facts of the case into the reply had been prepared under my instructions. The facts stated in the aforementioned reply are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. The allegations made in the affidavit against Awami Trust absolutely fall from the same vehemently denied. The facts stated in the plaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief, and the same are reiterated."

p2,00:05:49.930,00:06:00.340,spk_4,"It would be quite interesting to see it, wouldn't it? The application referred to in tab 3 and tab 4 and the affidavit in support of --"
p2,00:06:00.350,00:06:05.220,spk_1,"I think it was an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, I'm afraid I --"
p2,00:06:05.220,00:06:07.550,spk_4,But it must have been addressed to the Trust.
p2,00:06:08.640,00:06:15.490,spk_1,"Well, one would assume it may well have been, but of course it might -- at that stage, my clients may well not have known that the Trust didn't exist."
p2,00:06:15.500,00:06:25.560,spk_4,So there can't be any common intention at that stage to make the Government of Pakistan a party.
p2,00:06:26.040,00:07:00.750,spk_1,"Well, with respect, My Lord, at that stage, this was an urgent application injunction. My clients would be responding to proceedings which were brought against it. You will see if, I go on in the second, that the issue then it does arise that the Trust is not -- no longer in existence. And if you look -- we don't know what went on, but what we do know, is at flag five. The judge says, the counsel for the defendant had objected at the last date -- Where"

p2,00:07:16.380,00:07:21.640,spk_4,"arbitration? To go to arbitration. Yes. So, it was an application against the Trust to go to arbitration as I think --"
p2,00:07:22.300,00:07:23.390,spk_1,Yes. As I understand it with Lord Mance --
p2,00:07:23.720,00:07:29.180,spk_2,On the basis that the contract was between the Trust and Dallah?
p2,00:07:30.930,00:07:38.200,spk_1,"Well, My Lord, that maybe in relation to the position of Trust. But of course, remembering at that --"
p2,00:07:38.210,00:07:40.010,spk_2,I was talking about the position of Dallah.
p2,00:07:40.190,00:07:49.760,spk_1,Dallah would respond in the proceedings to the claimant who had brought the proceedings. It is true that at that stage --
p2,00:07:49.760,00:07:52.320,spk_2,Which was the Trust. At any rate appeared to be the Trust.
p2,00:07:52.330,00:07:57.480,spk_1,"But it is true that at that stage, they did not join the Government."
p2,00:07:57.490,00:08:08.820,spk_2,"So, everything that happened in these proceedings to date was consistent with the idea that the two parties to the contract were A, Dallah, and B, the Trust. That's on the face of it."
p2,00:08:09.250,00:08:18.720,spk_1,"Well, on the face of it. But it may be consistent that the Trust was a party. May not be the sole party. But also, My Lord --"
p2,00:08:18.720,00:08:20.360,spk_2,That's why it would be interesting to see the application.
p2,00:08:20.610,00:08:23.960,spk_1,"Well, I can't -- I mean we may be able to find it, but I --"
p2,00:08:23.970,00:08:27.550,spk_4,It must be. On the face of it presumably exists somewhere.
p2,00:08:27.560,00:08:30.170,spk_1,We will endeavour to see if we can find it. What are we

p2,00:08:44.980,00:08:45.680,spk_1,I'm sorry. Tab -- yes.
p2,00:08:46.450,00:08:50.150,spk_0,"Because I thought you mentioned tab 5. Tab 5, yes. Was I wrong?"
p2,00:08:50.330,00:09:01.730,spk_1,Counsel for the defendant objected to the last date of hearing that Awami Trust was established under Section 3 of the Ordinance 1996. But at the time of the institution of this --
p2,00:09:01.740,00:09:04.810,spk_3,"Sorry to interrupt, but this is the -- this is the judge, is it?"
p2,00:09:04.820,00:09:05.990,spk_1,"This is the judge, yes."
p2,00:09:06.000,00:09:09.570,spk_3,"On what form of application, do we know that?"
p2,00:09:09.580,00:09:19.280,spk_1,"This -- I understood -- I've always understood, to be the judgment in relation to this suit for the declaration starting on the 20th of January 1997."
p2,00:09:19.290,00:09:26.560,spk_3,"Yeah, I'm not saying that's not right. What is it, a judgment on the application for a stay or or what?"
p2,00:09:27.240,00:09:39.100,spk_1,"Well, I think it's a judgement on the application for everything, because effectively, what he says is that the claim cannot be maintained because the Trust no longer exists."
p2,00:09:39.100,00:09:40.350,spk_2,And who was arguing that?
p2,00:09:40.840,00:09:48.600,spk_1,"Well, it looks as if -- it's not clear, it looks as if it was raised by Dallah. But again, it's not clear from what we have."
p2,00:09:48.610,00:09:55.390,spk_4,"Well, it seems to be crystal clear. Dallah raised this point at a late stage in the proceedings and won on it."
p2,00:09:56.140,00:11:52.040,spk_1,"That seems to be the position. Doubt, as objected, was established, but at the time of the institution of this suit, the Ordinance had elapsed. And it may be the position, I don't know, that at that -- when they first put in the response, after all it they were asking for an urgent injunction, the position may not have become clear, but it was obviously became clear later. But at the time the institution of this suit, the Ordinance had lapsed. There was no more ordinance in the field, and suit had been filed on behalf of the same, which was formed when the Ordinance -- under the Ordinance, after the lapse of Ordinance. Awami Trust's plaintiff in the suit, after the lapse of the Ordinance, the present plaintiff was no more a legal person in the eye of the law. This suit had been filed after the lapse of this Ordinance. In other words, suit has not been filed by the legal person as plaintiffs after the lapse of the Trust Ordinance. Counsel for the plaintiffs succeeded -- conceded from the arguments that suit had been filed after the lapse of the Trust Ordinance and the plaintiff in this suit is Awami Trust established under Article 3 of the Ordinance 1996. The counsel for the plaintiff has argued that after the lapse of the Ordinance, the thing during the light of the Trust do not stand abated. But this became alive even after the lapse of the Ordinance so no suit has been filed by the competent legal person. After hearing arguments of the counsel for the parties, I'm of view that the lapse of the Trust Ordinance, the present plaintiff Trust, is no more the legal person because the present plaintiff has legal entity during -- only during the life of the Ordinance. When the Ordinance was lapsed, the present person was no more legal person and suit was filed after the lapse of the Ordinance by the Trust. Moreover, the things done during the Ordinance can be sued and can sue by the parent department"
p2,00:11:52.050,00:11:52.810,spk_0,from
p2,00:11:52.810,00:12:28.400,spk_1,"whom this Ordinance was issued by the Government and that was Ministry for Religious Affairs. The suit should have been filed by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. In this way, I hold that the present plaintiff was no more legal person at the time of the institute of the suit because the Ordinance had lapsed at the time of the institution of the suit. Before parting with this order, I observe that the liabilities and duties against the present defendant can be agitated by the Ministry of Religious Affairs government of Pakistan if any. Since the suit has not been filed by the legal person, the present plaintiff is no more a plaintiff in the eye of the law. Suit is dismissed. I'll be consigned to the record."
p2,00:12:29.540,00:12:30.020,spk_2,The record rules.
p2,00:12:30.370,00:12:32.050,spk_1,It
p2,00:12:32.050,00:12:35.130,spk_3,looks as though the -- it looks as though it was your clients who took the point.
p2,00:12:35.140,00:12:43.190,spk_1,It looks as if my clients took the point. We then move forward to --
p2,00:12:43.200,00:12:47.190,spk_2,Slightly less clear what point the Government was taking but still.
p2,00:12:48.180,00:12:49.330,spk_4,"Well, the Government wasn't --"
p2,00:12:49.500,00:12:53.060,spk_0,"Well, who was the party -- Was it somebody appearing for the Trust?"
p2,00:12:53.440,00:13:25.320,spk_4,"Yes. The Trust argument was that after the lapse of the Ordinance, the thing done during the life of the Trust Ordinance do not stand abated. But, this remain alive even after the lapse of the Ordinance, so, the suit has been filed by the competent legal person. And that's -- I mean, one can understand the argument that it's a rather strange proposition that something just disappears into thin air and all its rights and obligations are enforceable against no one."
p2,00:13:25.750,00:13:45.100,spk_1,"Let us see, if we may, what happens in the next few months. Nothing happens until the following year on the 2nd of June, this [inaudible] on the 21st of February, the Government brings identical proceedings to the 1997 proceedings seeking --"
p2,00:13:46.690,00:13:50.190,spk_3,I'm so sorry. What is the date of the -- of tab 5?
p2,00:13:50.360,00:13:52.710,spk_1,I think it's the 21st of February 1998.
p2,00:13:53.030,00:13:54.070,spk_3,Thank you.
p2,00:13:55.940,00:16:46.750,spk_1,"So, on the second of June, some three months later, having done nothing, the Government brings identical proceedings to the 1997 proceedings seeking identical relief, changing some of the wording which is consistent with the change of plaintiff. And so again, if you go to flag B1, you see the plaintiff name changes. At paragraph 1, the Trust was a body corporate the Secretary of Religious Affairs government of Pakistan was the Secretary constituted under Section 5. Then 2, that under Article 89 the aforesaid Ordinance stood lapse on expiry of four months from the date of its promulgation. As such, the Trust established no longer remained in field. The present suit is, therefore, being filed by Pakistan who issued the said Ordinance. And then if you jump to 6, The parties, the party now, of course, being the Government, entered into an agreement dated the 10th of September at Islamabad. 7, to be effective as from the date, the defendant receives, again, the advanced lease payment from the Trust and submits the requisite performance bond in the terms of the Agreement. But as per Clause 2, and you can see it's a scissors and paste job, the plaintiff Trust was required to pay a lump sum. 9, that the payment of the above mentioned advanced by the plaintiff i.e. the GOP not the plaintiff Trust in this case. But if you jump to 11, it's perhaps the clearest. Under Clause 4 of the Agreement, the defendant was also under an obligation to submit detailed specifications and drawings of the Makkah housing project, but the defendant complied -- failed to comply with this fundamental term of the Agreement which tantamount to a repudiation of the whole agreement which repudiation was accordingly accepted by the plaintiff. On this case, the plaintiff is the Government in its letter of the 19th of January 1997, and that on account of the repudiation of the Agreement, the same is no longer binding on the plaintiff, the Government, and the defendant is not entitled to raise any claim. And in 14, that in January 1997 refers to the Trust instituting a suit was, however, dismissed the order of the 24th of February, and sets out the grounds, and then over the page, The learned Civil Court observed, however, that liabilities and duties against the defendant can be agitated by the Government of Pakistan. That the cause of action accrued to the plaintiff against the defendant at Islamabad. Firstly, when the defendant, the Government, entered into the Agreement and thereafter when it defaulted in fulfilling the"
p2,00:16:47.000,00:16:48.510,spk_2,pre-conditions
p2,00:16:48.510,00:17:10.839,spk_1,"of the Agreement, and the same was repudiated, and finally, in January 1997, when it refused to treat the Agreement as repudiated. And finally, 16, the Agreement was entered into between the parties at Islamabad, cause of action also accrued to the plaintiff against the defendant at Islamabad, therefore, this learned court has jurisdiction to entertain and try this suit."
p2,00:17:10.850,00:17:12.110,spk_0,The defendant is actually Dallah isn't it?
p2,00:17:13.510,00:17:14.010,spk_1,"The defendant, yes --"
p2,00:17:14.860,00:17:17.250,spk_0,"Well certainly, you're quite right that paragraph 15 refers to the plaintiff."
p2,00:17:18.010,00:17:18.670,spk_1,Yes.
p2,00:17:19.439,00:17:20.620,spk_0,Which is the overnment.
p2,00:17:21.550,00:17:27.170,spk_2,"Meanwhile, what had happened to this -- this was all still part of the Section 34 proceedings was it or --"
p2,00:17:27.720,00:17:29.160,spk_1,"Well, the earlier proceedings are completely lapsed."
p2,00:17:29.640,00:17:30.830,spk_2,Including the application --
p2,00:17:30.840,00:17:36.060,spk_1,"As far as I'm aware. And then started again in 1990 -- I'm not going to trouble you with -- Well, they"
p2,00:17:36.430,00:17:41.720,spk_4,"lapse because they [inaudible], once there's no Trust."
p2,00:17:41.880,00:17:49.460,spk_2,"Anyway, you say this is a clear and unequivocal representation on the part of the Government, that it was or had by now become a party to the Agreement."
p2,00:17:49.940,00:17:59.360,spk_1,"Indeed, and it's verified, again, by the same gentleman who verified the facts in the previous --"
p2,00:17:59.740,00:18:19.700,spk_5,"Going back paragraph 6 Mr Justice Atkins said that that wasn't an admission that the Government was a party because if you have to read it as a whole, it says the parties entered into an agreement at Islamabad and therefore is purely descriptive of the past in Dallah."
p2,00:18:20.270,00:18:53.170,spk_1,"I think what Mr Justice Atkins was saying, was that was in order to find jurisdiction that they referred to Islamabad. One has to accept that it's a bad scissors and paste job because sometimes the old words are in. But the fact is, the underlying point about it, in our submission, is in order to fund the cause of action, they had to rely on the letter because the letter was the acceptance of the repudiation, which then entitles them to say there is no agreement and then entitles them to seek a declaration to that effect and an injunction."
p2,00:18:53.640,00:18:55.040,spk_6,The whole basis of
p2,00:18:55.050,00:19:13.710,spk_4,this cause of action is a thesis derived from the judgment in the first set of proceedings to the effect that the Government of Pakistan can agitate liabilities and duties against the defendant that were the Trust. It's not saying we were originally a party. It's
p2,00:19:13.720,00:19:16.750,spk_6,proposing some sort of principle
p2,00:19:16.750,00:19:19.100,spk_4,of particular succession.
p2,00:19:19.410,00:20:03.720,spk_1,"Well, with respect, if the wording of the earlier proceedings, where the Trust was stated to be a party, is reproduced virtually verbatim, and somebody verifies the first proceedings, saying it was the Trust that's effectively sent the letter, and then comes along a year later and says it was the Government who sent the letter, it must, in our submission, at the very least, undermine the reliance upon what was said in the earlier proceedings. Whatever the reason for him doing it, the fact is he now has to say that the letter was accepted, the repudiation was accepted, by the Government."
p2,00:20:03.730,00:20:05.990,spk_4,It might undermine what he says in these proceedings.
p2,00:20:06.840,00:20:09.510,spk_6,Just because they're inconsistent
p2,00:20:09.510,00:20:30.950,spk_4,"doesn't mean, say, the first one is wrong. As you yourself said at the second set of proceedings, a pretty rough pleading with references to the Trust, the plaintiff, the plaintiff Trust and then the explanation as to how they're actually proposing to put the case in quotation from the judge, I would have thought."
p2,00:20:31.540,00:20:50.550,spk_1,"Well, My Lord, of course I accept Your Lord's argument, but at the same time you have and you have the verification, I haven't taken you to it, at flag three. And also,"
p2,00:20:51.240,00:20:51.700,spk_4,I think the main one --
p2,00:20:51.710,00:20:57.780,spk_1,"yes, flag three."
p2,00:20:58.050,00:20:59.540,spk_0,Flag three in?
p2,00:20:59.580,00:21:10.850,spk_1,"In B three. It's first, number one, The facts stating the accompanying application and those details in the plaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief."
p2,00:21:10.860,00:21:15.790,spk_0,Which application is that referring to? The second one. Is it
p2,00:21:15.790,00:21:21.560,spk_1,referring to tab 2? It's referring to -- It's referring to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan against Dallah.
p2,00:21:22.140,00:21:34.890,spk_0,Yes. Because tab 2 is something that the judge refers to as casting light on what we've just been looking at in the second set of proceedings isn't he because
p2,00:21:34.980,00:21:35.960,spk_1,here
p2,00:21:35.960,00:21:44.450,spk_0,"we are just a short time later, the Government really asking for an injunction on the basis that they weren't a party to the Agreement at"
p2,00:21:44.450,00:21:51.840,spk_1,"all. What -- if you look at the flag two, Clause 4,"
p2,00:21:52.270,00:21:53.620,spk_0,what
p2,00:21:53.620,00:22:30.480,spk_1,"it says is, on account of the repudiation of the Agreement the respondent is not entitled to claim any right against the applicant under the aforesaid agreement, or represent or hold out that the applicant has any contractual relationship with it. Well, if it was never a party, why when asked rhetorically does it need that? Why does the Government need to -- I mean I take Lord Mance's point obviously, but when asked why does the Government need to go back to the court if the Government is not a party"
p2,00:22:31.240,00:22:31.520,spk_4,and
p2,00:22:31.520,00:22:39.640,spk_1,"to bring these proceedings. And the answer in our submission is quite simple. And that is, which what we'll see in a moment, 3 days before"
p2,00:22:39.650,00:22:40.890,spk_6,proceedings
p2,00:22:40.890,00:23:39.210,spk_1,"were started in -- under the ICC and were served on the government, and the government, when it made this initial application in 1998, did not tell the court of the requests for arbitration which had been served upon it. So, one has to look at it in the round. It's not simply that the court says, You've got the wrong party, try again. One's got to look behind that to find out why they were doing it. Because if they're right and there is no trust, there's no need. Not only is there no need to bring the letter -- write a letter, there's no need to bring the proceedings. Because by then they knew that the Ordinance had not been promulgated on any view because the judge -- it has been argued in court. So, by 1998 that can not possibly have been any confusion. And all this comes back in our submission."
p2,00:23:39.380,00:23:40.250,spk_4,"So, they"
p2,00:23:40.260,00:24:20.100,spk_6,"might actually be able to say, if they wanted to, that you were estopped from denying, this is looking at it in common law terms, you were estopped from denying that the Government of Pakistan was a party because they relied upon your commencement of arbitration to commence these counter proceedings. But that rather fanciful idea, they certainly don't want to say that. And you can't -- can you -- you haven't said that you -- that they are stopped from denying that they are parties by reference to anything you did in reliance on these proceedings. That's the one thing that hasn't been alleged in this case."
p2,00:24:20.860,00:24:40.680,spk_1,"Well, if you look at -- I was going to take it because I think Lord Hope was asking earlier. If you go to flag four you'll see where the information that I put to you comes from. And this is an application by Dallah under Section 3 of the 1937 Act. What's the"
p2,00:24:40.690,00:24:41.470,spk_2,date of this?
p2,00:24:41.480,00:24:42.930,spk_1,This is --
p2,00:24:43.660,00:24:45.110,spk_0,it has June 1998 .
p2,00:24:45.120,00:24:48.440,spk_1,June 1998. So it's in the --
p2,00:24:48.450,00:24:49.840,spk_2,"So, this is the next lot? This is lot two."
p2,00:24:51.390,00:27:01.910,spk_1,"There are several. You'll be pleased to know I'm not taking to all the proceedings. But there was a 1997 to 1998 and a 1999 set which went on and on, but I'm really concentrating on the first two. This is -- refers to a suit, which is pending. This is my clients, where the respondent plaintiffs allege that the Agreement entered into between the Trust repudiated [inaudible] default is a consequential relief, a permanent injunction has been sought by the plaintiff to [inaudible] the defendants from claiming any rights under the contract. Notice of the court by facts, it was received by the defendant directing appearance. So, it was an application which was made ex parte or without notice on June the 13th. The present application is being filed without any loss of time without taking any step in the proceedings. The proceedings in the present suit are liable to be stayed for facts contained in the application of provisions of Section 3 of the Arbitration Act. Then it refers to the arbitration tools and Article 25 of the contract that, In pursuance of the agreement has already filed against the plaintiff, a memorandum claim in the International Court of Arbitration, petitioners left a letter of that court dated the 25th of May. The ICC issued a notice process to the present respondent plaintiff, that's the Government, on the 29th of May 1998, along with the annexes detailed in the letter, which was received by the plaintiff on the same day, which has been acknowledged by the plaintiff in its letter, referred to herein that, The plaintiff on receipt of the notice hastily proceeded to file the present suit in this honourable court along with an application for interim relief, without disclosing to the court about the proceedings filed by the defendant petitioner in the International Court of the ICC of which notice had been received by the plaintiff prior to the filing of the suit. And then it talks about mala fides, which I won't go on with. The other point that the --"
p2,00:27:01.920,00:27:08.670,spk_2,"Hang on, this is all in the context of Dallah's request for arbitration against the Ministry is it? Yes. Where do we see that?"
p2,00:27:09.140,00:27:17.420,spk_1,"Well, Dallah -- what had happened is Dallah had already, just before these proceedings had launched, Dallah had commenced proceedings against the"
p2,00:27:17.430,00:27:17.960,spk_4,government
p2,00:27:18.740,00:27:19.640,spk_1,in the ICC?
p2,00:27:19.820,00:27:21.110,spk_2,"Yes, where do we see that?"
p2,00:27:21.120,00:27:24.060,spk_1,"Well, that's clear, I thought -- Where"
p2,00:27:24.060,00:27:25.310,spk_2,do we see the proceedings?
p2,00:27:25.400,00:27:32.990,spk_1,"Oh well, that's in a different bundle I was coming to that in a moment -- [crosstalk] -- moving from bundle to bundle. This indicates --"
p2,00:27:33.000,00:27:41.780,spk_2,"Anyway so they make an application -- your clients make an application for arbitration to the ICC against the Government, is that right?"
p2,00:27:41.790,00:27:49.510,spk_1,"Against the Government. That is served on the Government. Two days later, the Government made this application for the court without telling the court."
p2,00:27:49.510,00:27:57.770,spk_2,"And you say that they accept that here, do they? Or at least they accept that they're a party, do they? In the document that I'm looking at. Tab --"
p2,00:27:57.940,00:31:29.300,spk_1,"In the document that you're looking at, there is reference to the letter -- to the request for arbitration. The request for arbitration is clearly made against the Government and not against the Trust. Yep. And what I'm saying is the sequences application following the letter of the 2016 January, which I'll come to in a second, where we had told the Government in response to their letter of the 20th --19th of January, we would issue proceedings. We did issue proceedings at the ICC against the Government. It was served on the Government. When the Government received it, they went off to the court having done nothing in the last three months and started the proceedings all over again. But this -- but they didn't mention, because it was an ex parte application, that in the interim they had actually received arbitration proceedings against them. We then come back in on notice and raise this point and that's where this comes. And the point being, again, that in order to fund these proceedings, because the proceedings could not -- it wasn't a cause of action without -- the letter was integral, and the contents of the letter were integral to the plaint in both the first, 1997 on the second, 1998. And what this does, at the very least, is that it cast doubt on what was going through the mind of Mr Lutfullah Mufti in 1997 which the judge places so much reliance upon. Because here's the same gentleman, now in a different scenario, saying something completely different. And we say, realistically, you cannot place all this weight on what happened in 1997. You have to look at it in the round. And it's not -- just as my learned friend without any evidence, tries to say, as I think Lord Clarke, it may be Lord Mance had said, Well, maybe Mr Lutfullah Mufti made a mistake. The same, you can also say, but here's a government, in effect taking using legal action tactically to ensure belt and braces that now having made sure that the Trust isn't a party, wants to make quite sure that Dallah, who, after all, are chasing them and responded in the subsequently in the letter to the Government to get on with it, don't try and make life difficult for the Government. And the easiest way is really a declaration of non-justiciability or whatever to say that's the end of it. And the Pakistan courts would then, they hope, say that there wasn't a contract and the Government would then be clear of it. Yes. So, we say, therefore, that the 1997 proceedings cannot be as cast iron as Mr Justice Akin said. You have to, under the French test, look at the whole scenario. You can't stop in 1997. You will have to go on to 1998. Well, there come a point where you"
p2,00:31:29.300,00:31:31.870,spk_0,stop -- but he didn't stop at 1997 at all.
p2,00:31:32.500,00:32:41.690,spk_1,"No he didn't and I'll explain what he said, of course, that the 1998 proceedings didn't proceed further. But there are two points on that. One is what one is looking at is not the legal consequence of these proceedings, but the conduct in the proceedings as evidence of behaviour of the Government, from which you can determine, under French law, a subjective intention. So, what legally happened, to one extent -- sense is irrelevant, because what you're looking at is the conduct of the parties. And that's why the inconsistent affidavit on the inconsistent pleadings, in our submission, is a relevant factor. The very least, it undermines the reliability of the earlier affidavit upon which Mr Justice Akins then was relied. And I'm just going to take you to the passage, which deals with the letter of the 26th of April -- sorry the 26th of January, which I told Lord Hope I would come to. Yes."

It was specifically mentioned that if the plaintiff respondent failed to comply with the aforesaid requisitions, the defendant appellant left -- shall be left with no option but to enforce all the rights and remedies available to it under the Agreement and law, which would include reference to arbitration under the ICC Paris without any further notice. It's important to note that before the aforementioned letter of January 19th 1997, the Ordinance had lapsed by operation of law and, as a result, thereof AHT and all the office bearers, including the Secretary, ceased to hold office."

p2,00:34:29.480,00:34:44.399,spk_6,"it. You said it was referred to the Government, but there's nothing to demonstrate that that's the case. It could just as well have been written under the misapprehension, which I think you accept your clients had, that the Trust continued to exist."
p2,00:34:45.190,00:34:53.540,spk_1,Except it says that it refers to the plaintiff in these proceedings -- You
p2,00:34:53.540,00:35:11.690,spk_6,"may be making the same blurring of identity of the plaintiffs, since at this point, these are proceedings where the Government is asserting that it has succeeded to the Trust and one can't deduce very much from a reference to the plaintiff, can they?"
p2,00:35:11.930,00:35:21.750,spk_1,"Well say this, that the threat was to bring proceedings in the ICC against them and the proceedings were brought against the Government, not the Trust."

p2,00:35:48.730,00:36:00.560,spk_6,we do note is at tab 6 the actual decision in the second set of proceedings was that the Government of Pakistan was wrong to allege that it was the successor or had become parties to --
p2,00:36:00.620,00:36:11.500,spk_1,"What happened, My Lord, is that there was then an appeal. My clients lost initially. They then appealed."
p2,00:36:11.580,00:36:15.770,spk_3,Where is the judgement where they lost?
p2,00:36:15.790,00:36:18.520,spk_0,It's tab 6. It's in tab 6.
p2,00:36:18.520,00:36:21.920,spk_6,It's really the foot of page 32 and the top of 33.
p2,00:36:23.430,00:36:28.650,spk_1,"I mean, I can take you to it in detail, but I wasn't -- Well,"
p2,00:36:28.650,00:36:29.460,spk_6,I think these work.
p2,00:36:29.580,00:36:36.350,spk_1,"Indeed. I'm only anxious not to detain you too long on the facts. If one goes back to paragraph 3,"
p2,00:36:36.400,00:36:53.950,spk_3,"I'm sorry to take you back a little bit but the -- in tab 5 is the response to the application for a stay, is that right?"
p2,00:36:54.430,00:36:56.350,spk_1,Yes.
p2,00:36:57.640,00:37:27.010,spk_3,"And they seem to be taking two points, is this right? The first point they take page 27, 28, There is no valid and effective agreement between the parties, appears to be on the basis that the Agreement never came into effect because Dallah never got around to setting up the finance."
p2,00:37:28.230,00:37:54.960,spk_1,"Well, yes, because by now the application -- an application had been made with my clients now coming in on notice to stay the proceedings. Remember, unlike the earlier applications to stay, by the time you get to 1998 there were arbitration proceedings on foot."
p2,00:37:55.730,00:37:58.450,spk_3,"Yes, I'm not"

p2,00:37:59.260,00:38:41.640,spk_3,"not challenging that. I'm just looking at the points that appeared to be made on behalf of the -- of Pakistan. Point number one, is this right? Paragraph 3 of this reply is, well, there's no question of a stay, because there never was an effective agreement in the first place and the reason there wasn't an effective agreement in the first place is because if you look at the Agreement, it says it will only come into effect when certain things are done and Dallah didn't do them. So, that's the end of the story. They do then seem to be saying,"
p2,00:38:42.320,00:38:42.520,spk_1,
p2,00:38:43.220,00:38:50.450,spk_3,that there is a difference between the

p2,00:38:52.420,00:38:58.300,spk_3,"Republic of Pakistan and the Ministry of Religious Affairs, is that"
p2,00:38:58.300,00:39:10.270,spk_1,right? That was a point that was taken as to -- that we'd sued the wrong party in the -- before the tribunal. And the tribunal dismissed that.
p2,00:39:10.990,00:39:19.590,spk_3,"Sued the wrong party in the sense that it shouldn't have been the Ministry of Religious Affairs, it should have been the Islamic Republic of Pakistan."
p2,00:39:19.600,00:39:27.880,spk_1,"Yes, yes, yes. But in fact, the phrase that we used for the title was correct."
p2,00:39:27.890,00:39:33.250,spk_3,"So far, say up to tab 5,"
p2,00:39:34.080,00:39:34.260,spk_4,the
p2,00:39:34.260,00:39:40.040,spk_3,point isn't taken that the only party to the Agreement is Dallah.
p2,00:39:41.320,00:39:42.350,spk_1,Dallah?
p2,00:39:42.350,00:39:45.840,spk_3,That sorry is the Trust. I beg your pardon.
p2,00:39:47.100,00:40:33.740,spk_1,"This is the point. In these proceedings what happens again is, as Lord Saville has said, there is nothing which says that the Government is not a party and the Trust is, or was all material times was the party. If the Government is coming in bringing these proceedings and what you will see, what happens is that my clients then bring this stay, they respond in this way the judge dismisses my client's application. When my clients seek to appeal, the Government then, presumably realising the problem they're getting themselves into, withdraw the application on the basis of quote unquote a formal defect."
p2,00:40:34.310,00:41:05.710,spk_3,"Right, well, I was trying to catch up with you, I think. So, I'm right, am I? As far as tab 5 is concerned, it's the Government of Pakistan takes two points. One, an agreement never came into effect, and it never came to in effect because Dallah didn't get around to providing the finance. Is that right? That's point number one. So, you can forget about a stay because there never was an enforceable agreement. Never came into effect."
p2,00:41:05.720,00:41:16.090,spk_1,"Indeed, I think it actually, in fairness, goes further, because it refers to refers to Clause 2, 3, and 4. I think it would cover the plans, which was part of the repudiation [inaudible] as well."
p2,00:41:17.180,00:41:19.260,spk_3,I'm sorry I didn't follow that.
p2,00:41:19.270,00:41:24.210,spk_1,It refers at the top -- just to make sure it's not unclear --
p2,00:41:24.220,00:41:25.660,spk_3,I was looking at page 28.
p2,00:41:25.670,00:41:36.710,spk_1,"Yes, but at the top Your Lordship says, Not become effective on account the defendant to fulfil the prerequisites. I think, I may have misheard you, Your Lordship said the financing, it in fact, goes a bit further than"
p2,00:41:36.710,00:42:20.330,spk_3,"that. I'm sorry, that was a shorthand. There were various other bits and pieces that it said going back to the letter of the 19th of January that Dallah had not done, as a result of which the Agreement was ineffective. That's one. Point two is you brought arbitration proceedings against the wrong party, because you brought them against the Ministry of Religious Affairs, should have been against the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, as I understand it. Yes. Right. I'm sorry to be so slow about this. So what happens -- what happens next? There's some hearing on this or what? Well,"
p2,00:42:20.680,00:42:54.660,spk_1,"insofar as we can tell, there is a hearing because there's then a judgment at flag six. I don't know whether Your Lordships rather for speed would prefer just to read it yourself or I can read it out. I'm in your hands. I can start if you want at paragraph 3, but you may just want to glance down the early bit, which sets out the history."
p2,00:42:56.250,00:42:56.930,spk_2,Really
p2,00:42:56.930,00:44:36.980,spk_1,"the last -- perhaps the last sentence of the first introductory paragraph, Through the present suit the plaintiff has sought declaration to the effect that the Agreement has not become effective and stood repudiated on account of the non-fulfilment of prerequisite, and that the defendant is not entitled to claim any right under the said agreement against Pakistan. Defendant filed application under Section 3, read with Section 34 Arbitration Act, seeking a stay on the ground that under Clause 23 of the Agreement, the dispute arising out of the Agreement is liable to be settled by arbitration by the ICC in Paris and under Clause 25, Trust has wave objections, sighting of the venue. They further submitted the defendant already filed his claim in the ICC and notice to that this effect has been served on the plaintiff i.e. the Government. The plaintiff respondent contested the application, it was submitted to exist no valid and effective agreement between the parties and that the proceedings initiated by the defendant in the ICC are against the Ministry of Religious Affairs and not against the Government of Pakistan. It was further submitted, that process, if any, was issued in the name of Ministry of Religious Affairs and not the present plaintiff. Just pausing that, to add to that, when we come to look at what happened in the ICC, you will see that one of the points the Tribunal picked up on was that in the initial stages, really, Lord Saville's point, it wasn't actually stated that the arbitration was again -- should not be proceeded against the Government. All that was served on the ICC was the injunction, asking the ICC not to proceed with the arbitration. Do we"
p2,00:44:36.980,00:44:40.700,spk_5,"need more than the summary in paragraph 46 with the agreed statements of facts? My Lord, Your Lordship may be right, I've just lost my --"

p2,00:45:38.010,00:45:41.810,spk_0,I'm just wondering where we go from here. Do we need any more of this bundle?
p2,00:45:42.310,00:46:22.300,spk_1,"I don't think so, My Lord, my learned friend will take you to the 1999 proceedings. I don't propose to do so. I just make this comment, that in the context of the 99 proceedings and obviously in the context of any judgment in relation to the facts, what this court is looking at is how the facts pan out according to French law, the judge in Pakistan will, of course, be determining, according to Pakistan law. Just to ask you to bear that in mind if and when my learned friend takes you to any further documents in relation to the 1999 proceedings."
p2,00:46:23.100,00:46:27.890,spk_4,What issues will be determined under Pakistan law?
p2,00:46:27.900,00:46:31.560,spk_1,My learned friend will be taking you to a judgment in the 1999 proceedings
p2,00:46:31.560,00:46:32.800,spk_2,which
p2,00:46:32.800,00:46:36.000,spk_1,various findings were made as to who was and who wasn't a party -- [crosstalk] --
p2,00:46:39.030,00:46:54.460,spk_6,"It's not suggest they give rise to an issue estoppel. And indeed, it's rather odd that the judge went as far as he did in making apparent findings in the 1999 proceedings since the matter wasn't there for trial of those issues."
p2,00:46:55.230,00:47:32.830,spk_1,"The position then went up to the Supreme Court. I understand, I should have mentioned this to my learned friend, that in fact, the petition the Supreme Court has now been dismissed. I'm not quite sure whether the position is now, but it's further down the line. It's simply just make the record correct. What I think is just relevant before I go to the judgment and the award, is just to take you to a few documents in relation to the arbitration which you will find in bundle D [inaudible] in any event, Pakistan proceedings, perhaps, not the easiest to follow."
p2,00:47:32.840,00:47:39.720,spk_0,So we go to bundle D do we?
p2,00:47:39.730,00:48:17.550,spk_1,"The only real relevance of the Pakistan proceedings, is that they, on Justice Aiken's judgment, [inaudible] they were relied upon as showing intention. In our view, they show the contradictory behaviour of Pakistan government in relation to this matter and their desire to extricate themselves from any vestigial remaining allegations that may be made against the Government. Now on -- at D if you go, please to 4 --"

p2,00:48:28.990,00:48:30.620,spk_0,Is this 5th of June 1998?
p2,00:48:30.630,00:51:57.500,spk_1,"It is indeed. And this is from Walter Martin [inaudible] acting for the Government, Your attention is invited to your notice at the 29th of May, in respect of the above matter where our client is required to file its answer to the request for arbitration within 30 days. We wish to bring to your notice that our client has filed legal proceedings in Pakistan, which are pending in the court of Civil Judge First Class Islamabad and are fixed for hearing on the 13th of June 1998. The learner Judge has been pleased to grant an interim injunction pertaining to the dispute. Copy of the court order is attached for your information. And then draw attention to Section 35 of the Arbitration Act, No reference or award shall be rendered invalid by reason only the commencement of legal proceedings on the subject matter of reference, but when legal proceedings on the whole of the subject matter of the reference has been commenced between all parties to the reference, notice there are the arbitrator or umpire, all further proceedings in a pending reference shall, unless estoppel proceedings is granted, under Section 34 be invalid. In this section, the expression, parties to the reference, including any person claiming under any of the parties and litigating under the same title. And the point that, perhaps, is obvious in which the Tribunal made from this is of course, this is the first response to the request. It nowhere says that the respondent is not a party to the Agreement. What it says is we now have an injunction obtained, as it was, without notice from the Government, please do not go on with the arbitration. The next document is the next page, which is the 15th of August. The same lawyers also to the ICC, referring to two further notices, We wish to bring your kind notice that our client has already declined to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Arbitration. It may also be brought into your kind notice that our client does not and shall not submit to the jurisdiction of the ICC. Inter alia the following reasons. There's no contract or arbitration agreement between our parents and Dallah. The contract and arbitration agreement referred to by the claimant were entered into by the claimant, and the Trust. The Trust has already ceased to exist after expiry of the Ordinance. Clause 27 of the contract provides that the Trust may assign or transfer its rights and obligations to the Government without the prior consent in writing of Dallah. The Trust never assigned or transferred its rights and obligations. Contract was entered into and executed in Pakistan and under well established principles of law it's governed by the laws of Pakistan, hence the Arbitration Act is not applicable. Any award passed by the ICC will not be enforceable, being against the public policy and laws of Pakistan. Under Pakistan law, the application of the Protocol on Arbitration Clause's is limited to contracts which are considered as commercial under the law enforced in Pakistan. The contract in question was entered into for religious purposes to provide housing facilities to Pakistan pilgrims. Therefore, the laws of Pakistan don't recognise the protocol and arbitration clause's. Our client never agreed to make a submission to arbitration, and unilateral submission to arbitration by the claimant alone doesn't constitute actual submissions under the laws enforced in Pakistan."
p2,00:51:57.700,00:51:58.020,spk_2,The
p2,00:51:58.030,00:52:19.180,spk_1,"contract provides for leasing of accommodation to the Trust for a period of 99 years, which is not permissible under Saudi law, so the contract is void. The contract was to become fully effective and operative, subject to arranging the finances within 30 days and submission of detailed contracts and specifications. Since none of these conditions was fulfilled by the claimant,"
p2,00:52:19.350,00:52:19.840,spk_2,the
p2,00:52:19.850,00:54:11.360,spk_1,"contract and the arbitration agreement never became effective or operative. Kindly take into account the above factors and reflect the claim as the same is not maintainable. However, this letter shall not in any way and manner deemed to constitute on the part of our client a submission and acquiescence to the proceedings. Nor have we any instructions from our client authorising us to join the proceeding or to represent it in any proceedings. And I think that for present purposes, is as far as I need to take you. And what I would like to do now with Your Lordship's permission is to take you, with that outline of the facts, to the tribunal's reasoning and the judge's reasoning. But before I do so, can I just make a few points. First of all, you will have seen from my learned friend's case that I have, perhaps, been roundly criticised for saying different things at different stages of the proceedings. My Lord, forensically, one often refines and changes one submissions and I hope what I say today will be better and more persuasive than my submissions in the past. Let me make six brief points before I take you to the documents. First, before the tribunal, the parties argued, respectively, for Saudi law and Pakistan. It was the tribunal which decided, as it was entitled to do as a tribunal with a French seat, to apply transnational law. And it ultimately agreed in relation to the main agreement, the arbitration agreement being separable, that the main agreement will be determined according to Saudi law. So, you have, perhaps, a case which is not uncommon, but a little unusual, where the arbitration agreement"
p2,00:54:12.540,00:54:12.850,spk_0,is
p2,00:54:12.850,00:54:44.710,spk_1,"determined by a different law from the main agreement. The second point is that the relevant article under the New York Convention provides, in this case, that the relevant law is the law in the country where the award was made. I conceded, as it appears to be the prevailing view was supported amongst others by Albert Vandenberg in his treaties, that this means that substantive law rather than the conflicts of rules law in France."
p2,00:54:45.640,00:54:48.310,spk_0,"We accept that point, we don't need to go into conflict."
p2,00:54:48.520,00:55:39.940,spk_1,"My Lord, I -- in my submission, that appears to be correct, and I have to raise it because my learned friend says -- makes a strong strong argument to say that the tribunal didn't apply the same test because the tribunal applied transnational as opposed to French law. I therefore, have to make good the point that in our submission, and on the evidence and on the law, transnational law is a part of French law. It is not a foreign law in the sense where you have a choice of laws. It is a law which a French tribunal or French court sitting in France, determining an arbitration clause would apply. And I can make that good if you have before you bundle B and B1 --"
p2,00:55:43.040,00:55:45.080,spk_5,Sorry but I thought you said before it didn't matter?
p2,00:55:48.700,00:56:49.790,spk_1,"My Lord, I say it doesn't matter because my learned friend says it does matter because my learned friend says-- sorry, my bundles just collapsed. My learned friend says that when you are -- one of my arguments before Your Lordships is what we have here, is a tribunal applying the same agreed law to effectively the same facts as the English court is, coming to different conclusions. What my learned friend would say to you is, Oh no, That's not the case, you have a tribunal applying transnational law, that's not the same as French law. I can reserve it for reply. But, in our submission, it's quite clear when one looks at the authorities that transnational law is a part of French law and it's not a wrong one [inaudible] of French law, and that was why I was going to make that good now.

p2,00:57:04.950,00:57:32.550,spk_1,"Well it's because of that, and because of what French law says, because what is said is that because I have agreed that the law by which this again arbitration clause has to be determined is French law, when the tribunal we're looking at it, they were determining the issue or be it the common intention is the same boat, by a different law. And therefore you can't say that they were carrying out the same exercise."

The issue will arise where parties petition for an award to be set aside or enforced, and where it is alleged that either the award was made in the absence of an agreement, on the basis of an arbitration agreement was void or had expired, or the arbitral tribunal declined jurisdiction after wrongly deciding that an arbitration agreement was non existent or invalid. It was in this context that the court held that the existence and effectiveness of the arbitration agreement would only be scrutinised in the light of the requirements of international public policy to use the expression coined by the Paris Court's of Appeals. We've seen that the criticism levelled against these decisions was prompted by the court's use of unfortunate terminology regarding the arbitration agreements own effectiveness and was particularly concerned that the practical and theoretical impossibility of basing the validity of the contract on no law at all. The criticism is unfounded however, in French case law the intention is not to remove the arbitration agreement from all forms of control. It is instead to restrict such control to review of the arbitration agreement in the light of the French conception of fundamental requirements of justice in international commerce, referred to by the French courts as international public policy. Although the goal is not to avoid the application of the law otherwise competent, the expression international public policy is well chosen where the decision to be taken is whether or not a dispute is arbitrable, an issue falling with the scope of --"

The arbitration agreement is not a contract without a governing law but a contract without a choice of law."

p2,01:19:12.720,01:21:24.670,spk_1,"I want to move on to the separate topic in your report, which is paragraph 23. That's the nation of, in a sense, a succession question rather than just a purely consent by conduct question, I want to try and understand a bit further the precise doctrine that you're describing the rule. As far as I understand it, This is a rule that is different from consent by conduct? Or is it really the same rule? No, I think it is the same rule. It's the same rule, Yes. So what is the consent one is looking for applying this rule. It's the same rule. It's not the same moment. It's the same rule. But it's not the same moment. I see. At a certain point you enter in and you perform the contract when you become the party to that contract and to the arbitration clause, does it assume as one of the steps that by conduct you will become a party to the underlying agreement? Yes, you appear to have been a party, exactly as in other cases when the courts say that when a party participated in the negotiation in the performance and so on, that a party appears to be a party to the contract by this behaviour and then it is bound by the arbitration clause, then the arbitrator may decide at the end, for instance, that the contract was null and void. But are you still applying the same test of common intention? Yes. And the same subjective inquiry that we have already spoken about? Yes. So the test you're applying or the question you are asking of the party in question is, Did they subjectively intend to become part of the underlying agreement to become a successor? Yes. Well, did the subjectivity alone, did they want alone to become a party? I don't think this is the test. As they behaved as being a party, the other side considers they were a party, and the fact that behind the head they were not considering the matter is irrelevant. Yes. So it's the same test in all the cases. Is it the same test? Yes. So you still look at the subject of intention of the party that is behaving that way. As Monsieur Vatier said very clearly, I think you find a subjective intention through a number of objective factors. Exactly. So you do that for the party that is behaving as a successor? Yes. Then you do it for the other party as well to find out a common intention? Yes. So that's the evidence on the later --"
p2,01:21:24.910,01:21:38.780,spk_2,"And here we are looking for to answer those questions in relation to the underlying contract. When we have an answer in relation to the underlying contract, then we have the same answer in relation to the arbitration agreements do we, [inaudible] on the facts of this case?"
p2,01:21:39.410,01:21:42.110,spk_1,"My Lord, In practice, though it is right that --"
p2,01:21:42.120,01:21:59.630,spk_2,"I quite understand you can have all kind of theoretical situations where that wouldn't be so. But in this case, you have a question, you have, the issue is one of common intention in relation to the underlying contract. If you win that, then it would follow, You would win the arbitration clause point, if you lost that, it would follow you'd lost the arbitration clause point. Is that correct?"
p2,01:22:00.000,01:22:05.750,spk_1,"In my submission, it would be enough in this case, it may be said against me --"

p2,01:22:11.250,01:22:23.090,spk_2,"So we don't have to worry about that, [inaudible] in your case? Yes. So we're back to the question of what were the common intention, what were the subjective intentions of the parties derived from the objective indicia?"
p2,01:22:23.870,01:23:35.370,spk_1,"And just a few points that are made against me in my learned friends case before I take you to the tribunal's reasoning, the more restrictive approach of the English courts to arbitration whose seat is England, and he refers to certain cases, is in our submission, of course, irrelevant in the context of enforcement. And this is really in the context of transnational law, perhaps I didn't take that any further in the light of our discussion. And finally it said that the tribunal didn't have the benefit of the same evidence and submissions. Well, of course I accept it didn't have the benefit of the advocacy of my learned friend Mr Landau, but the evidence that was before the tribunal was, in fact, with the exception of two matters, identical. One was the witness statement of Mr Natby [inaudible], which was used in the liability hearing, which was produced before Mr Justice Aikens. The other was the judgment in the 1999 proceedings.

p2,01:24:26.660,01:25:25.770,spk_1,"the first was the Saudi law. The second was my concession in relation to the law being substantive law. The third point was our discussion about transnational law. The fourth was the evidence which I have taken you to, the fifth, which I didn't really pursue in the light of what we've been discussing, which was the more restrictive approach of English laws to transnational law because English law doesn't recognise a non-national law for the purposes of an arbitration clause. And the final point was the fact that there wasn't any new evidence. The onus, of course, being on the Government of Pakistan to prove its case. I'm going to take you, if I may, to the award and start at page 26 internally, which is really the paper 414."

p2,01:25:44.360,01:25:46.610,spk_0,So paragraph 6 we were looking at before --
p2,01:25:48.520,01:26:03.660,spk_1,Well I'm just going to start if I might with the paragraph before simply to say that the control exercised by the state over the Trust that comes within that framework an element of evidence of the interest and role of the party and provides the backdrop for understanding the true intentions. Then you have
p2,01:26:03.670,01:26:04.540,spk_0,"at paragraph 6,"
p2,01:26:04.540,01:26:16.510,spk_1,"which we've read, paragraph 7 expands upon that and divides it up into the various periods. And those are the various periods which tribunal dealt with."
p2,01:26:16.520,01:26:20.320,spk_0,"And the words, All stages, pick up the point you were making earlier, I think?"

p2,01:26:23.410,01:26:24.520,spk_1,Deals with all the stages.

p2,01:26:27.080,01:26:27.280,spk_4,"Now,"
p2,01:26:27.280,01:26:30.860,spk_2,we're not here concerned with any concept of agency or anything of that kind are we?
p2,01:26:31.980,01:29:28.290,spk_1,"No, this is common intention. I'm not going to read it all, My Lord, I'm just going to select points because a lot of it already, but just to summarise, I mean 8.1 deals with what happened and the introduction of which you are now familiar. If you go to 8.2, the tribunal makes the point having explained the overlap, and I'm using this as a neutral word because there isn't, we're not running the alter ego argument, but the overlap between what the Ministry of Religious Affairs does and what the Trust does, consequently, the defendant, by signing the MOU, was conducting an activity which falls normally within the functions entrusted to it by the applicable rules. At 8(3), Thereafter it was the defendant by an act of sovereignty, took the decision to establish the Trust on the 14th of February, pursuant to Section 3 of the Ordinance in exercise of powers conferred by Clause 1 of Article 89 of the constitution, which empowers the president to promulgate an ordinance when the national assembly is not in session. Next paragraph, It was the defendant that defined the objects of the Trust and determined the functions that were to be delegated to it, and that included the function of adopting measures for facilitating the performance of Hajj. Then it goes on to deal with the overlap of the functions dealt with by the Government and the Trust, and then 8.4, The organic control of the defendant over the Trust resulting from the Ordinance provisions regarding the composition of the board of the Trust, the Government's prerogatives as to certain functions, though insufficient to lead to the disregard of a separate legal entity of the Trust, as explained above here, constitutes nevertheless an element of evidence as to the true intention of the defendant to run and control directly, and indirectly the activities of the Trust. And this part is not open to me to view the Trust as one of its instruments because I'm not arguing alter ego. He then again goes through the various parts of the Ordinance which we've been through. 8.5, This conclusion is confirmed by the continuous involvement of the Government in the negotiations with the claimant, despite the establishment of the Trust in fact, before the signature of the Agreement and in spite of the recent establishment of the Trust on the 14th of February, all correspondence concerning the finalisation of the pending matters in the project continued to be exchanged with the Government itself, MORA, or Ministry of Finance, and not with the Trust. They then referred to a series of letters, page 30, The conduct of the defendant at the time of the signature -- do we have"
p2,01:29:28.290,01:29:29.600,spk_4,those letters? Are they all in the bundle?
p2,01:29:29.610,01:33:37.730,spk_1,"I believe they all, and I think they're only an example. Yes, right. It is the defendant that decided to delegate to the Trust, the finalisation, signature, and implementation of the Agreement with the claimant, which the defendant and negotiated pursuant the MOU of July 1995, which appeared to be the main purpose for the establishment of the Trust. It said, It was signed by the Minister of Religious affairs, acting as chairman of the board. It refers to the successive promulgations. At 9(2) the defendant was contractually involved in the Agreement as the Government was bound under Article 2 to give its guarantee for the financial facility to be raised. The point I made earlier, that the guarantee was not a guarantee of its performance, but it was the trigger to enable the finance and the whole contract to begin. And at Article 27 of the Agreement, It was authorised to assign its rights and obligations to the Government, i.e. to the defendant, without the prior approval of the claimant. Such a clause is normally used only when the assignee is very closely linked to the assignor or is under its total control through ownership, management, or otherwise. Then the period of performance, During the lifetime of the Agreement, the defendant continued to handle matters relating to the Agreement signed by the Trust and to act to conduct itself in a way that confirmed that it regarded the Agreement as its own. And then it deals with beside the exercise of the regulatory powers, undertake -- officials of the defendant continue to be actively involved in the implementation of the Agreement, as they were previously in negotiation. Refers to the two letters of 26th of September 1996, and 4th of November, that was, those were the two letters I showed you relating to the implementation of rules for the funds which had been set up, and it's right that they had in fact been set up by the Trust. And it then, at 10(2), although the Trust enjoyed, under the Ordinance, legal and financial independence and capacity to own property and assets, and to dispose thereof it does not appear from the actual facts, as submitted by the parties, that the Trust effectively had any funds or assets of its own during its short lifetime, there's no evidence of any schemes or plans made to raise funds and to mobilise pilgrim's savings, nor of any transactions made and implemented by the Trust for the purpose of generating funds to finance its activities. Apparently, it seems as if the only activity conducted by the Trust was the signature of the Agreement with the claimant, with the implementation being followed up by the Ministry of Religious Affairs itself and as if the Trust was not given the human and financial means that could have enabled it to exercise fully its functions as an autonomous legal entity, and has therefore remained as an empty shell with all effective powers being exercised by the defendant itself. It was the Government which decided by a discretionary act or omission not to remit, promulgate the Ordinance, the end of four months from the date of its second re-promulgation, and therefore to put an end to the Trust on the 12th of December 1996 pursuant to the repeal of the Ordinance as a result of its non re-promulgation. The very existence of the Trust appears thus been depending merely on an attitude of non-action by the Government, demonstrating the fragile existence of the Trust, and it's complete dependability upon the Government, even for its own life. And then it refers to the letter of January 1997, and summarises the letter in the first paragraph on page 32. The second paragraph, such letter is very significant because it confirmed, in the clearest way possible, that the defendant, after the elapse of the Trust, regarded the Agreement with the claimant as its own and considered itself as a party to such agreement and, as such, was entitled to exercise all rights and assume more responsibilities provided for under such agreement."
p2,01:33:37.740,01:33:46.500,spk_0,"So he's assuming there that Mr Mufti was writing as secretary of the defendant, isn't he? I mean, that must be, must be so?"
p2,01:33:46.560,01:35:42.240,spk_1,"I think it must be, yes. But he explained why. It's significant also to note in this respect, the defendant's position in these arbitration proceedings, regarding the letter of the 19th of January, did not deal with the substance of contents of such letter, but was rather limited to a formal and very general challenge of the validity of said letter on the ground that such letter was absolutely unauthorised, illegal, and of no effect, because all office bearers of the Trust, including the secretary, had ceased to have any authority to act for the defunct trust, such challenge is, however completely unfounded as the signatory of the letter of the 19th of January 1997, Mr Lutfullah Mufti did not sign such letter in his capacity as official for the Trust, to which, anyway, the letter makes no reference at all, but in his capacity as secretary of the defendant, the Ministry of Religious Affairs, which is an integral part of the Government of Pakistan. As such, the signatory of the letter engages and binds the Government as he has continued to bind it during the whole previous period where the Trust was in existence. In consequence, the signature of the said letter by the secretary of defendant may only be explained and construed as another evidence of confirmation that the defendant considered itself a party to the Agreement, exercising the rights and assuming the responsibilities thereunder. The fact is the more significant because after the elapse of the Trust, the defendant could have remained silent and have abstained from any involvement with regard to the Agreement signed with the claimant on the ground that it was not a party to such agreement and therefore was not concerned by it. But the defendant, on the contrary, took the initiative after the elapse of Trust, and wrote a letter in its name for the claimant, involving itself as a party to the Agreement and treating such Agreement as repudiated [inaudible], such conduct of the defendant clearly confirms that this latter was acting as a contracting party to the Agreement in a quite unequivocal way."
p2,01:35:42.250,01:35:44.630,spk_0,So all of that is built up onto the letter of the 19th of January?
p2,01:35:45.590,01:35:52.740,spk_1,"Yes, in the light of, the fact that, the Ordinance has not been re-promulgated."
p2,01:35:52.740,01:35:58.060,spk_6,Is there any reference in this award to the first set of Pakistani proceedings?
p2,01:35:58.840,01:36:00.790,spk_1,"Yes, we come to them in a minute. But"
p2,01:36:00.790,01:36:02.050,spk_6,not in this context?
p2,01:36:02.420,01:36:06.370,spk_1,Not in the same way as the learned judge referred to --
p2,01:36:06.370,01:36:23.560,spk_6,"Well isn't that important weakness in the tribunal's reasoning, that it doesn't evaluate its conclusion that the signature can only be explained and construed in one way against the relevant background of the same day, what was going on?"
p2,01:36:23.810,01:36:28.040,spk_1,"Well, it evaluates the party's [inaudible] proceeding in a slightly different way."
p2,01:36:28.240,01:36:33.310,spk_6,"Well it deals with the second set, but that favours its conclusion over the page. But I noticed it doesn't, it doesn't deal with the first --"
p2,01:36:34.310,01:36:36.100,spk_1,"My Lord, I accept entirely it doesn't make that point."
p2,01:36:37.530,01:36:37.800,spk_4,but
p2,01:36:37.800,01:36:40.310,spk_6,then we can't put much weight on this.
p2,01:36:41.130,01:36:41.990,spk_1,Well --
p2,01:36:42.060,01:36:49.930,spk_6,"As a process of reasoning, I see what it says, but the fact is that it recites one half of the argument and doesn't put it, the whole"
p2,01:36:49.970,01:36:57.910,spk_1,"picture. Well it depends on what weight there is to be placed on that, on the 1997 proceedings."
p2,01:36:58.260,01:37:01.110,spk_6,"But you've got at least evaluate it, you haven't considered"
p2,01:37:01.120,01:37:01.920,spk_0,the point. And
p2,01:37:01.920,01:37:17.780,spk_6,"possibly because the, this was a one sided process, there was written submissions from the Government of Pakistan, but not oral submissions. And you, naturally, you don't necessarily appreciate all the points which can be made until you've heard bipartite argument."
p2,01:37:18.600,01:37:19.350,spk_4,
p2,01:37:20.250,01:37:27.530,spk_1,"But if, if even they didn't evaluate, it wouldn't have made any difference, then it may not matter. Of course."
p2,01:37:30.520,01:38:01.790,spk_2,"The other thing that strikes me about this, the context of this, is the first part of the analysis very much stresses the, something close to the sort of alter ego. I mean the first part of the analysis is all about how really the Trust is just a shell, all the people in, there wasn't really the Trust personnel who are calling the shots, it was the Government. It's something close to a sham, really, or at least something, it was a creature, if you like, of the Government, whereas that's not part of your case now is it?"
p2,01:38:02.480,01:38:15.040,spk_1,"No, but, of course, when you get, when you look at it in the round, they are looking at, the end letters, as you have seen, is regarded as very significant."
p2,01:38:16.280,01:38:16.700,spk_2,"Well the one we've just been looking at? Yes,"
p2,01:38:17.550,01:38:59.370,spk_1,"the one we've just been looking at, and that, in a sense, the end part in the light of what I've shown you throughout, it would be enough under French law. Can I just finish this, and then perhaps compare what Mr Justice Aikens said? Really, paragraph, yes, Subsequently, after the letter repudiation, the defendant continued to consider itself as a party to the Agreement, instituted proceedings before the Pakistani courts well before the notification of the request for arbitration, claimant. So it does refer, refer indirectly, but I appreciate that Lord Mance says it doesn't tackle that particular issue."
p2,01:38:59.770,01:39:00.570,spk_2,Under
p2,01:39:00.570,01:40:55.820,spk_1,"such judicial proceedings, the defendant in the second set of proceedings, the June 1998 suit, while alleging the Agreement with the plaintiff was no more binding because it's been repudiated, admitted thereby it was a party to such agreement and that it could accept a repudiation of the Agreement by the claimant. And then it deals with the Pakistan proceedings, if I go to 12, And the aforementioned close scrutiny of all the factual elements relating to the conduct of the defendant with regard to the negotiation, signature, implementation, and termination of the agreement as well as with regard to the establishment operation expiry of the Trust, it is clearly established that the Trust established by the defendant was assigned an object, formed part of the functions of the defendant, was organically and operationally under the strict control of defendant, moreover its financial and administrative dependence was largely theoretical because it didn't have any funds or assets of its own. And as all that concern the Agreement with the claimant whether before or after signature, continued to be performed by the defendant concurrently with the Trust. Following the lapse of the Trust, the Trust functions that were originally discharged by the defendant, reverted back logically to this letter with all rights and obligations of the defunct Trust. The Trust, in spite of its distinct [inaudible] personality in theory, appears thus in fact and in conduct to have been considered to have acted as part of the division of the defendant to which it is fully assimilated. The temporary instrument has been created by a political decision of the defendant, the specific activities which the defendant wanted to perform and which was cancelled also by a political decision of the defendant. Therefore, the Trust seems to appear -- now this is the alter ego point -- have been no more than the alter ego of the defendant, which appears in substance as the real party and interest and therefore as the proper party to the agreement and the arbitration with the claimant."
p2,01:40:55.830,01:41:06.970,spk_2,"But unless you're willing to espouse that, then that does rather undermine, at any rate, a significant plank of the reasoning of the tribunal."
p2,01:41:06.980,01:42:01.170,spk_1,"It undermines that part of the plank. But part of this also goes to the other aspect of common intention, if one reads, I've nearly finished, the defendant identified as the Ministry of Religious Affairs has been, in actual fact, the party that was involved -- deals with two grounds really, he deals with the alter ego. Then, he says, the Ministry was involved in the negotiation, implementation, and termination of the Agreement with the claimant from the first day that the housing project was contemplated until after the repudiation of such agreement. This was and remained true before, during, and after the existence of the Trust, with no change being notified in the role of the defendant whether during the lifetime of the Trust or after its elapsed. Such behaviour shows and proves the defendant has always been and considered itself to be a true party to the Agreement with the claimant and therefore to the arbitration agreements."
p2,01:42:01.500,01:42:08.010,spk_2,So they seem to have thought that they were interchangeable so that any obligation of the Trust was an obligation of the Government?
p2,01:42:08.700,01:42:17.840,spk_1,"Well, it would appear, looking at this, that really there were two planks of the reasoning. One was the alter ego. But the other was the common intention test."
p2,01:42:17.850,01:42:25.500,spk_2,"Yes, but they both led to the same conclusion. Namely, that the obligations of the Trust were also the obligations of the"
p2,01:42:25.500,01:42:26.420,spk_1,government.
p2,01:42:27.200,01:42:32.930,spk_0,That was so all the way through. I'm sorry My Lord? That was so all the way through is what they're really saying.
p2,01:42:32.930,01:42:35.840,spk_1,"Yes, certainly meant, but then it goes on to say it's certainly -"
p2,01:42:35.880,01:42:38.020,spk_2,"Including the waiver, for example, of sovereign immunity?"
p2,01:42:39.800,01:42:41.470,spk_1,Well --
p2,01:42:41.480,01:42:48.010,spk_2,"That would be the logic of that anyway. Well -- you don't see very keen to go that far, but --"
p2,01:42:48.600,01:44:03.990,spk_1,"Certainly many of the above mentioned factual elements, if isolated and taken into a fragmented way, may not be construed as sufficiently conclusive. However, Dr Mahmassani believes, when all the factual elements are looked at globally as a whole, such elements constitute a comprehensive set of evidence that may be relied upon to conclude that the defendant is a true party to the Agreement with the claimant and therefore a proper party to the dispute that has arisen with the claimant under the present arbitration proceedings. Whilst joining in this conclusion, Dr Shah, and Lord Mustill, note that they do so with some hesitation, considering the case lies very close to the line. That conclusion finds additional support in the general principle of good faith, that should preside over the implementation of agreements as well as in the general requirements of morality and fairness, that should not be ignored in international transactions. In the view of Dr Mahmassani, these general principles command and require that a state which is a party to agreement for a state owned entity should not be able to avoid it's obligations by having such entity made insolvent or by ending itself the existence of such entity. Such a situation by leaving the other contracting party without any contractual counterpart without any protections to its rights, is unacceptable, unfair, and contrary to all requirements of morality and good faith."
p2,01:44:03.990,01:44:08.840,spk_0,"I'm not sure, I'm not sure you need read the rest of, it's all on the good faith point, isn't it?"
p2,01:44:10.850,01:44:24.710,spk_1,"The rest is, the rest is, My Lord. Let me come to Mr Justice Aikens, and in the interest of time I'm going to concentrate on one or two key points, which is --"
p2,01:44:24.720,01:44:28.800,spk_2,"Sorry, just finally on the good faith point, that was really a minority view was it?"
p2,01:44:30.180,01:44:42.610,spk_1,"I'm sorry. Well it was, basically what was said is"
p2,01:44:42.610,01:44:43.390,spk_0,that a --
p2,01:44:43.400,01:44:47.730,spk_4,It was a minority view which comforted the conclusion the Trust was an alter ego and
p2,01:44:47.730,01:44:48.100,spk_6,therefore a party.
p2,01:44:48.640,01:45:13.420,spk_1,"Except that due to faith applies, not convinced, yes, but nevertheless I'm reassured that it conforms general justice in the case. And then you have Mr Justice Aikens at D, and if you go to the paragraph 105 at page 359."
p2,01:45:16.290,01:45:23.520,spk_4,"So I get, we're back at B are we?"
p2,01:45:23.520,01:45:26.090,spk_1,"No, same same bundle, My Lord. The Core bundle."

p2,01:45:29.420,01:45:31.720,spk_1,359.
p2,01:45:31.730,01:45:34.230,spk_0,Thank you. And paragraph 105?
p2,01:45:35.710,01:45:41.500,spk_5,"It's a very long passage dealing with all of this, Are you going to read"
p2,01:45:41.500,01:45:43.420,spk_1,"out all of this. No, I'm not My Lord."
p2,01:45:43.490,01:45:45.850,spk_5,You set it out quite fully in your case.
p2,01:45:45.860,01:46:43.030,spk_1,"I was just going to point to a couple of points. In particular, I was going to go, at this stage, to paragraph 115, The arbitrators also relied on the fact that the Government took a decision not to re-promulgate the Ordinance, They say that this was an indication of the Government's intention. I find this difficult to follow, it's correct that a new administration took over the GOP on the 6th of November. I would be prepared to infer that the new Government made a positive decision not to re-promulgate, but I do not see why, logically, that leads to any conclusion that the GOP intended to step into the shoes of the Trust, which would cease to exist under Pakistan law, once the Ordinance stood repeal. There's no logical reason why that consequence should flow from the decision not to re-promulgate the Ordinance --"
p2,01:46:43.260,01:46:43.970,spk_5,"That's a succession point, isn't it?"
p2,01:46:45.880,01:47:09.710,spk_1,"Well, it may be, but if it's a wider point, My Lord, I made the point, I think earlier, as to why the Government might well want to dot the i's and cross the t's and ensure that there was no further recourse against them. He then refers to the termination letter. My Lord, keep the key bit is the paragraph 19,"
p2,01:47:10.280,01:47:11.380,spk_4,The
p2,01:47:11.390,01:49:11.300,spk_1,"best evidence, right at the bottom, I have the state of mind of the secretary -- sorry, this is the best evidence referring to Pakistan proceedings, I have the state of mind of the secretary more at the time, it indicates that he, on the part of the GOP, thought that the Trust had rights it could enforce. It does not indicate an intention on the part of the GOP to be bound by the Agreement or the arbitration clause or any intention to step into the shoes of the Trust. My Lord, I've made my submissions on that. We submit that is too simplistic a view of what happened at that particular time. It's easy to read into that without knowing, because there is no evidence, what happened. The argument that it may have been a mistake is without any evidence. And as I said to Your Lordships earlier, it could equally be for tactical reasons. We simply don't know. But what we do know is that Mr Mustafa Lutfi [inaudible] at the time was not a secretary and never had been secretary to the Trust. He was only himself secretary to the minister, he wrote on ministry notepaper. The Trust had never got round to, or never in fact, established any notepaper. If he was writing on behalf of the Government, one might have expected him to say, because that was the only capacity in which I was, he was, writing, this this is -- I'm not writing on behalf of the Government, I am simply writing to make sure that although the Trust has ceased that, in so far as the Trust has any rights, we wish to make it clear that no such rights exist by reason of your repudiation."
p2,01:49:12.080,01:49:14.100,spk_0,He does make the point at paragraph 10.
p2,01:49:14.370,01:49:15.420,spk_1,"Of what, My Lord?"
p2,01:49:15.710,01:49:31.470,spk_0,"I'm looking at the judges 119, and about eight lines into that paragraph, paragraph 10, he said, Refers to the alleged defaults of Dallah, and states that this, quoting repudiation was accordingly accepted by, and, I think in shorthand, the Trust ---"
p2,01:49:33.190,01:49:34.080,spk_1,"I'm sorry, I'm lost, 119?"
p2,01:49:34.120,01:50:02.380,spk_0,"119. It's just that the point being made against you I think is, here is an attempt at analysis, trying to get to the bottom of this, and quite a telling point one might think is what he's able to say about paragraph 10, and the fact that the writer says the repudiation was according accepted by the Trust vide its letter, dated 19th, it's letter dated the 19th of January 1997."
p2,01:50:03.060,01:50:08.970,spk_1,"Yes, but of course you will remember the following year, it said this letter was accepted by the new plaintiff."
p2,01:50:09.360,01:50:22.320,spk_2,"Well, Mr Mufti, if he were there to be cross examined, would be in some difficulties about the --Well he wasn't. I follow that, the contrast between the various different things he was quite willing to swear as being true. But it--"
p2,01:50:22.980,01:50:23.330,spk_1,But a
p2,01:50:23.330,01:50:40.650,spk_2,"might say, The trouble with all this was the Government had decided they didn't want anything to do with this, and they were taking every conceivable way to achieve that end. They were doing this in a rather scattergun approach without anybody giving any real thought to it all. That would be a cynic's approach. I'm not quite sure how that stands with the arguments on either side in this case, but --"
p2,01:50:40.960,01:50:57.030,spk_1,"But if that is a cynic's approach, that means that the Government, as the only party that could possibly at the time be a party, is actually the party that is intending to make sure it no longer has any risk of being a claim made against it."
p2,01:50:57.040,01:51:03.880,spk_0,"That's really partly the good faith point, isn't it? That, if that's the view you take, well good faith would say, you can't you can't accept that type of?"
p2,01:51:04.070,01:51:12.040,spk_1,"The justice point. Yes, I mean, I wouldn't go so far as to alleged bad faith in the sense against the Government, in the sense that we know bad faith."
p2,01:51:12.040,01:51:29.390,spk_2,"But, mind you it's a big step from that to say that they must have intended to be a party. I could see you could have a bad faith point, which might succeed as a bad faith point. But, to my mind, it's a big step to say that if the Government's attitude was something like that, that they must have intended to become a party, one might have thought that's the last thing they'd have intended?"
p2,01:51:29.560,01:51:33.080,spk_1,"Well one might under English law My Lord. But of course, we're looking at French law --"
p2,01:51:33.500,01:51:43.240,spk_2,"Well whoever's law you're thinking about, if you're stepping back and looking at the realities in this kind of situation, which presumably even the French law does, or perhaps particularly does?"
p2,01:51:43.790,01:52:15.270,spk_1,"Well I've showed you the evidence. The fact is, if you behave in a way that indicates, and this was the point that the tribunal took up, if you behave in a way which indicates to objectively, what your subjective intention might be, because why write that letter? It just wasn't necessary, and the only reason to write that letter is to protect what you thought the Government thought were potential recourse or claims against it."
p2,01:52:15.440,01:53:17.580,spk_6,"I'm afraid you're assuming, in my eyes, what you've got to prove in the same way that the tribunal looked at the argument and thought it was the only possible analysis. I don't think what you've assumed is the only possible analysis. The issue we have to grapple with is what makes better sense overall, and better, one interpretation overall is that the first set of proceedings were conducted on the basis that the Trust was party and the letter was written entirely consistently with that, when the judge, your client's instance struck them out on the basis that the Trust had, it was now pointed out that the Trust had ceased to exist, they, the Government, rather unwisely in response to the Paris proceedings, took up the idea that it might be able, might be regarded as a party, and could take a counter proceedings in Pakistan. That's a perfectly, that's the alternative you've got to grapple with."
p2,01:53:17.750,01:53:22.730,spk_1,The problem being that there isn't any specific evidence.
p2,01:53:22.740,01:53:45.270,spk_2,"Well you say, well, the burden of proof is on them. They could perfectly well of produced evidence about all that, they chose not to no doubt as part of a tactical plan or even incompetence. I'm not saying it's a tactical that they didn't product any evidence to this court. Well maybe not, they either chose not to, but whatever the reason, there's no evidence. I mean, that's the sort of line you have to"
p2,01:53:45.270,01:53:48.360,spk_0,take. Well.
p2,01:53:54.240,01:53:55.770,spk_2,"Yes, I've shown you of course the correspondence with ICC. Yes."
p2,01:53:57.130,01:54:00.680,spk_1,"My Lord, I was now going to move on away from the facts to the -- is"
p2,01:54:00.680,01:54:03.490,spk_0,"there any more we want to take out of the judge , or is that it?"
p2,01:54:03.490,01:54:08.320,spk_1,"I don't think so at this stage, I might come back to it when arguing the law, but I don't think there's any"
p2,01:54:08.760,01:54:09.170,spk_0,other
p2,01:54:09.180,01:54:11.730,spk_1,points because the key difference
p2,01:54:12.000,01:54:12.770,spk_2,was
p2,01:54:12.770,01:54:42.820,spk_1,"that termination. I mean the judge, to a certain extent, was prepared to accept more or less what the tribunal has said in relation to the other matters. The key difference. And it is important when you're looking at the legal issues that we will come to now, that the very point Lord Mance has said, We don't really know. And therefore what is an enforcing court to do in such a situation and perhaps I can come to that now --"
p2,01:54:42.820,01:54:47.160,spk_6,"Well suppose, just as a matter of interest, you say that that letter, if the tribunal is right about it,"
p2,01:54:47.540,01:55:04.230,spk_4,"carries you the whole way does it? What, it automatically means that the Government of Pakistan must be regarded as having been party from the outset, or as having become party by voluntarily exceeding in some way, or what?"
p2,01:55:04.390,01:56:09.910,spk_1,"Well I would put it in three different ways. I can say, first of all, that it is effectively the clinching piece of evidence when you look at the whole scene from beginning, the negotiation, the performance, and this is the termination. I can say also, secondly, that it is, has to be looked at in the context not only of the letter but of the termination, of the failure to re-promulgate, which was in itself effectively brought about the termination of the Agreement. So that one is looking at the whole period from December to January. And finally, I can argue that, even if I'm wrong on both those, the letter in itself would be sufficient to entitle my clients to say that the Government became a party by their conduct at a later stage."
p2,01:56:09.910,01:56:16.420,spk_0,"And why, is that for the reasons the tribunal gave, is it? Because he signed a secretary, because of the letterheading?"
p2,01:56:16.650,01:56:25.150,spk_1,"Because of the letter heading, because they didn't need to do it at that stage. And, of course, it's all based on French law."
p2,01:56:32.430,01:57:08.500,spk_4,"Is there any evidence that it was your, I mean, I think you definitely I have about that, is that we're talking about common subjective intention, presumably at the same moment in time, and you're, you've accepted that in January 1997, Dallah thought that Trust continued to exist and so it, there's no evidence that it thought that the Government of Pakistan was party to that agreement at that date. It didn't allege that until 15 months later."
p2,01:57:08.860,01:57:54.110,spk_1,"I'm not sure that's quite accurate, My Lord. On the 26th of January, we haven't got the letter, unfortunately, but it is at least arguable that they wrote back to the Government saying, just because that was all the correspondence was in any event, Don't repudiate, Carry on. We don't know when my clients discovered that the Ordinance had not been re-promulgated, all we do know was at some point in the proceedings, it may be that there's a reference to the last date which may be the last hearing, it may be later on that it was discovered, but it wouldn't necessarily be something that my clients would necessarily know at the time. But it was at any event discovered at some point in the mountain ---"
p2,01:57:54.120,01:57:55.990,spk_6,"Yes, but the mere fact they discovered it doesn't mean to say that they"
p2,01:57:55.990,01:57:59.720,spk_4,thought the Government was party. They may have
p2,01:57:59.720,01:58:03.080,spk_6,"discovered the Trust had existed, racked their brains and"
p2,01:58:03.080,01:58:09.340,spk_4,"then, after a bit, decided that that must mean that the"

p2,01:58:12.790,01:58:15.550,spk_6,got the judges tip in that
p2,01:58:15.550,01:58:18.830,spk_4,"direction in, I think, February 1998."
p2,01:58:18.840,01:58:22.290,spk_1,"But they took the point that the Trust was no longer in existence. Yes,"
p2,01:58:22.300,01:58:27.480,spk_4,"exactly. But that doesn't mean to say they thought the Government was a party, just because they thought the Trust no longer existed."
p2,01:58:28.620,01:58:52.170,spk_1,"Well at that particular point in time, one doesn't know of course what was going on in the proceedings. At that particular point in time, they were trying to defeat an injunction against them brought by the Trust, the issue at that stage may not have been who was a party for the purpose of the arbitration proceedings. All they were seeking to do was to try and stay the proceedings or get themselves out of the"

p2,01:58:57.220,01:59:12.220,spk_0,"Well, you're coming on to deal with the law. I wonder, I mean in view of the time, it doesn't seem very apposite to start that. My Lord what I was proposing --. Now, but I'd just like to see what the general programme is, and if you could help us?"
p2,01:59:13.540,01:59:23.190,spk_1,"Now what I was proposing to do, parts, I think it's three and four of my case, I indicated at the outset was really put in by way of"

I think a large part of that is not controversial, but it was simply to give Your Lordships some background for the purpose of my argument. I would hope, therefore, to be able to canter through that pretty quickly tomorrow morning, and get straight on to the first issue, which is the issue of the extent of the"

p2,02:00:34.370,02:01:15.330,spk_0,"Well, you said that you set yourself a timetable of five hours, which means you've got one hour left. I think there's a certain amount of latitude. But perhaps you can have a word with Mr Landau, and just be quite sure how the time is to be spread between you. I'm afraid we don't sit until 12 o'clock tomorrow.

I would just just like, if I may, just to spend perhaps five or 10 minutes on that and then move straight to the issue just to highlight a few points, because I'm assuming Your Lordships now familiar with the scheme of the New York Convention, as you all know, has a pro enforcement bias. And I draw particular attention to Article three, which is mandatory, which has been incorporated by such in 103, 101 of the 1996 which makes it incumbent upon a contracting state to recognise arbitral awards as binding and enforce them. And the only exception to that is under Article 5 or, not dealing with it today, the public policy issue,"

But you will have noticed that the phrases may be refused rather than may be enforced, and the other point to emphasise, which we did discuss yesterday. But in the context of the enforcement, the onus remains on the government, the objective party and as Your Lordships know, in this country and elsewhere, it's very rare that New York Convention awards or not enforced and this is, I believe, only the second case where this has happened."
p3,00:02:39.060,00:02:51.350,spk_3,"And the rationale of this is the one that we discussed in Dardana v Yukos. Namely, that something that looks like a valid award is to be taken as it unless the country is shown"

p3,00:03:54.510,00:04:14.550,spk_3,"discretion. Well I mean we we explained a a a reason which was consistent with legal principle in Dardana v Yukos you can have subsequent events, and so on which, so to speak, stop or preclude a party."
p3,00:04:14.560,00:04:21.450,spk_2,"Well, that is obviously one of the circumstances. But, My Lord, when I get to that, I will try to seek to persuade Your Lordship that actually,"
p3,00:04:21.489,00:04:22.290,spk_3,it's much broader.
p3,00:04:22.300,00:06:38.650,spk_2,"Principle can be wide. It's not arbitrary, obviously, but it can be wide. But I was going to leave that to the second stage, and I was really just at the moment, laying the groundwork for the first point, which is the review point. The second point, I was just going to make again, just summarising what's in article sections three and four of my case that an award can only be set aside the seat of the arbitration when an award is set aside that in itself provides an independent ground under Article 5 for refusing enforcement and in this case, France being the seat, it can only be set aside in France, the difference being when you're seeking to enforce. And this is an important point when one seeking to enforce an award, it can be enforced in any one of 144 countries, and therefore there is scope for diversity. Unless principles are established, which would undermine the effectiveness of the New York Convention, There are just to make it clear that I accept there is no obligation on a party to go to the seat to have the awards set aside. There are two options, but the options present a choice to that party, and that party may find that if it elects not to go to the seat, the grounds upon which the award can be challenged are more limited. In England, you have Section 67. In other countries, you may have a much wider review of different grounds. It will vary from country to country, but when you come to the enforcement in many situations, though not in all in the model law, the grounds of the same. But in some situations, the grounds under Article 5 will be less. And so that party has to take a decision entirely up to that party, whether it wants to restrict itself to the Article 5 grounds or go earlier to set it aside to make it clear it's not an obligation."
p3,00:06:39.540,00:06:46.370,spk_1,"Is there a different standard, then as between recognition and enforcement, or you you, is it a proposition spreads across the"
p3,00:06:46.370,00:08:05.800,spk_2,"two? Well between setting inside and recognise on the one hand and recognition and enforcement. On the other hand, there may be different standards. It will depend upon the countries. Some countries give a much wider brief to what you can take into account. Section 67 is not really limited in determining whether or not there is jurisdiction. Other countries which have adopted the model law, Section 30, Article 34, 36. Article 34 deals with annulment, 36 is enforcement, have the same principles, so it depends on different situations. But here in France, when you apply to set aside, it's a wide review. But when you come to the enforcement, the enforcement is limited to the Article five grants and other countries. It might be different, so the point the point I'm making is I'm not saying the government had an obligation to go to France. What I am saying is that by not going to France, it elected to choose to take its chance with an enforcing court which may not necessarily be in England. It could have been anywhere in the world of 144. Um mm countries"
p3,00:08:05.810,00:08:43.710,spk_3,"Isn't... isn't there a lurking inconsistency of attitude here? I mean, at certain parts of your case, you stress how transnational and super national arbitration is, and really, the place of the seat of the arbitration is an irrelevance, and it's all subject to transnational considerations. And yet, you say as soon as you go transnationally, you find that the seat becomes rather important and that you're worse off when you seek to resist enforcement than you would be in the place of the seat."
p3,00:08:43.719,00:09:38.930,spk_2,"Well not necessarily. In some cases you like, that's all. I mean, it will depend upon what the law of the sea it is, but the point being that the I'm not saying that one has primacy, although some of the American courts described one as primary primary and the other secondary. But if you go to the court of the seat. You have the and you succeed the great advantages. It gives you a second bite at the cherry, so to speak, when you're seeking to enforce, because it gives you an additional ground. So that if, for example, in this case the government had gone to France and had the award set aside and we had sought to enforce, they would then have been able to say, Not only is it not valid, but also it's been set aside at the seat. That's really as far as I need to take it for today's purposes. But"
p3,00:09:38.930,00:09:59.560,spk_3,"that, I mean, as you say, that contemplates the possibility of it being set aside on grounds which actually have nothing to do with jurisdiction on the merits, for example, and one can well understand, Uh, the specific provisions in the New York Convention is catering for that sort of situation. We have appeals in arbitration cases in this country."
p3,00:10:00.390,00:10:01.390,spk_2,Well My Lord...
p3,00:10:01.390,00:10:17.660,spk_3,"If award has been set aside, then obviously that's a pretty fundamental defect. But one would have thought that it would be strange to have distinctions between different countries as to the approach when the issue is a different one namely, whether there's an arbitration agreement at all effectively."
p3,00:10:17.840,00:10:50.630,spk_2,"Well, with respect. I don't spend too long on this. But if you take the English situation Section 67 it's set aside. If one had a reverse situation, if it was set aside in England under Section 67 and we were seeking to, if it was an English seat we were seeking to enforce in France. Also, the government was seeking to Pakistan was seeking to enforce in France. It would then be able to say that the English courts have set it aside, and that's an extra ground. The English courts under Section 67 do a complete re hearing, and it is circumstance."
p3,00:10:52.470,00:11:05.250,spk_3,"that was my point. That's why you've got this specific provision to cater for that sort of situation, to to deploy it as a reason for limiting jurisdictional review. Seems to me not to follow."
p3,00:11:05.260,00:11:53.980,spk_2,"I don't think with respect, I will say I was actually saying the reverse. I wasn't saying it was limit jurisdictional review. First of all, Section 67 is not a merits point. What I was simply saying, in effect, was to make it clear, we're not saying that there is a limit by failing to go to the court of the seat. All I'm saying is that there may be a practical consequence in some circumstances. I don't put it any harder. I'm not saying that you are obliged to go and therefore because you don't you're limited. All I'm saying is you don't go and you may lose a ground under Article 5, but what this court is concerned with is what happens here when the award is before it for the purpose of enforcement."
p3,00:11:54.480,00:12:21.280,spk_1,"Presumably the whole convention recognised the reality of the situation that somebody who is successful holds an award. We want to enforce it as soon as possible and we'll go to the jurisdiction which offers the best prospect of a full recovery. And that's presumably why we're here. And therefore it seems silly to force people as it were, to argue in the seat of where the award was made. If you can do with the same issue validity of the"
p3,00:12:21.280,00:12:44.370,spk_2,"agreement here. Well I agree with you that effectively because I think that because my learned friends case perhaps latched onto it a different way, I was really trying to make that point. I think the only other point to make on enforcement is. Of course, it's not necessarily that you could choose one country, but I mean, if there are assets spread all over, it could be seeking to enforce simultaneously or one after the other in several countries, depending on the size of the award and where the"
p3,00:12:44.600,00:12:46.850,spk_1,"spread. Anyway, as you say, we shouldn't waste too much."
p3,00:12:46.860,00:14:49.960,spk_2,"I just really wanted to dispel what I think has become a point, which in a sense is not really critical to the submissions I make. I'm not taking you to the model law or the English or the French position as set out in the case just before finally, just want to make a few brief comments on the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdictions. Let me make it clear that we accept that the tribunal is not the final arbiter of its own jurisdiction. It is subject to review being described as by Gaillard Chronological review, and it can happen at various stages. It could happen by way of a preliminary ruling under Article 16(3) of the model law or Section 32 in this country. It can happen by way of setting aside, and it can happen at the enforcement stage. But there is an important, vital distinction to be made between the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction, which is the jurisdiction to determine whether or not that tribunal has substantive jurisdiction. In other words, to go on here in the merits and the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction itself, uh huh. And the conclusion of an exercise of a kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction may be right, or it may be wrong. But that tribunal, pursuant to that kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction still in our submission has jurisdiction to make the wrong decision. I may be wrong, and it can be set aside or it can not be enforced. But it doesn't undermine the initial entitlement of the arbitrators to make that decision. And that decision again, even if right or wrong remains binding, it may not be enforced because it's wrong, but as a partial award in this case, it is a binding award because the convention recognises, as does the English statute, partial awards."
p3,00:14:50.290,00:14:54.390,spk_1,"And how do you fit this into your argument in this case, I mean how does this follow the point you make?"
p3,00:14:54.390,00:16:08.120,spk_2,"Well it's background to the context when I'm coming to the review, which I will explain in a moment. But I just want to make this point because what is said, particularly we've come to discretion, is that the competence, competence jurisdiction is based on consent. What we submit is based on consent is the entitlement of the arbitrators to go on to hear the decision. If they decide that they haven't got jurisdiction, they cannot go on to hear the substantive merits. If they decide they have got jurisdiction but are wrong in that result, they still can't go on to hear it. But they still have the initial entitlement to make that decision. And that initial entitlement is not dependent on the consent of the parties because it's a functional necessity of the scheme of international arbitration, which otherwise would grind to a halt if every time there was an issue as to whether an arbitrator appointed pursuant to apparently valid agreement was, or was always not entitled to make that described it this way, provisional determination."
p3,00:16:08.130,00:16:25.010,spk_3,Have you got any authority for the proposition that award as to jurisdiction falls within the New York Convention because if it does seem to be some radical radical consequences.

p3,00:18:10.140,00:18:10.460,spk_2,"Yeah,"
p3,00:18:11.540,00:18:13.210,spk_0,yeah.
p3,00:18:13.210,00:18:35.840,spk_2,"The kompetenz-kompetenz principle was now recognised by the most international conventions on arbitration by most modern arbitration statutes by the majority of institutional arbitration leaders, as the 1958 Convention only deals with the conditions for recognition, it doesn't cover the kompetenz-kompetenz principle."
p3,00:18:36.100,00:18:36.600,spk_4,Well isn't that against
p3,00:18:36.800,00:18:38.050,spk_3,your submission?
p3,00:18:38.860,00:18:52.460,spk_2,"No with respect, because one has to look at how arbitration works in practise, and it is it is enshrined in most statutes is enshrined in our statutes. Uh, that the arbitrator"
p3,00:18:52.490,00:20:06.330,spk_3,"Yes. I mean, I don't understand the difficulty, really. It seems obvious that if someone is appointed to decide almost anything that person or body can consider whether they are properly appointed and have jurisdiction to decide whatever is there are some decide to elevate that further seems perhaps unnecessary. But perhaps the more important point is this doesn't seem to support the proposition that a partial award on jurisdiction is an award subject to the New York Convention. And if it were, I mean, why wouldn't it be bounding? Because your argument, kompetenz-kompetenz delivers to the arbitrators under some international generally accepted international principles jurisdiction to decide their jurisdiction. If, say, there's nothing in Article five, which would enable the government of Pakistan or anyone to apply to resist enforcement of that award or recognition of it, and we will be bound to recognise the arbitrator's decision then.  Would we? Isn't that the consequence?"
p3,00:20:07.500,00:20:12.510,spk_2,"What we say is it is a binding decision, but you can choose not to enforce"
p3,00:20:12.510,00:20:34.180,spk_3,it. Well why? Under which head? If it's if they've got jurisdiction to decide their jurisdiction under some general international principle or you mentioned under particular statute. I think Gaillard says the general international principles to be found in the laws of all countries liable to recognise awards.
p3,00:20:35.100,00:20:37.280,spk_2,"And there's also a section, yes,"
p3,00:20:37.280,00:20:46.700,spk_3,"but which is that which, under which head in Article 5, would the government of Pakistan be able to resist the proposition? But this is a binding decision on jurisdiction"
p3,00:20:48.010,00:20:48.830,spk_2,Article 5. Point 1(a)
p3,00:20:50.900,00:20:54.510,spk_3,Well that undermines your argument because you...
p3,00:20:54.520,00:21:46.360,spk_2,"You wouldn't say it's not binding. This is this is the point my Lord. There's a distinction between binding in Article three and enforceability because even if this court fails to enforce the award, the award exists and can be enforced in another jurisdiction. The role of enforcing court is not, however, egregious the what's gone wrong. It has not got the power to set aside the award. All I can say is we in this country will not enforce it, whether it's public policy or whether it's Article 5. But the award still exists as an international instrument, and I know that in a sense, it's difficult to comprehend. One was looking at in a national context, but in an international context, that is the position. But"
p3,00:21:46.360,00:22:28.280,spk_3,"the only basis under Article 5, which treats recognition and enforcement in the same breath on which the government of Pakistan will be able to say, sorry the arbitrators were wrong on jurisdiction is if the agreement is not valid and that must be the agreement under which the arbitrators are ruling on the jurisdiction, is not valid. So how can their ruling have any validity at all? Certainly, how can it be? I simply don't understand where the argument, how it runs or where it goes, actually,"
p3,00:22:28.290,00:22:37.720,spk_2,Well because for the very point that I'm seeking to make the source of the jurisdiction is not the agreement.
p3,00:22:38.740,00:22:38.970,spk_3,I see. The
p3,00:22:38.970,00:22:40.800,spk_2,source of the jurisdiction
p3,00:22:40.810,00:22:41.840,spk_3,is
p3,00:22:41.850,00:22:52.340,spk_2,"in the is in the statute. For example, in England, it's Section 30. The English courts give the tribunal the power to determine their range jurisdiction."
p3,00:22:52.540,00:23:03.340,spk_1,It seems to be some kind of underlying principle that that's the way to express in the reference you've given us. Whereas the convention is concerned with enforcement --
p3,00:23:03.820,00:23:05.050,spk_2,The convention is concerned with enforcement and

p3,00:23:09.480,00:23:14.250,spk_1,"Yes, well, this is why I asked you earlier. Actually, how this all fits into the argument because actually I I can't see..."
p3,00:23:15.920,00:23:23.460,spk_2,"It becomes relevant when we're looking at, really when we come, we're coming to discretion."
p3,00:23:25.230,00:23:30.290,spk_5,One final point isn't isn't this notion linked to the seperability of the arbitration clause?
p3,00:23:30.450,00:24:00.550,spk_2,"Well, there's debate about that. Yes, in one sense it is, although the commentators perhaps not all ad idem about that. But that is right. It is. It is separable, Section 7. But the point is that one has Article 3 and Article 3 and says that it is binding. And of course, one cannot get over there, because what Article 5 doesn't say that it ceases to be binding. All Article 5 says it ceases to be enforced."
p3,00:24:01.540,00:24:04.270,spk_4,"Yeah, that the agreement is not valid."
p3,00:24:04.740,00:24:07.050,spk_0,"Yes,"
p3,00:24:07.440,00:24:10.950,spk_4,"But how can you have something that's binding, which is not valid?"
p3,00:24:11.440,00:24:54.000,spk_2,"Because it is a view of the enforcing court as to the validity of the underlying agreement. But it will not stop a party going to another country just because the English court says it's not valid, still entitles a party to go and enforce it elsewhere. Because the binding the binding was one of the compromises that came out in one of the progressions that came out of the New York Convention from the previous Geneva Convention, where they sought to avoid issues about the finality and the compromise was the word binding."
p3,00:24:54.070,00:24:55.460,spk_4,I don't see what this is really
p3,00:24:55.460,00:24:56.720,spk_0,going to do with
p3,00:24:57.240,00:25:08.780,spk_2,"it because it really background and I can take it, come back to it as necessary. I'd really like now if I may, to move to the review point, which is part five and"
p3,00:25:08.790,00:25:09.890,spk_0,So
p3,00:25:09.900,00:25:11.140,spk_1,whereabouts in your case
p3,00:25:11.140,00:25:51.850,spk_2,"now... That is... sorry I've renumbered it. It's part five of my case which is paragraph123. I'm going to leave the case a little and make the points more succinctly. I'd hope. As Your Lordships would have seen roundly criticised not only in the court today, but by my learned friend for not being able to formulate some rigid principle as to what is the nature of the review. But I hope we'll be able to show that a flexible and nuanced approach enables justice to be achieved more readily and some unyielding statement as to how the court should approach the issue."
p3,00:25:51.860,00:25:53.070,spk_0,Because
p3,00:25:53.080,00:26:40.850,spk_2,"any consideration of the nature and extent of an enforcing court review, which is carried out according to its national procedures, must be able to accommodate a variety of potential situations which could come before it. Now in this case, we have a unanimous world from an experienced and eminent tribunal sitting in Paris under the auspices of the ICC producing a fully reasoned awards scrutinised by the ICC under its Rules seat in a sophisticated country was a sophisticated jurisprudence where the respondent declined to participate at the oral hearings. Even without prejudice, it was perfectly entitled to do. But the tribunal nonetheless produced lengthy, and nonetheless their submissions were considered by the tribunal."
p3,00:26:40.860,00:26:42.770,spk_3,I'm not...

p3,00:26:45.040,00:27:42.420,spk_3,"Issue has been taken with the brief reference, which is more extensive in your case to the distinction of the tribunal. And personally, I feel that some, uh, some force in the way in which issue is taken are we really to give credence to award by reference to some assessments of the distinction age, merits of the arbitrators strikes me as and courts do, I'm afraid occasionally, say, a very well known this or very distinguished judge, but usually of people who are dead. And it does seem to me that's actually slightly ageist. In a way, you may have a brilliant 25 year old whose infinitely more on the ball than someone as old as I am."
p3,00:27:42.920,00:27:57.280,spk_2,"I'll take your point Lord Mance. I take comfort from the fact that it doesn't originate from me. But when we looked at Canadian cases, which I've cited the expertise of the the arbitrators has been a fact that has been taken into account. I say no more than that."
p3,00:27:57.610,00:28:03.380,spk_1,"It is individualised in Canada, they're picking out particular people say, Oh yes, A, B and C are"
p3,00:28:03.790,00:29:00.850,spk_2,"I suppose in the sense that they look at the tribunal in the particular case, yes, but my lord, you must make that It's not the prime point in my case. What I do make of it will say, is that when I come to it is that it indicates that different people in this particular case on the same facts can legitimately come to different reasons, and I'll come to that in a moment. The other end of the scale. Of course, you may have the single arbitrator who let's leave aside his eminence but nonetheless writes the ill reason and incomprehensible award. All I'm saying here is that there is a pool of potential situations when one is talking about 144 countries that can arise. Moreover, of course, there's no system of precedent in international arbitration. In each case is determined on its"
p3,00:29:00.850,00:29:06.540,spk_5,own facts. You said that they were unanimous. But of course it's rather more nuanced than that isn't it?
p3,00:29:06.560,00:30:42.250,spk_2,"Well, except this Lord Collins, is that if you have doubts and if to have doubts, as opposed to one having doubts, one has to assume that a lot more thought has gone into it before You actually agree to put your name to it. I mean sometimes happens that one has doubts. But here it would appear that, too had doubts. And yet nonetheless, they concluded that I think the phrase was conformed with the justice of the case, so one can argue it both ways. The government contend at paragraph 233 of their case that the enforcing court has to determine the issue of consent for itself, the owners being on the objecting party and it continues in making this determination. The court may have regard to the reasoning and findings of the alleged arbitral tribunal if they are helpful but is neither bow nor restricted by them. Now while it appears therefore to be accepted that the reviewing court can look at the award, one might ask rhetorically helpful to whom. This test ignores the fact that what we are looking at here is not a challenge to the award. For instance, under Section 67 it's not an appeal, but it's a determination of whether a binding award can be enforced in England under the court's discretion on the ground that it wasn't a valid ground. So in our submission, the test helpful is unhelpful because the award exists as a piece of evidence. The question is not whether it's"
p3,00:30:42.250,00:30:43.480,spk_0,helpful but
p3,00:30:43.480,00:31:13.760,spk_2,"in our submission what weight should be given to it and what deference should be paid to its reasoning. Because, as I said a moment ago, and this is why I went through it, it is a binding international instrument with an independent life, irrespective of whether or not one country chooses to enforce it. And so if one has a rehearing of necessity, if you have a rehearing, you start from scratch and you ignore the award other than by way of reference, because you start with a blank canvas."

Yes, I don't think the only thing that's new, of course, is I have to deal with the phrase helpful because I didn't have my learned friend's case. I've adjusted it, and I've tried to make it shorter. It's set out at more length but I'm trying to keep the point shorter. I don't believe there's anything inconsistent. It may just be expressed slightly differently. But the fallacy of the government's argument, in our submission, is that it reflects what would happen in the English court when looking at a case on appeal. And that's inconsistent with the proenforcement policy of the convention. Can I"
p3,00:32:07.160,00:32:14.600,spk_3,just take issue with one point you made several times you say this is a binding award?
p3,00:32:16.440,00:32:18.920,spk_0,Yeah. If
p3,00:32:18.920,00:33:29.560,spk_3,"there is no agreement, then the only logical consequence, although an enforcing court, can't declare it of a decision by an enforcing court not to enforce on the ground that there's no agreement, is that there is no binding arbitral award and actually that will normally give rise to an issue estoppel in every other enforcing court. If common law principles apply that or Article 3 isn't saying that invalid documents are binding arbitral awards. What is his enunciating is a general principle that arbitral awards are binding if they are made, of course, subject to a valid arbitration agreement. And all that we said in Dardana v Yukos was that the onus is on the person resisting enforcement to prove that something which is apparently a valid and binding arbitration award is not because there was no binding agreement and the"

An Article 5 then throws the onus on the party resisting, but I don't think you can interpret. Article 3 is conferring, making binding something which is actually, um, logically a nullity once you've established the matters in Article 5(1)(a)"
p3,00:34:00.110,00:34:16.000,spk_2,"If I may just digress for a second. Your Lordship's point about apparently conforming documents, of course, applies not just to the award or to the agreement but you have to lodge both that is the sort of mechanism that starts the ball rolling."
p3,00:34:16.860,00:34:29.530,spk_3,"But none of them are actually binding. It's simply that the onus of proving they're not binding is on the person resisting enforcement. At least once. You've got to a certain point of something that looks like, on the face, of it valid."
p3,00:34:29.530,00:34:46.560,spk_2,"My Lord, I can see the logic of that. But the other side of the logic is that if that is right, why would this award not be binding? Why could a party not go and seek, uh, in another country to enforce the award?"
p3,00:34:47.260,00:34:48.190,spk_0,What
p3,00:34:48.190,00:34:55.139,spk_2,"is wrong? If Your Lordship is right and this country set aside the award as invalid,"
p3,00:34:55.440,00:35:21.710,spk_3,"No it wouldn't. This country would simply refuse to recognise it. It would say there wasn't an agreement. This is just as good as a newspaper article. It's not an award. Other countries might allow the same issue to be relitigated if they didn't have a doctrine of issue estoppel. But assuming they did, and I think many countries do, they would say, sorry, it's been decided in England."
p3,00:35:21.720,00:35:59.530,spk_2,"Yes, but I think I think with respect, maybe we're across purposes. What? I'm not saying that this court can't say when it is seeking to enforce. The agreement is not valid. I accept that because that's the ground upon which my learned friend has to establish. But what I'm saying is that as an instrument, the award in practise it's not enforced here, and that's all that matters for the courts. But in practise that award, even though the English courts have said the agreement is not binding, that award as an award remains. And one can see that in other examples"

Article 7 provides a favoured right provisions you may have seen in the Court of Appeal decision. Lord Justice Rix in particular, deals with this, and there are cases I think my learned friends are going to show you. But there are cases such as Hill Martin and promptly, where an award has actually been annulled in the seat. And yet countries have enforced it. So the point being that the status of the award"

Of course, it can be set aside just as any award can be set aside in any country internationally prima facie. Under Article 3, any award is binding, but it is and enforceable and recognisable in other countries subject to the New York Convention. But it says, under the conditions laid down in the following article, so you can't separate the binding character of the award from the grounds for non enforcement of non-recognition."
p3,00:37:39.540,00:38:41.690,spk_2,"Well My Lord, the point we make is not that the English courts can only have a limited role in this country, they cannot determine what other countries will do because that awards still exists. I give you an example example of Article 7, which entitles, even if even if set aside, it entitles a country to enforce an award. And setting aside an award is stronger than not enforcing it, My Lord. That, in a nutshell, is our submission that the the role of the enforcing court is to make a decision on the enforceability, which is a different decision from the making a decision as to the underlying nature of, uh, the award. Um the"

p3,00:39:11.130,00:39:39.790,spk_4,"But all that's really irrelevant. There's only one question for the court in this class of case. Was the agreement valid? That's the question. The only question the courts addressing it doesn't really matter whether the awards value how you categorise the award at all. There's one question. Was the award valid? Was the agreement valid? And on that question, it's common ground that the burden of proof on this case the government indeed, that's all there is to it. That's the question of things to get on, decided on the facts."

It's not binding by virtue of the fact that there isn't a valid agreement. The starting point for an English court is not to say I'm English court. I'm going to look at all the facts again effectively. If it's helpful, I'll look at the award as is set against me. It has to look at the award and give such weight in the circumstances to that award. In the context of, as Lord Clarke, says the onus being on the government to prove to the"

My learned friend comes along and says, but the names wrong. I have the certificate here from the company's house registry saying clearly this is wrong. Then clearly the English courts would give very little attention to the award. But where you have here, a case where there is no new evidence brought by the government on what we say is a result which was not a result which a tribunal could not have come to on the facts. You must give weight to that award where you have a fully reasoned award."
p3,00:42:15.750,00:42:35.460,spk_4,"Do you say that you say that the principles of those that are applied by the Court of Appeal to the question, whether a judgment is on the facts, take any case, there's a judgment of the facts.

Then, of course, the English court would have to not enforce it. But there are"
p3,00:43:47.100,00:43:47.680,spk_0,And that is more

p3,00:43:48.660,00:44:40.640,spk_1,"test. Where you put it in Paragraph 135 of your case is that it's got some inherent evidential value. That's really what I think the argument comes to you say. But what does it add on? [overlapping voices] I mean, I'm sorry I shouldn't have interrupted. It's the evidence of what the arbitral tribunal thought and what it made of the evidence it had before it itself. You say, I'm simply trying to focus your argument by reference to the writing in the case is that it has evidential value and therefore because it's part of the evidentiary matrix you don't start de novo and therefore the test that the judge set for himself, which will cut in 134, is wrong because he goes back to the very beginning and he finds his starting point in terms of the statute, which doesn't talk in terms of review at all, it just simply puts a question in effect."
p3,00:44:40.650,00:47:01.410,spk_2,"I accept and that is why there is an issue to be determined by this court, because it's an issue that hasn't actually been resolved certainly at this level as to whether, unlike the Section 67 which is accepted as a rehearing, what is the standard of review that and enforcing court as opposed to a setting aside, court should adopt when looking at an international prevention award. If I can just have another stab, there are various ways you could put it. But another formulation is that the review relates to whether or not the government has proved that the government has to prove a negative, that it didn't consent to arbitration and whether in the exercise of the discretion, the court should refuse to enforce the award. Where we part company with the formulation of the government is that in considering this issue, the court must, not may, consider the award and its reasoning and findings and must give such weight is appropriate in the circumstances of the case in hand to that award as a piece of evidence, together with the other evidential mix and the other factors in the case. And it cannot be a just as in an appeal. It cannot be an absolutely rigid situation because you will have a variety of different types of situations that will arise. There will be cases where there is a compelling new evidence to give you example in a completely different context. The case of [can't figure out case name], which is a procedural issue. Uh, the tribunal went ahead and heard a case where new points were made at the hearing, whether the responded unfortunately, severely ill and didn't have an opportunity to present his case. And it was late in the in the enforcement hearing that it became apparent that he had not had this opportunity and that new points have been put at the hearing. And in that case, it was the only case where the New York Convention had not been set aside. The gentleman had cancer and had been ill for over a year. Lord Phillips. I think that was, the judge said, that there would be severe injustice, and clearly this was a case where there was new evidence which indicated a completely different state of affairs."

In the circumstances he will say, Well, you can't really give it any weight at all because it has these mistakes and therefore it's proper to start again and look at the matter fresh.

One side, maybe help with the other side helpful is not"
p3,00:47:53.370,00:48:07.700,spk_1,"well, he is considered. Look at Appendix A, he looks at it and analyse it and says, well, there are these errors and perhaps he doesn't need all of them. But he says, given those really, the sensible thing is to have a fresh look at it."
p3,00:48:08.070,00:48:34.100,spk_2,"Well, yes, but that's not a helpful test that's a weight test, the weight test in this case. And the point in this case is that what you have is a case of an interpretation of facts. The basic facts are not really in dispute. It's the interpretation of the facts, according to principles of law which are not really in dispute because the French law is agreed."
p3,00:48:34.230,00:48:51.830,spk_3,"Yes, but there is a problem, which is a more detailed problem, perhaps a second year problem that actually seeking to uphold the arbitrator's evaluation of the facts are you. They decided the case on the basis of alter ego, which are not pursuing"
p3,00:48:51.840,00:50:06.270,spk_2,"with respect, My Lord, not by any means exclusively. Your Lordship will have seen that they went through it. First of all, the test in paragraph 6 of the partial award was a test I put to their French witness, and he agreed that that was generally the correct test, and they then expanded upon that in paragraph 7 and said, You look at it at the four stages. And they did examine it at the four stages. Yes, of course, they did deal with the alter ego, but it is sustainable, even if you ignore that, because it's consistent in our submission with the facts of this case, and just to make this, there is a practical reason as well. In enforcement, the result of having a complete rehearing from scratch, of course, can mean that enforcement of an award, which is supposed to be a simple procedure, can take several days now. In our case, I think it was three days. I may be wrong, but in Svenska it was 4 to 5 days with the English court effectively rehears everything from scratch again."
p3,00:50:06.330,00:50:28.890,spk_3,"How is your flexible and nuanced approach going to alter that we're going to be asking, Well, how flexible and how nuanced in the light of the 11 points, which are made in Annex A, and or one, or the points made in Annex two and so on, it seems to me, is really going to be no difference. It's chalk and cheese."
p3,00:50:29.660,00:50:49.200,spk_2,"Well, they may all one can say, but the point also is emphasised, and I set it out in the case. Although it was early days, it was the government's views in the traveux, which I've set out in the case, and just to give you the reference in the case."

The 2nd and 3rd sentences because one has to appreciate that the grounds on which you would want to refuse enforcement, uh, could vary. I mean, there are people who disagree with the award on its substance. Now we're not dealing with that kind of issue here, but one can quite see that there's a very strong resistance against opening up awards on their merits and one knows that's absolutely fundamental to an understanding of the way the Convention works. On the other hand, if you've got something which is safeguarding as it puts the basic rights of people, then nothing could be more basic. Can it, than the fact that you're being faced with an award based on an alleged agreement to which you weren't a party and why shouldn't one look at that and give it a thorough examination to see whether or not this really was an agreement to which the individual or the party was really a party."

And therefore we would submit that you have to look at the award and give considerable weight to that award in looking at that fact. And if I can just, I've got five minutes. If I could just before almost concluding this point, just take you because I've mentioned it but didn't take you to yesterday, just a couple of other documents just to indicate to you and to bring home the point that this is in some ways an unusual case because there is no new evidence and it's a question of different lawyers because they're lawyers, at the end of the day, the arbitrator's, interpreting the same facts in different ways and trying to put in trying to interpret an objective behaviour subjectively.

Thus, Trust established under the ordinance ceased to exist with effect 12th December 1996 and all of its office bearers, including the secretary of the Board of Trust I, secretary of Ministry of Religious Affairs, also ceased to have any authority to act for and on behalf of the Trust. The letter, dated the 19th of January 1997 written by the Secretary Ministry of Religious Affairs and addressed to the claimant, was therefore absolutely unauthorised, illegal and of no effect."
p3,00:58:06.460,00:58:07.480,spk_0,So this is written on

p3,00:58:35.240,00:58:42.750,spk_5,It's plainly what it said its letter purportedly written on behalf of the Trust. It certainly doesn't say it was written on behalf of the government.

Well -- I suppose you could declare its validity, but then wouldn't need to do that would you?"
p4,00:06:06.730,00:06:32.220,spk_1,"Well, it depends in what context it means has not yet become binding. It may be that it had been declared, but perhaps, I mean I'm thinking aloud, but hadn't been scrutinised by the ICC or something like that.

The convention is quite firm, It says, you shall do that. And when it deals with procedural matters, article 4 for example, you shall supply, You shall do this and that. But it's, every time you come up against enforcement or recognition, The word, may, is used. And that could be said, as perhaps, I'm making Lord Mance's point, that there are various defences that might come in, estoppel is probably the prime example where the court would feel It's not proper to do what it's allowed to do. So, it's giving a power to the court, and it's probably recognising the courts prefer to exercise a power rather than be told what to do, directed what to do by convention."

So there is a presumption in favour of recognition and enforcement. It's not a presumption against it. It doesn't say, You may be entitled to recognition, it says, Recognition and enforcement may be refused.

And to give you -- how would it be bad faith? I'm not saying I'm alleging it, the reason I raised that is because I was just going to take you to one authority to which I refer. Maybe we can, probably deal with it from the extract, which is the case of Hebe, which is a case where"

If you would like to look at it in a bundle of authorities, as it's the only authority I'm probably going to refer to, its volume 2, page 61, it might just be easier. This was a case about on the grounds of public policy where there was an issue, it wasn't really a public policy issue because the issue was whether or not the Tribunal"
p4,00:14:51.820,00:14:52.490,spk_0,had acted
p4,00:14:52.490,00:14:59.960,spk_1,"properly in relation to seeing some experts, and it was dressed up as a public"

p4,00:15:01.140,00:15:06.260,spk_1,But it's the general comments
p4,00:15:06.260,00:15:07.060,spk_0,that
p4,00:15:07.070,00:15:08.010,spk_1,"are made, and,"
p4,00:15:08.020,00:15:20.190,spk_0,
p4,00:15:20.190,00:15:21.410,spk_1,"I think if one starts,"
p4,00:15:21.420,00:15:30.920,spk_0,[pause]
p4,00:15:30.920,00:15:50.630,spk_1,"I mean, a passage that I quoted earlier in my submission bottom of page 35, The convention in providing that enforcement of the award maybe resisted on certain specified grounds, recognises that though an award may be valid by the place where it is made, this is the context of public policy --"
p4,00:15:50.730,00:15:51.080,spk_5,"So sorry, which page are you on?"
p4,00:15:51.550,00:15:54.180,spk_1,"I'm just reading, just put it in context."
p4,00:15:54.410,00:15:55.240,spk_4,The page you are looking for the quotation is page 39 --
p4,00:15:56.570,00:16:26.260,spk_1,"The bottom of page 35. The last word of the convention starts top page 36, and this is context of public policy, Although an award may be valid by the law of the place where it's made, its making may be attended by such a great departure from basic concepts of justice as is applied by the Court of Enforcement that the award should not be enforced. Then the relevant passage is really at page 39."
p4,00:16:26.740,00:16:28.750,spk_0,The approach
p4,00:16:28.750,00:16:36.700,spk_1,"was adopted, this was by Catherine Jane China [inaudible] oil case, concerning the constitution of the SeaTac tribunal,"
p4,00:16:36.710,00:16:38.460,spk_0,His
p4,00:16:38.460,00:17:12.699,spk_1,"Lordship held that the ordinance and the convention conferred a residual discretion on the court of enforcement to decline to refuse enforcement, even if a ground for refusal might otherwise be made out. I agree with His Lordship that the use of the word, May, in Section 44, in Article 5, of the convention enables the enforcing court to force an award, notwithstanding that a Section 44 ground might otherwise be established. Whether a court would so act in such a case would depend in very large measure on the particular circumstances. And that's the sentence I rely upon."
p4,00:17:13.839,00:17:14.030,spk_2,So
p4,00:17:14.030,00:18:22.360,spk_1,"that's a general statement. He then goes on to deal with the particular situation. In that case, if is difficult, I think that should be it rather than if, It is difficult to imagine that a court would do so if enforcement were contrary to public policy, but there is no reason why a court could not do so. Whereas here the factual foundation for the public policy arises from an alleged non-compliance with the rules governing the arbitration to which the party complaining failed to make a prompt objection, keeping the point up at sleeve, at least where the irregularity might be cured. Whether one describes the respondents conduct, and this is where I bring in conduct, as giving rise to an estoppel, a breach of a bona fide principal, or simply as a breach of principle that, as a matter of non-compliance with the governing rules, should be raised promptly in the arbitration is beside the point in this case, on any one of these bases the respondent's conduct, in failing to raise in the arbitration its objection arising from the communications to the chief arbitrator, was such as to justify the Court of Enforcement in enforcing the award. And then he says, He doesn't need to deal with the other point, and"
p4,00:18:23.240,00:18:23.560,spk_2,
p4,00:18:24.040,00:18:30.880,spk_1,"there are some other points which I referred to in the case also from this case, like the unification of"
p4,00:18:30.880,00:18:32.540,spk_0,"standards, so --"
p4,00:18:32.540,00:18:44.110,spk_3,If it was simply a preach of procedural rules which wasn't drawn to the attention of the arbitration -- I can't see how actually you could get anywhere near the public policy exception at all?
p4,00:18:44.130,00:18:54.760,spk_1,"Well, I agree. But the point I was making was not from the facts of the case, but the two statements, one that you look at the particular circumstances of the case, and two that you can consider common."
p4,00:18:54.770,00:19:08.500,spk_3,"I mean, the point I was making is that they seem to me, on the face of it, have been considering it at a stage later than it actually arose. You could simply have said there's no question of public policy if there's point of procedure."
p4,00:19:08.500,00:19:12.230,spk_1,Well I think they said that as well. But I think they were dealing with a second point.
p4,00:19:12.240,00:19:26.020,spk_5,"But I still have some difficulty in seeing how you could have a situation where a court could properly enforce an award against a person who it had just held wasn't a party to the agreement, and gave the arbitrators, which was the"

p4,00:19:27.390,00:19:33.050,spk_5,which gave the arbitrators the authority to do what they have done. I just can't think
p4,00:19:33.060,00:19:33.870,spk_0,"myself, I mean"
p4,00:19:34.590,00:19:48.200,spk_5,"the reasons you've give in your skeleton are really going back to the point we're on before, that one should have regard to what arbitrators do and son, and I could see that may or may not come in earlier, but --"
p4,00:19:49.650,00:20:02.400,spk_1,"Well it can, it may come in at two stages, but it can, in our submission, come in at this stage because if this contradictory conduct, it perhaps --"
p4,00:20:02.410,00:20:05.910,spk_5,I can see you can say that the government are a shower and they had absolutely no business pulling
p4,00:20:06.240,00:20:08.300,spk_0,A
p4,00:20:08.570,00:20:13.440,spk_5,"rug from under your client's feet, and the whole underlying idea of the MOU to which they were"
p4,00:20:13.440,00:20:14.930,spk_0,a party by
p4,00:20:14.940,00:20:26.040,spk_5,"failing to resurrect the trust, I quite see that, you could say that's disgraceful conduct, that's mala fide, it might be all kinds of causes of action you might have. But here we're only looking at"
p4,00:20:26.050,00:20:26.850,spk_3,the
p4,00:20:27.140,00:20:28.720,spk_5,question of whether they were a party to this
p4,00:20:28.720,00:20:29.910,spk_0,"agreement,"
p4,00:20:30.130,00:20:36.260,spk_5,and at the moment in which we would be exercising the discretion would be after the court had held that they were not parties to the agreement?
p4,00:20:37.440,00:21:31.420,spk_1,"Well, I accept that, but, at the same time, that discretion is there, and it is obviously will depend upon, as I said, or as I submitted, the facts of each case so that you could have contradictory or dilatory behaviour, for example, you could have as, I'm not alleging it as such, but you could have bad specific, really bad, bad faith. Or you could have a waiver, you could have estoppel, the golden thread, we say, is what is the justice here of the case when looking at it in the round, remembering that we are looking here at international arbitration, the pro-enforcement policy of the New York convention, we would submit the golden thread is the justice of the case."
p4,00:21:32.060,00:21:33.990,spk_4,So it's a sort of lifting of the veil approach?
p4,00:21:34.000,00:22:15.370,spk_0,"Surely the golden thread surely is an agreement by the parties to submit a matter too an arbitral tribunal. And if you haven't got that agreement, I rather share Lord Clarke's view, as he's expressed a moment ago, it's very difficult to see how, once a court asked to enforce the award has decided that there was no agreement between the parties, to refer a matter or any matter to arbitration. Nevertheless, despite the absence of such an"
p4,00:22:15.370,00:22:15.960,spk_3,"agreement,"
p4,00:22:16.650,00:22:23.250,spk_0,somehow the party in question is bound by what the arbitrators have said.
p4,00:22:24.010,00:22:41.820,spk_1,"Well, my I make two comments. Obviously, the first comment that I made is there is a limited discretion. It's not defined in the New York Convention. The second is you might have a case where, in a sense, this case could fall into, where it is a borderline"
p4,00:22:41.830,00:22:42.950,spk_2,"case, where"
p4,00:22:42.950,00:22:53.310,spk_1,"it is not clear whether or not they consented, where it is impossible for, on the evidence, for a judge really to come to a clear --"
p4,00:22:53.800,00:22:55.960,spk_5,But in that case they wouldn't satisfy the burden of proof.
p4,00:22:56.640,00:23:13.400,spk_1,"Well, yes, yes and no. I mean, I see that in the first instance that you would have to, on the balance of probabilities, but it may nonetheless be a very much a borderline case, in which case the tribunal might look at it differently."
p4,00:23:13.410,00:24:09.230,spk_0,"But, with respect, As My Lord Lord Clarke has just said, we're assuming a position where, in this case, the Government of Pakistan has proved that it was not a party to the agreement in this jurisdiction, the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Okay, on the balance of probabilities, there was no agreement between the parties, and I'm finding great difficulty in seeing, nevertheless, leaving aside questions like a estoppel or waiver or anything else like that, nevertheless, the court could ever say, Well, All right, you weren't party to it, There's no way, There's no estoppel, but we're going to hold you to it. I just don't see how it could possibly follow?"
p4,00:24:10.000,00:24:52.760,spk_1,"Well, all I can put to you is that in that situation the court would be looking at the overall justice of the case, and therefore, even in those circumstances, whether it was right by virtue of the contradictory behaviour, nonetheless, to, I mean, I understand, of course, Lord Saville's point. But, whether, nonetheless, that the convention gives the court a right in such circumstances because of the way that the party has behaved, to say that in the circumstances of this case, the award should be enforced. My Lord --"
p4,00:24:52.770,00:25:12.230,spk_0,"I follow that submission if you're relying on specific legal principles like [inaudible] and so on. But I'm finding it difficult even with a concept like, The justice of the case, where none of those things arise, and the only thing that's been established is that there was never an agreement between the parties."
p4,00:25:13.240,00:25:38.390,spk_1,"Well, My Lord, those are my submissions. It is a short point because it's the question of what, May, mean in the context of the New York Convention. And our submission is it is not circumscribed. And we would, we still reiterate, and if I can just give you that briefly --"
p4,00:25:38.400,00:26:12.930,spk_3,"I mean it sounds like the absolute classic palm tree. It sounds as if you're inviting the courts to say, Well, They very nearly agreed, Or it looks as nearly won. As My Lord says, we apply the balance of probabilities. But on your test, you know, they had a 40% chance of success, they've lost. Why? On the balance, on the palm tree principle, why not award them 40% of the award? That's not how courts work, we we arrive at a decision, and that's the answer, in general."
p4,00:26:13.000,00:26:36.300,spk_1,"But you do have arguments such as waiver or estoppel, which would meet the case. And there may be situations which are one below that, in the circumstances of this case, which would nonetheless entitle the court to say that this case should be enforced. Can I just very briefly canter through my ten reasons as to why we say you should enforce it? And just to make good that point,"
p4,00:26:36.570,00:26:38.190,spk_4,Are these are set out in the case?
p4,00:26:38.190,00:26:44.960,spk_1,"Most of them are, there are perhaps a couple more I could add, rather than Your Lordships."
p4,00:26:44.970,00:26:46.830,spk_0,The
p4,00:26:46.840,00:27:03.560,spk_1,"first point I just want to mention is the position in France. Your Lordship will have seen that we put, as a separate ground, although I rely on it in the context of discretion, estoppel, that was on the basis of a statement that the government was not going to go to"
p4,00:27:03.560,00:27:05.450,spk_0,France. Yes.
p4,00:27:06.040,00:28:12.670,spk_1,"Since then, and since our application, before the application, because of the Court of Appeal decision, although we are no longer obliged to do so, and as you heard, the whole purpose of the New York Convention was to avoid this, we have lodged proceedings for enforcement in France. Since then, the Government have put in a detailed opposition to that, and therefore, to an extent, that takes away the finality argument for the purpose of arguing before this court that there has been an estoppel. And therefore I wasn't proposing to argue estoppel as a separate issue. But I, nonetheless, wish to retain it in the context of the discretion, because we foresaw it would be difficult for this court to say that there was an estoppel when the French courts are actually about to determine the issue, and therefore the finality argument, as of today's date, would be difficult for you. Nonetheless, it is relevant in the contents of the discretion."
p4,00:28:12.840,00:28:19.320,spk_5,"Sorry, I haven't quite understood this. The government said that they weren't going to go to France, what to do, just, they weren't going to set aside the award?"
p4,00:28:19.320,00:28:42.270,spk_1,"They weren't going to set aside the award. But what happens in France is if you seek to enforce, you have a month in which to oppose it, and therefore, when my client's sought recently to enforce, the government then, effectively, unless they were going to let it ride, went, have put in an application to resist that enforcement --"
p4,00:28:42.450,00:28:44.160,spk_5,And also to set aside the award?
p4,00:28:44.320,00:28:44.480,spk_1,And to set aside the award.
p4,00:28:45.850,00:28:46.490,spk_5,And to set aside the award. Yes.
p4,00:28:46.500,00:29:25.620,spk_1,"It's part and parcel of the same. But they didn't do it on their own initiative, they did it because we went there to enforce. And the point, it seemed to us, that it would be very difficult for Your Lordships to argue as a separate issue, for us to say it was final now, when the matter is going to be determined by the French courts, that's a different issue as to the question of estoppel in the context of discretion, because that is a separate issue. So we were not going to pursue that separate issue before Your Lordships in the light of what's happened since the appeal, because we couldn't see how Your Lordships could say it was final if the matter is currently before the French courts."
p4,00:29:26.220,00:29:43.050,spk_5,"And is there an issue in those proceedings whether or not whoever wins, whoever loses in these proceedings, is estopped from arguing the point in France, or are you waiting to see who wins before deciding who is going to be on which side of that argument? I'm not sure, I'm not sure."
p4,00:29:43.050,00:29:47.350,spk_3,"It's presumably not, I mean, any judgement we give is outside the Brussels"
p4,00:29:47.350,00:29:48.260,spk_1,"regulations. It is indeed, yes."
p4,00:29:48.270,00:29:57.680,spk_3,"But if you applied the Sena [inaudible] English proceeding principles of issue estoppel, it would be binding, but that depends whether the French have that?"
p4,00:29:57.940,00:30:24.920,spk_1,"Well, indeed. But one of the arguments, the arguments, before the court below was because they hadn't, has said they were not going to France, therefore, from the perspective of conduct and their own attitude, they had effectively, were estopped from saying that the award was not binding."
p4,00:30:25.110,00:30:30.670,spk_5,"Mind you if we're testing that today, I mean, you've only got yourselves, themselves, to blame, really, now they've gone to France."
p4,00:30:30.850,00:30:33.230,spk_1,"Well, My Lord, That's why we're not doing that."
p4,00:30:33.240,00:30:34.830,spk_5,"Well, how is it relevant to discretion either?"
p4,00:30:35.040,00:31:06.630,spk_1,"Well it is relevant to discretion because there's a distinction between, this is part of the, there's a distinction between them positively saying, as they did, they are not going to contest it, as at the time of the issue of enforcement, and us now, because of what's happened in the English Court, being compelled to do something which the New York Convention specifically endeavoured to avoid us having to do, namely to go to the court of the seat, effectively for a double [inaudible]."
p4,00:31:06.850,00:31:12.790,spk_5,"But you're not going to the court of the seat of are you? You're going to France qua, but that's only qua enforcement court?"
p4,00:31:12.820,00:31:22.290,spk_1,"But that's the only way you can do it. That's the only way we can do it, the only way we can get the issue before the French courts by seeking to enforce --"
p4,00:31:22.290,00:31:23.890,spk_3,"What did they say, as a matter interest?"
p4,00:31:23.900,00:31:25.150,spk_4,Where was it
p4,00:31:25.150,00:31:27.510,spk_3,in relation to the French proceedings? Where is it in your case?
p4,00:31:27.830,00:31:29.500,spk_1,"It's set out, I think, in the agreed statement"
p4,00:31:38.060,00:31:39.960,spk_0,of facts.
p4,00:31:39.970,00:31:41.330,spk_3,"Oh, yes I see Paragraph 73, Yes."
p4,00:31:45.830,00:31:46.260,spk_0,Well all
p4,00:31:46.260,00:31:52.460,spk_3,"they said is that they weren't going get to challenge, they weren't to take positive steps to challenge the award in French"
p4,00:31:52.460,00:31:54.550,spk_1,"courts. They said, yes."
p4,00:31:54.560,00:31:55.940,spk_3,"Well, they weren't"
p4,00:31:55.940,00:31:56.340,spk_0,"obliged to. Indeed, indeed."
p4,00:31:57.970,00:32:02.530,spk_3,"No, so it's a non -point isn't it? It would always have been a non-point?"
p4,00:32:02.540,00:32:16.330,spk_1,"Well it wouldn't with respect, because, if one at that stage was looking irrespective what happened subsequently, as to whether or not the award in France was final, the problem with France is many jurisdictions have a time limit, as we do, 28 days."
p4,00:32:16.580,00:32:19.660,spk_3,"Yes, well they had a month from the time when you sought to enforce."
p4,00:32:19.670,00:32:35.420,spk_1,"But, with respect, there's a difference. There is no time limit unless we seek to enforce. So under French law, in theory, you can apply to set aside at any time. And that's the difference. There's no time limit."
p4,00:32:35.420,00:32:51.450,spk_3,"Why should they if they didn't have any assets there? It's the old story of somebody commences an arbitration in a jurisdiction, or proceedings in a jurisdiction with which you say you've got nothing to do and you never agreed and never submitted, you're entitled to just say, You do what you can there and see whether you can enforce?"
p4,00:32:51.460,00:33:40.670,spk_1,"Well it's the Svenska point, where, in the Svenska case, it was held as they hadn't been, the fact that the law is slightly different, it was Danish law, but the expert evidence in that case was that although there wasn't a time limit in Denmark, nonetheless, it was reasonable to assume that the award was final. It just went to the finality point, but to a certain extent, as I said, it cannot, we have initiated those proceedings in France because -- but contrary to what was the underlying intention of the Convention to have to do so, so the point being the only reason I raise it"
p4,00:33:40.840,00:33:41.080,spk_0,in
p4,00:33:41.080,00:34:06.490,spk_1,"the context of discretion is although, as Your Lordship quite rightly says, There was no obligation to do so on the part of the government, as at that point of time, subject to the fact that we have subsequently gone to enforce, there was a finality, we would submit, or an indication that after all, seven or eight years of lapse, that there must come a"
p4,00:34:06.490,00:34:07.130,spk_0,point
p4,00:34:07.140,00:34:27.210,spk_1,"where that award would be final and therefore them having decided not to set it aside, and they were entitled to, but it is a further ground in our submission simply to look at the overall conduct in relation to the government"
p4,00:34:27.220,00:34:33.790,spk_4,So can I be quite clear? The point rests then on the last sentence of what you quote in Paragraph 73 in the --
p4,00:34:35.750,00:34:41.050,spk_1,"Yes, in fact if one looks at the letter, which is in bundle D, I have a feeling --"
p4,00:34:41.310,00:34:41.460,spk_4,That's the one we looked at earlier? --

p4,00:34:45.639,00:34:51.919,spk_4,"Right, it's a letter we looked at earlier, isn't it? Paragraph 73."
p4,00:34:58.320,00:35:05.020,spk_3,"The advice by the French lawyers may well have been, You'd be mad to come to France when you haven't got any assets here and there's no need to do"
p4,00:35:05.020,00:35:05.650,spk_4,it. Yes.
p4,00:35:06.440,00:35:10.080,spk_5,"Or it might have been, I wouldn't come here if I were you the French Court will undoubtedly uphold the award [laughter]."

p4,00:35:16.680,00:35:18.610,spk_5,"It's probably that advice that prompted your clients to give it a go in France, I bet."
p4,00:35:22.240,00:35:25.620,spk_1,I think the only other points that --
p4,00:35:25.630,00:35:33.910,spk_5,"But I think the idea it's jolly rotten that your clients had to go to France. And what your clients did, they went in England, they've only gone to France, and now they've lost in England."
p4,00:35:34.540,00:35:34.860,spk_1,
p4,00:35:35.240,00:35:36.280,spk_2,"Well,"
p4,00:35:36.290,00:35:58.830,spk_1,"but, My Lord, one of the problems, of course, which pervades this case, is that there is a difference, however much an English court is used to it and does apply a foreign law to facts, from the court itself applies its own to the facts, however, however much, is an English Court is imbued with the, by"
p4,00:35:58.830,00:36:00.330,spk_2,experts as to
p4,00:36:00.330,00:36:01.490,spk_1,what the law is --
p4,00:36:01.920,00:36:10.030,spk_5,"I don't follow that because clients could have gone to France on that basis, got the thing and all of the enforcement in France, and then you had a jolly good issue estoppel here."
p4,00:36:10.040,00:36:21.290,spk_1,"But when asked rhetorically, Why should, because this is not what the Convention said. The Convention specifically, unlike the Geneva Convention, says, You do not need to go to the"
p4,00:36:21.290,00:36:22.320,spk_0,seat to get
p4,00:36:22.330,00:36:46.040,spk_1,"enforcement. That's the whole point of the New York Convention, was to avoid the need to do that. And it was only because of what happened here that that course was taken, but that shouldn't be an obligation on our part. We should be entitled to seek to enforce in any of the 144 countries in the world that we want to. We don't have to go, under the New York Convention, to the seat first."
p4,00:36:46.430,00:37:00.250,spk_5,"No but there's nothing in the convention that suggests that if you lose in enforcement country A, that you should be free to go around to the other 143 countries to have the very same point relitigated. There's no suggestion that that affect, to me."

p4,00:37:07.730,00:37:15.910,spk_1,"There is nothing, as I've said, there is nothing, would have been nothing to stop us to go simultaneously, for example, for different courts."
p4,00:37:15.910,00:37:24.570,spk_4,"Well you might want to do that where there are not sufficient assets in individual countries, quite apart from issue estoppel, you might just wish to go around the world enforcing your award."
p4,00:37:25.030,00:37:25.230,spk_2,So
p4,00:37:25.930,00:37:35.290,spk_1,"I think the only, a couple, I won't repeat the points that I made about discretion, but just one or two new points that perhaps have arisen during the course of the debate --"
p4,00:37:35.660,00:37:36.370,spk_5,I'm
p4,00:37:36.380,00:37:43.140,spk_4,sorry to go back to these reasons. I'm looking at page 91 of your written case where you really draw together

p4,00:37:44.550,00:37:52.870,spk_4,propositions that are in the case. Is that what we should be looking at now? Or is there something else in the written case we should have in front of us?
p4,00:37:53.020,00:37:55.250,spk_1,That sets up the French position.
p4,00:37:56.630,00:37:57.690,spk_4,Page 91?

p4,00:38:22.880,00:38:28.450,spk_1,"they have one month within which to say there are opposing enforcement, which is what they've done."
p4,00:38:29.020,00:38:29.380,spk_0,So
p4,00:38:29.380,00:38:36.020,spk_1,the only way that they effectively could be brought to a head in France is if we bring

p4,00:38:37.880,00:38:38.500,spk_1,That's how it

There was some talk about vague alternative remedies, we're looking into this, but my recollection is that there was some, it wasn't unopposed view, and the remedies were remedies which were not easily available to my clients. Overnight we're going to see if we can get an agreed position on that so that Your Lordships are aware of the position. The other thing is that, as I mentioned, during my earlier submissions, this was a situation where my clients, said against me, where my clients took a commercial risk. But my clients have been lending to the government for a number of years, had been providing Islamic finance and had no problems as far as I'm aware, the money had been repaid. One would assume that they were entitled, therefore, to rely upon a state, sovereign state, particularly given their past experience. And what they found here was that effectively, the contract was taken from under them and they were left without any recourse, and, we would submit, in breach of what our international commercial obligations. And so it was that injustice which underscored the tribunal's decision, and we would submit should also be relevant in the exercise of the discretion, because here you have a government involvement in the MOU, a government involvement in the formation of the Trust, a government involvement in keeping the Trust alive for two promulgations, government involvement in deciding to allow it to elapse, government involvement in the letter, and a government involvement in two court proceedings. And so they are now seeking, if their right, to walk away from that on the basis that there isn't an agreement, and looking, as we said, at the overall justice, My Lord, we would submit that the right approach, even if you were wrong, against us, on the argument as to whether or not they were a party, should be nonetheless, in the special circumstances of this case, to enforce the award. My Lord, finally, because I know my friends will make a point of this, of course the government of Pakistan is a state, and of course it has sovereign"

Interpreting a person's mind for objective behaviour, and the essential difference between the tribunal and the court was reading into an individual's mind, who has not come to give evidence, on whom the onus of proof rests, as to what he thought when he was writing that letter.

I mean, suppose somebody goes into the witness box and says what my subjective intentions were, but there were no external indicia, would be intentionally established as a matter of French law?"

At 7, Mr Justice Aikens, Monsieur [inaudible], In English law there is a distinction between an objective intention of parties to a contract, that is to say, the intention of such party as manifested to the other party by what is said, what is written, or what is done. On the other hand, There is the subject intention of a party, which is the intention that each party has in its own mind or in internal documents or what is said within each party's boundaries but is not indicated to the other party.

p4,00:46:26.870,00:46:27.790,spk_2,described them?
p4,00:46:27.880,00:46:33.500,spk_1,It is a difficult question because we don't recognise such a distinction in French law. On the other

p4,00:46:34.360,00:47:28.180,spk_1,"French judge seeks the subjective intention, but he may deduce the subjective intention from objective behaviour in arbitration cases. The case law shows that the intention of the party subjected to arbitration may lead it to the liability of a party that was not a signatory to the arbitration, but in this case, the intention of the party and then Mr corrects it. The word is involvement. The involvement of a party that was not a signatory to the contract must be manifesting positive. So what that means is that the case law seeks through the objective conduct of the party it's subjective intention. The assessment is indeed towards subjective intention, as can be seen in the case of the so called pyramid case where, although the Egyptian government was involved in the arbitration, the Court of Appeal judges have been its intention to submit to arbitration. Do you mean involved in the arbitration? Sorry."
p4,00:47:28.550,00:47:39.200,spk_3,Doesn't the answer at line 11 and 12 give the answer to Lord Hopes question The involvement of the party who was not a signatory to contract must be manifest and positive?

The respondent, as Your Lordships is aware as a governmental entity it claims state immunity, the government of Pakistan has maintained that reservation throughout these proceedings, has pleaded state immunity as a separate head in response to the original order of Mr Justice Christopher Clarke. That point is not argued separately simply because in the light of Svenska and Lithuania, it is coterminous with the question under Section 9 of the State Immunity Act, whether or not the government Pakistan was bound by an arbitration agreement. Having said that, for the purpose of doubt, the government maintains that there has been no waiver and that it holds its reservation and nothing in its participation in these proceedings must be taken as a waiver of any sort."

p4,00:58:53.200,01:01:29.020,spk_2,"that Your Lordships have outlined for me with a general overview, which I promise won't 
take long. This case, if one steps back from the heat of the argument, has been portrayed, in particular by my learned friend, as a case where the English court has come to an anti-arbitration position, the New York Convention is said to be pro enforcement. This is said to be a rare and surprising instance of the non-recognition, non-enforcement, of an award with few previous examples, and a potential blot on England's reputation as an international centre for international arbitration. That, in my submission, is a completely wrong characterisation of what has taken place in this case. It's quite an important characterisation to debunk because of the ripples through the international arbitral community after this case, in the light of this case, and it's important that it's made clear in my submission what actually happened in this case, which has not been perhaps universally understood, or perhaps understood in sufficient detail. In this case, what happened simply, before Mr Justice Aikens and before the Court of Appeal was the proper application of the New York Convention as it was originally intended, no different from what would happen before the courts of France, see SPP and the Pyramids case, which we will come to later, no different from the courts of the United States, from the courts of Switzerland, the courts of any of the recognised international arbitral centres. The essence of this case, My Lords, is that the government of Pakistan maintains it never agreed to arbitration at all. The issue is initial consent, that is the key characterising feature of the case. It is not a case about the scope of the tribunal's jurisdiction. It is not a case about the nature of their determination. It is a question, the logically prior question, was there an arbitral tribunal at all? My learned friends' arguments, in different formulations, come to what sort of deference should this court give to an award? Should there be a presumption? There are cases in Canada, the United States, that have been put before this court, where presumptions are applied. Should there be some special weight"

p4,01:01:30.270,01:01:34.690,spk_2,None of those cases involved initial consent.
p4,01:01:34.700,01:01:49.430,spk_4,"So if we were further down the line, and obviously if we were faced with an issue about substance, it would take on a completely different aspect, would it? Yes. So your point is, we're right back at this stage one, at the very foundation of the agreement itself?"
p4,01:01:50.710,01:02:13.340,spk_2,"My Lord, yes, and when I get to it, I will show Your Lordships that there is a principled analysis of Article 5 of the New York Convention. Article 5 comprises a number of different types of grounds. You can do a very simple exercise, through Article 5, of going through each one and asking the question, does it assume that there is an arbitration agreement and a valid"
p4,01:02:13.340,01:02:14.980,spk_0,tribunal? Or
p4,01:02:14.990,01:02:17.240,spk_2,does it raise the initial question?
p4,01:02:17.250,01:02:18.750,spk_0,"So, my Lords,"

p4,01:02:22.330,01:02:23.120,spk_4,shortly.
p4,01:02:23.690,01:02:44.710,spk_2,"And for those grounds in Article 5, where there is no assumption that there actually is an agreement at all or a valid arbitral tribunal, then there's no basis for a court, as a matter of logic, as well as the intentions of the New York Convention, there's no basis to treat the alleged arbitral award with any particular deference."

p4,01:02:53.020,01:03:43.880,spk_2,"Yes, indeed. Each each of them is covered by, May, we don't of course, that's absolutely right. But as My Lord, Lord Mance, I think raised earlier the point, there's nothing in either the history, the language, the scheme of the New York Convention to suggest that it is the same discretion test that is applied to each of these grounds because some are very different analytically. For example, Article 5(1)(a) raises the question of initial consent, at that point, as we are in this case, there is only an alleged arbitral tribunal. Article 5(2)(a), in contrast, is a question of public policy, that assumes that there is an agreement to arbitration, it assumes that there is a valid, legitimate, arbitral tribunal with status."

p4,01:03:45.230,01:04:23.040,spk_2,"that point, as Mr Justice Coleman and then the Court of Appeal in the West Acre case did, the court would, of course, pay some deference to that arbitral tribunal's consideration of the issue of public policy. Not that it's bound by it. But, of course, that would carry some weight, because at that point you are dealing with an arbitral tribunal that is an arbitral tribunal, it has a right to form a view on the issues. Whether or not that's persuasive to the English court will depend upon how good that determination is, but that shows that Article 5(2)(a) is not the same as 5(1)(a ), 5(1)(a) raises the logically prior"

p4,01:05:24.260,01:05:33.290,spk_3,"But I think you can get the importance of their being an agreement. The fundamental agreement is to recognise what has been agreed in writing,"

The analysis, if I may, with respect say in Dardana and Yukos is absolutely right, was absolutely right in terms of the stages, and all of this gets shifted into Article 5. You can't resolve it before Article 5 without disturbing the burden of proof, so that must be right. But then, if you are left with, May, in Article 5 , one has to make sense of it. And that, of course, as with any international convention, has to be made sense with respect to purpose and object and whatever customary international law features, perhaps in the Vienna Convention. But My Lords I will come to that if I may, in order to give the logic of the argument a little bit more detailed when I analyse each of these provisions."

p4,01:20:26.710,01:20:27.430,spk_2,"Under Section 72, yes."

p4,01:21:14.360,01:21:24.000,spk_2,"you then say, well, in fact, there's a different standard of proof, or deference, or presumptions, what you're doing is you are cutting back on Article 5 when Article 5 is already cut"

You have to find the gateway into it. And the point is that you that gateway is carefully monitored. If you break down the walls and start applying arbitration to everybody, it becomes a different thing."

p4,01:21:53.810,01:23:08.350,spk_3,"inappropriate for the future. But you've referred to the American distinction between arguments about the scope of an award and arguments about whether there was an arbitration agreement at all. I mean, I can see that if you've got an arbitration body, one would give particular attention to their view as to whether an issue was within their powers. But as a matter of logic, if an issue arose under Article 5(1)(c) as to whether the award dealt with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, as a matter of logic, it's difficult to see why the court's approach to that should be any different from its approach to question whether there is a valid arbitration agreement at all. And the issue is, essentially, whether there's a valid arbitration agreement covering what was decided, and that should be an issue which a party is entitled to come to court to argue and have decided, if a party hasn't submitted something to arbitration, then it hasn't submitted it."

If you want to apply any kind of particular presumption, you can only do so, in my submission, once you've got beyond the initial question."
p4,01:24:54.000,01:25:47.800,spk_4,"But is there any difference between C and D, as opposed to the proposition relating to (b) in Section 103, indeed Article 5. Probably easier to look at the article, actually, if you wouldn't mind? Oh, of the Convention? Yes, the Convention, if you've got that readily to hand, just to try to follow out for the point, I mean, I can see the point about the starting point. The absolutely fundamental start which we get in (a), but what about (d), the procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or not in accordance with the law where the country took place. There you've got a, well you would say, Well, you've got an undoubted agreement. And what was concerned with there is is is something less fundamental, this way, the agreement has actually been worked out is it, is there a difference then in the exercise?"
p4,01:25:48.390,01:25:50.140,spk_2,"My Lord, the question"
p4,01:25:50.290,01:25:50.800,spk_3,that I
p4,01:25:50.800,01:26:26.430,spk_2,"would suggest, I would submit that gets asked, one should ask for each of these grounds, there are two questions. One is Is there a valid arbitration agreement? Secondly, does the alleged arbitral tribunal, whose award one's looking at, actually have status? Now you have to ask those two questions for each of these grounds, when one gets to the ground, such as the procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, it is possible that the procedure for the appointment of the tribunal was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties. Then you are dealing with an alleged tribunal, not a real tribunal."
p4,01:26:26.460,01:26:30.850,spk_4,"So the composition of the tribunal, which is the first few words there, is fundamental?"
p4,01:26:30.850,01:26:53.730,spk_2,"Yes, because the court is being asked to give some special reverence to an award of an alleged tribunal. So the prior question, there are two prior questions, the one is, Have you agreed to arbitration? Secondly, that tribunals was it a real tribunal? And in my submission, one can ask, quite simply, those two questions for each of these grounds."
p4,01:26:53.730,01:27:29.740,spk_5,"And if the answer to those, both those questions is, yes, remaining questions, even though they may be jurisdictional questions, and you can take My Lord, Lord Mance's point. For example, you might, there are lots of disputes go on about what the scope of what the true construction of the contract is, suppose you, refer questions relating to the marriage [inaudible] to an arbitrator, well there might be scope for dispute whether a particular dispute was acclaimed for the marriage, or not. That sort of issue, where does that fit into the analysis?"
p4,01:27:29.750,01:27:33.760,spk_2,"If it's jurisdictional, you are bound by kompetenz-kompetenz --"
p4,01:27:33.770,01:27:42.170,spk_5,"Even though you've got a you've got a valid arbitration agreement, and you've got a tribunal with status, so there aren't only two questions? Sorry. Those aren't the only two questions?"
p4,01:27:42.350,01:27:44.400,spk_2,But those are the essential questions.
p4,01:27:44.400,01:27:49.180,spk_5,"Yes but if both those are answered yes, are you into a different part of the analysis or are you? --"
p4,01:27:49.180,01:27:59.230,spk_2,"No because you're, those two questions are asked with the underlying kompetenz-kompetenz principle throughout all of this. Some of these grounds don't go to kompetenz-kompetenz, for example, public policy, West Acre."
p4,01:27:59.460,01:28:09.080,spk_3,"I think you're distinguishing between all questions which go to jurisdiction over the issues decided and other questions such as procedure, whether the"

p4,01:28:14.180,01:28:19.500,spk_5,"But it might be a question of construction of the arbitration clause, mightn't it? Because if you answer questions one and two,"

p4,01:28:20.620,01:28:22.070,spk_5,"might be possible to say,"

p4,01:28:22.750,01:28:30.450,spk_5,"relation to the point I put a moment ago, well the parties intended that questions of that kind should themselves be decided by the arbitration?"
p4,01:28:30.690,01:28:32.380,spk_2,"Oh certainly, certainly --"
p4,01:28:32.390,01:28:37.950,spk_5,"And they might include what, on analysis would be questions of jurisdiction. Like the many cases on"
p4,01:28:37.960,01:28:38.600,spk_2,what
p4,01:28:38.870,01:28:41.030,spk_4,disputes arising out of this agreement?
p4,01:28:41.350,01:28:46.190,spk_2,"Of course. But the jurisdictional questions, yes, the scope of the clause, of course."
p4,01:28:47.300,01:28:50.820,spk_3,"That was the issue in Occidental and Ecuador, wasn't it, the scope of the arbitration?"
p4,01:28:51.230,01:29:06.730,spk_2,"Yes, and interestingly, that case was a good example where, in order to answer it, one had to look at what might be thought to be real merits questions because you are construing a BIT, but still it comes to kompetenz-kompetenz in my submission because it's jurisdictional."
p4,01:29:06.740,01:29:13.830,spk_3,"And they were actually decided in the courts, weren't they, subsequently, there was a detailed judgement holding that it was within the jurisdiciton?"
p4,01:29:13.830,01:29:31.750,spk_2,"Yes, up to the Court of Appeal, and then they went back to be decided, but when it got to the Court of Appeal first time around in Occidental Ecuador, the question was the construction of Article 10 of the US Ecuador BIT which was about tax measures and because of the construction of the system of the BIT, that --"

p4,01:29:36.220,01:29:37.690,spk_0,You say these points are kompetenz-kompetenz but
p4,01:29:37.690,01:29:40.060,spk_4,actually they're just competence.
p4,01:29:40.660,01:29:53.150,spk_2,"Yes, exactly, I'm using kompetenz with a K is a technical term. But actually, if this court if I may say with respect, do a favour to the international arbitral community, it would be to abandon the term kompetenz-kompetenz with a K, because it's entirely misleading."
p4,01:29:53.810,01:29:56.400,spk_4,"Did, and just use the word once?"
p4,01:29:56.870,01:29:58.250,spk_2,Use it once with a C would by much easier.

It had argument put to it on a completely different basis, a factual record that was not gone through in the same detail as it was in front of Mr Justice Aikens and the Court of Appeal. It's a prime example of why you've got to have a de novo hearing. The government of Pakistan, I think it is accepted, had no obligation to turn up in front of this Paris tribunal. It had every right to stand back and wait to see where recognition and enforcement might be sought. Nothing happened in France. An application was made in England so Pakistan came along to England and put its case. Why"

But the characteristic feature of this case, which was found by Mr Justice Aikens and by the Court of Appeal, was that this is a case not just where the government of Pakistan never consented to arbitration, unlike the Svenska case, but similar to the Pyramids case in France. In this case, the government made positive steps not to be bound. It interposed a trust with separate legal personality. It's very difficult in those circumstances to divine a common intention, subjective intention"

p4,01:40:44.750,01:40:50.820,spk_3,we have seen those summarising. The case is the one which refers to the government guarantee for paragraph.

They have political reasons for that. They had. It was in the name of the president of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, compliant with the Pakistan Constitution. That's how If you want to find the state, that's what you do. That's why the president of Dagestan appears so frequently in our law reports. All that was done carefully when it came to the agreement itself. All that was changed. Della had sophisticated lawyers. They knew what they were doing.

p4,01:41:57.410,01:42:27.180,spk_2,"reason for stressing this at the executive summary stage is simply to say this shows why the courts got to have a de novo hearing, because these go fundamentally to the first building block block, which is consent. You can't allow a tribunal to go off on its own exercise, disregard this evidence, and then say, Well the court is now constrained by what the tribunal did to some high level form of review, because then you lose the safeguard."
p4,01:42:27.770,01:42:29.870,spk_4,"Well, can we move beyond the executive summary?"

The question for your purposes, under the French test that the other side rely upon, is if this is the intention at this point, why does it change? There's got to be a confluence of intentions, common intentions, Dallah at this point is intending the Trust to be the party. Why does that change later? We've got no evidence of that at all, that somehow Dallah later thinks no, no, I think it should be the GOP."

p4,01:52:21.930,01:52:23.750,spk_4,this is Dallah's proposal?
p4,01:52:23.750,01:52:24.750,spk_5,"Yes,"
p4,01:52:24.760,01:52:32.080,spk_2,"this is from Mr Shezi Nackvi, who is Dallah's representative, he's the one who signed the witness statement that reliance is placed upon."

p4,01:52:54.850,01:53:11.550,spk_2,"before the agreement was concluded, the Trust already, the ordinance has to be re -promulgated because it lapses every four months. It was next re-promulgated, if you go to page 172,on the 12th of August 1996,"

p4,01:53:13.450,01:53:24.420,spk_2,"this is before the agreement was concluded. So Dallah knows, if they didn't know already, that this trust's life is dependent upon re-promulgation of an ordinance, it's already happened."
p4,01:53:24.430,01:53:29.620,spk_5,"So they say they were relying on the government to do the decent thing and do that, underlying basis of the whole deal, they say?"
p4,01:53:30.110,01:53:35.770,spk_2,"That may be so, but this is a party that has already concluded an MOU with the government and gone through all the formalities need for that."

p4,01:53:40.240,01:53:51.590,spk_2,"because they have a difficulty, they want to say that the MOU continues and therefore is some framework agreement because it's the only contract which the government is bound. But they've never commenced an arbitration under it, so"
p4,01:53:51.600,01:53:52.300,spk_5,I see that -- there we are

p4,01:54:00.470,01:54:04.320,spk_3,there any evidence that Dallah actually got notice of this though?

p4,01:54:25.520,01:54:26.930,spk_3,That's giving evidence.
p4,01:54:26.940,01:54:36.210,spk_2,"No, no, no, I'm going to restrain myself from giving evidence, but the the short answer is I'm not aware of any evidence that Dallah saw this, but --"
p4,01:54:36.630,01:54:50.250,spk_3,"But it's part of your case later that people were acting unaware of the failure to re-promulgate, and I just wonder, actually, whether people are aware at all of the need for re-promulgation? Orr Dignam must have been?"
p4,01:54:52.470,01:55:05.070,spk_2,"That's the point. The point, Orr Dignam must have done their due diligence. That They are instructed to contract with the trust to draft a contract with the trust. They must have worked out what the trust's life was. What was"

p4,01:55:48.900,01:55:50.640,spk_2,of them are this guarantee provision in
p4,01:55:50.640,01:55:51.120,spk_0,Article 2.
p4,01:55:52.400,01:55:53.190,spk_4,"Sorry, what are you looking at now?"
p4,01:55:53.200,01:55:54.450,spk_2,"I've gone to the agreement, as Your Lord Lord Clarke asked me."
p4,01:55:55.240,01:55:56.320,spk_4,So we're looking at page 191?
p4,01:55:57.300,01:55:57.460,spk_5,Yes.
p4,01:55:57.470,01:56:04.170,spk_4,"Where I was too, because the second line refers to the ordinance, so a draughtsman or any lawyer drafting would put it in --"
p4,01:56:06.230,01:56:10.570,spk_2,"The draftsman knew the ordinance, must have checked the ordinance, and that's a telling point. Why identify it with such specificity?"
p4,01:56:11.130,01:56:11.700,spk_0,It's
p4,01:56:11.700,01:56:13.060,spk_2,by reference to that ordinance.
p4,01:56:13.060,01:56:14.270,spk_5,And who drafted this?
p4,01:56:14.280,01:56:16.990,spk_2,"Orr Dignam, Dallah's lawyers."
p4,01:56:17.570,01:56:28.180,spk_5,"And HAVE the guarantor, have a guarantee rather, the Clause 2 guarantee, had that been in each of the previous drafts, well, since the trust came on the scene?"
p4,01:56:30.650,01:56:33.450,spk_2,"The previous drafts of this agreement,"
p4,01:56:33.460,01:56:34.460,spk_0,yes.
p4,01:56:34.930,01:56:43.140,spk_3,"Actually, it's quite interesting that reference to the ordinance for all that Orr Dignam are supposed supposed to be experts. They got the wrong one."
p4,01:56:43.150,01:56:44.110,spk_4,"They've got the original,"
p4,01:56:44.290,01:56:47.080,spk_3,"the original one, so they're not conscious at the moment."
p4,01:56:47.090,01:57:13.830,spk_2,"And the point is that the ordinances come and go by effluxion of time but I'm faced with an argument about good faith and about what should have been known, what was known. So, on both sides with, there's a question of, if one's talking about balancing the merits, there's this question of, well, perhaps Dallah ought to have known as well? Certainly they are grown up commercial entity that should have done its proper due diligence, and on any view, at this point they are intending to contract with a trust."
p4,01:57:13.830,01:57:15.290,spk_3,Does subjective

p4,01:57:30.120,01:57:30.360,spk_5,it.
p4,01:57:31.630,01:57:35.860,spk_2,But the French legal test --
p4,01:57:35.860,01:57:37.650,spk_5,Very few cases are decided in the long grass.

p4,01:57:41.310,01:57:43.120,spk_5,that.
p4,01:57:43.130,01:57:48.460,spk_2,"The French test is a subjective test, but that may be to be parked in a moment, for a moment."
p4,01:57:48.830,01:57:54.930,spk_4,"The agreement, of course, may have been drafted some time before it was signed and one has to --"
p4,01:57:54.930,01:57:57.420,spk_2,But we know it passed through the hands of the government ministries who are looking
p4,01:57:57.420,01:57:58.440,spk_5,"at it, and if"
p4,01:57:58.440,01:58:27.200,spk_2,"they had intend it to be bound, they would have picked up the point that, for example, they're not named. It went went through the Ministry of Law. We've got documents on that here. I won't give the reference because I've only got one life left, I think, on documents. But it went through the Ministry of Finance that went through the Ministry of Law. They have not made any observation, for example, that Pakistan is not mentioned, doesn't name the President of Pakistan, consistent with Article 173 of the Constitution ,so we know their intention seems to be,"
p4,01:58:27.550,01:58:28.180,spk_0,one
p4,01:58:28.180,01:58:35.900,spk_2,"can deduce, it seems to be clear for the documents as well Dallah's. And, of course, the points on the agreement, you already have. The agreement"
p4,01:58:35.910,01:58:36.430,spk_0,is
p4,01:58:36.620,01:58:40.410,spk_2,drafted in terms of the trust being obligor.
p4,01:58:40.410,01:58:41.340,spk_0,Well all
p4,01:58:41.590,01:58:50.580,spk_5,"this is quite plain. It's perfectly obvious that we have the agreement, there's no hint that the government --"
p4,01:58:50.590,01:58:58.390,spk_2,"They even changed the standard arbitration clause. If you look at Clause 23, which is the agreement upon which"
p4,01:58:58.790,01:59:00.360,spk_0,"Dallah now relies, the"
p4,01:59:00.370,01:59:03.590,spk_2,standard model arbitration clause for the
p4,01:59:04.190,01:59:05.760,spk_0,ICC
p4,01:59:05.760,01:59:06.100,spk_2,which is in your
p4,01:59:06.100,01:59:08.040,spk_0,papers in
p4,01:59:08.040,01:59:08.590,spk_2,"the authorities bundle,"

p4,01:59:12.840,01:59:19.340,spk_2,disputes arising out of or in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled --
p4,01:59:19.350,01:59:20.340,spk_5,And what's the cross reference?
p4,01:59:20.360,01:59:46.040,spk_2,"The reference is authorities bundle 1, tab 10 the ICC rules, and that's got the model ICC Clause in it . They changed that in this contract, and they've written instead, Any dispute or difference of any kind whatsoever between the Trust and Dallah, that's page 199 of volume C, Clause 23 of the agreement."
p4,01:59:46.420,01:59:47.540,spk_3,So
p4,01:59:47.550,01:59:52.650,spk_2,if they had chosen the model ICC clause it might have been broader in terms of parties.
p4,01:59:53.120,01:59:54.120,spk_0,"Well,"
p4,01:59:54.130,01:59:59.290,spk_4,we've reached four o'clock. I don't know whether there's anything you want first refer to before we close.
p4,01:59:59.300,02:00:04.720,spk_3,"Can I just ask one quick question on page 177, going back to these ordinances,"
p4,02:00:04.730,02:00:06.030,spk_0,I
p4,02:00:06.040,02:00:12.380,spk_3,see that the second ordinance refers to the repeal
p4,02:00:12.910,02:00:13.220,spk_0,of
p4,02:00:13.230,02:00:16.120,spk_3,"yet another Trust, which we don't have"
p4,02:00:16.210,02:00:20.650,spk_2,"I believe that's not in the papers, but it's the second re-promulgation."
p4,02:00:20.650,02:00:25.030,spk_3,"So this is the second re- promulgation? Because otherwise you've got a gap in terms of time after four months, yes I see."
p4,02:00:26.160,02:00:29.130,spk_4,"That makes sense, the reference in the agreement is a little odder if it's the first one."
p4,02:00:33.810,02:00:34.140,spk_0,Even more
p4,02:00:34.140,02:00:38.010,spk_4,"inadequate if that's possible. Well shall we leave it there just now, I hope you won't have too much on the facts?"
p4,02:00:38.730,02:00:41.250,spk_2,"No, My Lord, overnight I will decided on my last"

p5,00:00:57.700,00:01:25.170,spk_0,"leave that. [Ianudible], which is just to complete the story of the Pakistan proceedings. I just want to mention the 99 proceedings in order to finish the sequence. And then I'll move off that -- yes -- it seems to me that you've heard enough on the facts. And the point, perhaps if I may focus it for the court, is that Mr Justice Atkins, in the Court of Appeal, have already had thorough reviews of the facts and the question."
p5,00:01:25.520,00:01:32.690,spk_1,"I mean one could take the view, couldn't one that there's a concurrent finding by these two courts on the essential factual points. We don't need a lot more."
p5,00:01:32.700,00:01:51.190,spk_0,"Exactly. And indeed, the only point really for this court is was the test incorrect that was applied to those facts, namely the review. Yes. So I will then focus on two points, which will encompass the [inaudible] that was provided for me yesterday. Firstly, the nature of the review."
p5,00:01:51.230,00:01:59.460,spk_1,"I think Lord Saville's already, I think hinted at the word review, may be unfortunate. So it's the nature of the exercise,"
p5,00:01:59.460,00:02:00.230,spk_0,nature of the exercise
p5,00:02:00.240,00:02:01.480,spk_1,carried out.
p5,00:02:01.490,00:02:45.910,spk_0,"Nature of the exercise to be carried out. In the course of that I wish to come back in a slightly more methodical way to explain competence, competence within -- yes -- within as relevant to that. Secondly, transnational law. Yes. That's all I'm going to cover. Very well, thank you. In order to firstly, to complete the factual story, the one area I wanted to bring to Your Lordship's attention, which was not covered in my learned friends survey, was what happened after the 1998 proceedings in Pakistan. And I can do this, probably just by giving you references rather than asking you to take up the bundle. You will recall that in 1997 the first set of proceedings began in Pakistan."
p5,00:02:45.920,00:02:47.030,spk_1,That
p5,00:02:47.030,00:04:49.050,spk_0,"was the same day as the letter of termination January 1997 20th January 1997. You've been shown that, you will recall the position that was put in those 1997 proceedings and that it ended up with a judgment, a short judgment that invited the claims to be, in their words, agitated by the government instead of the trust. That was a false lead by the learned judge in the court in Pakistan, as it turned out, and you have already got our points on the significance of those 97 proceedings in terms of understanding the letter of termination. Now, what then happened was the 1998 proceedings, which you have been shown. What is significant about those proceedings is that they were commenced shortly after the ICC arbitration started. At that point, everybody is thinking in terms of alter ego and succession, because that's what the Pakistan judge has just said. The ICC arbitration, as Your Lordships' are aware, was begun on the basis of alter ego and succession, and shortly afterwards, by way of reaction, the government picked up the false invitation while the invitation of the Pakistan judge and recast their case as a government's case. And that was the poor cut and paste job that we saw in the 1998 proceedings. For your note, can I point out paragraph's 2 and 14 of the 1998 [inaudible] in the Pakistan proceedings. I can take you to it or just give you the reference. It is, the reference is, bundle e, tab b(1) page 13, and that is an application of Second of June 98. Paragraphs 2 and 14 were picked up by Mr Justice Akins as being significant because they believe"
p5,00:04:49.540,00:04:49.890,spk_1,the
p5,00:04:49.890,00:06:46.890,spk_0,"case that Dallah's putting that somehow this was an admission by the government because it records firstly in paragraph 2 that the trust has lapsed because of exercise of paragraph 89 of the Pakistan Constitution. The four month period had passed, so they record, firstly, that the trust has gone. And then in paragraph 14 of the complaint, the government states that -- sorry that it records its 1997 proceedings that were brought by the trust. And then it records what the judge said, which is that actually, this is a claim that should be brought could be brought in the name of the government because the trust had gone. And the reason I stressed those paragraph's is that again, that's an indication of what the government was intending in 1998. Not that it's now agreed it was a party, but it was taking up this invitation from the judge. Those 1998 proceedings are very significant for Dallah's case, as Your Lordships will be aware, because they put their focus on the latter part of the chronology accepting they have difficulties with the MOU and the agreement, they say, Well, look what happened afterwards through the French test. So the 98 proceedings are important, but these are they were short lived. They were only alive for six months, which is short in the scheme of Pakistan legal proceedings. They were then withdrawn. In my submission, you can take a fair view as to why they were instituted because there was a knee jerk reaction to the ICC arbitration and because a judge had just told the government that they could actually commence proceedings. They were withdrawn in January 1999 on or about 14th, 14th of January. The reference for that the court order is bundle e tab b(10) page 47. On the same day that the 98 proceedings were withdrawn"

These are the 1999 Pakistan proceedings, and that was back on script because the government at that point brought an application before the Pakistan courts to say that the government of Pakistan had never been a party to the agreement."

The easiest place to find is page 48 of the bundle.

And it's not the successor of the trust that there's no privity of contract now. In my submission, what's what's relevant here, as was found by Mr Justice Akins and the Court of Appeal is if you, as you have to do through French eyes, look at the full chronology from beginning to end, you've got the 1998 proceedings sandwiched between, it's a short period of time, sandwiched between 97 where it's the trust bringing a claim and then 99 where the government is saying we're not a party to any of this. If you take a reasonable fair view of that, you can't take that six month period, in my submission, as being an admission by the government that it is a party to the arbitration agreement. If nothing else, one can see reasonably why they acted in that way because the judge gave them a false lead, but also through French eyes. The test is whether it's subjective or objective. Were they -- are they to be taken as having accepted an arbitration clause. Well, in my submission, starting a court proceeding is a curious way of accepting an arbitration clause."

p5,00:10:07.630,00:10:09.350,spk_0,"points, the only other points, I need to mention --"
p5,00:10:09.350,00:10:29.960,spk_3,"That's a slightly separate point, and then they were clearly resisting the arbitration clause. But, I mean, it's equally clear that they were prepared for one reason or another. And maybe on an entirely false basis, historically, to assert that they were parties to an agreement, had been or had become."
p5,00:10:31.440,00:10:50.140,spk_0,"Well, My Lord, the difficulty with that is that if one looks at paragraphs 2 and 14 of that plaint of 1998, the basis upon which the government was willing to take that position was succession or alter ego. And those are bases which Dallah has now abandoned."
p5,00:10:50.540,00:10:58.480,spk_3,"Well, it doesn't much matter. I mean, if the whole idea of common intention seems to be quite"

p5,00:11:00.430,00:11:43.740,spk_3,"elusive or it seems to me that obviously, if we're asking ourselves, Does this show that at the time when the contract was alive during the trust, during the trust life, does it show that the government of Pakistan was a party to the government contract. The answer, I think you'd give would be no, because of paragraphs 2 and 14. All they're asserting is that they somehow became a party. But if that is the relevant moment, then one might find an intention in that six month period."
p5,00:11:44.250,00:12:15.790,spk_2,"If there was a common, I know this is contrary to your case, if there was a common intention in that six month period, so that during that six month period, assuming there's never been a common intention up till -- up till then. But in that common, if contrary to your case on the facts that were held that there was a common intention that the government should be a party to the contract and thus to the arbitration clause since no line really been drawn between being a party to the contract and a party to the arbitration agreement, then that would be enough for French law."
p5,00:12:15.910,00:12:29.400,spk_0,"Can I ask that two ways? Firstly, all of this probably makes no difference, but the main point is no. And the reason for that is this court has not had the benefit of the live testimony on the French test, which Mr Justice Akins -- you can"

p5,00:13:12.530,00:13:20.030,spk_0,"Exactly, but that's what we're talking about. Here is a question of fact. We're talking about applying the French test reasonably to these flights, but"

p5,00:13:31.440,00:13:34.090,spk_3,"But the substantive point,"

p5,00:13:34.780,00:14:13.250,spk_3,"point you're making here is that everybody has approached the arbitration agreement, including the tribunal as a -- an autonomous separate agreements. And so the question to ask is not where the government of Pakistan accepting that they were at some stage party to the, the main agreement, the actual contract. But were they actually accepting an obligation to arbitrate? And the one thing that's clear in the 1998 proceedings is that they were, denying that, isn't it? I think"

p5,00:14:18.200,00:14:19.230,spk_2,that although they were
p5,00:14:19.230,00:14:34.970,spk_3,"accepting that they were a party to the main contract, they were also saying, probably [inaudible] in English common law, running right, that there had ceased to be any contractual relationship as a"

p5,00:14:54.380,00:15:19.200,spk_0,"then happens is that the position becomes a little bit more clear as a matter of logic when they then withdraw this proceeding and start the 1999 proceedings. And what then happens in the 99 proceedings finally, is Dallah says you can't bring them. You've got no locus standi because you're saying you're not a party to the arbitration. Remember, 99 proceedings are under the arbitration at 1940. Pakistan"
p5,00:15:19.210,00:15:19.630,spk_1,Section
p5,00:15:19.630,00:15:57.960,spk_0,"33 says you've got no right to seek any relief in relation to the arbitration because you are not a party, and the Pakistan court agrees. That's what happened in the 99 proceedings. One thing I should mention along the way again, we'll leave the facts in a moment because they're probably all of this is once looking at individual points in a continuum. But at the same time, the court must not lose sight of the fact that Dallah is, the Governor of Pakistan is making its position crystal clear in the arbitration itself. It's not a party while the 1998 proceedings are on foot. So I couldn't look at the 1998 proceedings without also taking into account what they were saying to the alleged tribunal."
p5,00:15:57.970,00:16:03.950,spk_1,The way the Court of Appeal put it in paragraph 41 is that the French

p5,00:16:34.030,00:16:47.460,spk_0,"Appeal. It is, it is. That's my only point in stressing the rest of the Pakistan proceedings is to do is to urge this court not to upset what the Court of Appeal has found, which is that the French -- there's no reason to upset that the French test looks at a continuum."

I simply don't believe the French law doesn't have an arrangement whereby you can -- you can have a change in the course of the continue. Of course, of course, you can. They obviously recognise that you could. They could have formed an attention halfway through which they didn't have to begin with. Of course. You'd have to be able to find that. And of course, the other side would also have to agree before you had an agreement. Absolutely. But the critical point of mine is in paragraph 122 is the judge's point. He says he isn't so much saying, Well, if you look at the original MOU so if you look at the original agreement that they obviously weren't a party and that's it, what he's saying is, when you look at the whole thing and including what happened after that and, critically, you have to look at what happened not only in the 1998 proceedings.

I didn't mean to say it was rigid, but if I may say Your Lordship is completely summarised the point to make the continuum is simply you look at everything reasonably and in my submission. What the tribunal did was they looked at 1998 but they didn't look at the 97 proceedings, and they didn't look at the 99 proceedings."
p5,00:26:30.040,00:26:40.950,spk_4,"Well, I have great difficulty in working out what the tribunal really decided on this point. But one thing is clear. It didn't apply anything resembling the French test."

When I come last year to transnational law, this is a point that needs to be clarified because I must say there's a bit of sensitivity in the outside world about this, but they did not. They did not apply the French law test as it was expounded before Mr Justice Atkins. But"
p5,00:26:58.530,00:27:04.100,spk_4,"it seems to me they did, as while rejecting the alter ego theory. In fact --"
p5,00:27:04.110,00:27:04.900,spk_0,they applied it --
p5,00:27:04.920,00:27:05.780,spk_4,really applied. And the
p5,00:27:05.780,00:27:25.550,spk_0,"reason they applied it is because they applied a wider rules of law, open ended transnational approach, which is different from French law, where you can look at many different things, whether it's Lexmark, Vitoria or [inaudible]. They applied a bit of Dow Chemical Group of companies a bit of alter ego, a bit of common intention to get a good faith."

p5,00:28:03.070,00:28:16.880,spk_3,Internal page 25. I think that those first two paragraph's are saying we can't accept the alter ego principle by looking at the rules and regulations without
p5,00:28:16.880,00:28:17.650,spk_0,more.
p5,00:28:17.660,00:29:09.480,spk_3,"Because the first paragraph is dealing the rules and regulations on their face create a separate legal entity and the rules relating to the board of trustees and the control is not in itself sufficiently pertinent to impair the distinct legal personality. So that's the starting point. But then they go on and examine a huge range of other activities, as I see it in paragraph 12.1, page 34 Internal numbers. The first power of actually is an acceptance of the alter ego. It is possible. It is categorically it is. And that is reiterated in the penultimate paragraph of this on page 35 admittedly only in the through the eyes of the chairman, who's saying he is comforted by other things to think it's the alter ego."

p5,00:29:23.180,00:29:24.520,spk_3,I think that getting that
p5,00:29:24.530,00:29:27.200,spk_0,they're getting it with an amalgam with alter ego.
p5,00:29:28.190,00:29:31.810,spk_3,They're getting alter ego from elements of common intention. Exactly.
p5,00:29:31.820,00:29:39.750,spk_0,It's a complete medley of principles which may be open to them as a matter of transnational law but not French law.

But in one of the articles that my learned friend cited at the beginning of her presentation from the [inaudible], which has come out recently, there two articles that came out on the Court of Appeal judgment. There is a misconception that the English court is being overly English, and it is putting forward a conception of French law that excludes transnational law, whereas French lawyers believe that their law includes transnational law elements. Now when I come to this, I'm going to explain, it's a very easy answer to that. But if you allow me to park that, to deal with at that point, so where I think there's sensitivity is that the outside world needs to understand that the Court of Appeal and Mr Justice Akins were doing exactly the same as the French court would have done. They were not being anti French or anti trans national law, But it all has to be seen through the prism of French law. I'm gonna I'll come to that if I may. I"

p5,00:31:29.050,00:31:38.990,spk_0,"Yes, there are there, I have to be. In fairness, there are common intention points in this. But what's difficult about the award in my submission is that the,"

p5,00:31:40.040,00:32:33.560,spk_0,"the tribunal said that it was an accumulation of facts. So for them, the individual points in time were not enough. My learned friend relies upon the letter of termination and the latter part of the technology, but that wasn't enough for the tribunal. They said you had to read it altogether, but what did they read together? They read together a misconception of the previous facts, plus alter ego elements which have been abandoned. So if you strip away the parts of the tribunal's award that really are not admissible anymore or permissible. You're not left with enough for the result. And if you put on top of that, Lord Mustill's hesitation, he says, It's close to the line this confusion about good faith, which the chairman Mr Mahmassani uses to bolster to comfort his analysis. This is an award which, actually upon scrutiny, taking away alter ego and succession is not sustainable."
p5,00:32:34.040,00:32:53.460,spk_1,"Going back to page 422, I'm looking at paragraph 13, just to see how this all fits in. There is a reference there to looking at the elements globally as a whole. So to that extent, the French approache is being adopted is it."
p5,00:32:53.460,00:33:06.800,spk_0,"Yes, there are. There is a coincidence of features between the French test and what the tribunal did for sure. The problem is, it's not the same. They do things which the French court would do. But it's not the same tests they're applying. What's"
p5,00:33:06.800,00:33:24.140,spk_2,"also unclear is which bits are just Dr Mahmassani, in which bits are the others. For example, the second paragraph of paragraph 13 seems to be Dr Mahmassani, and then paragraph 14,"
p5,00:33:24.510,00:33:24.800,spk_3,is
p5,00:33:24.800,00:33:27.260,spk_2,that that's all Dr Mahmassani is it?
p5,00:33:28.330,00:33:36.190,spk_0,"Yes, paragraph 14 seems to be because you then get to the bottom of the following page, and you have Dr Schar and Lord Mustill's view."
p5,00:33:37.040,00:33:44.870,spk_1,"Well, it's quite clear that the contrast between the top of page 35 the bottom because we've got Dr Mahmassani first three paragraph's"

p5,00:34:00.590,00:35:28.640,spk_0,"And what's also curious, My Lords, if I may be back to page 20 internal page 20 of the award, paragraph 3 when the when. The When the tribunal articulates the principles that they're going to apply, they talk about in paragraph 3, rules of law. They say judicial as well as arbitral case law. Now arbitral case law is a shorthand for Dow Chemical. In my submission, the Dow Chemical I don't know if Your Lordships are familiar with it, but it is an ICC arbitral award that has given rise to what's been called arbitral case law on something called the Groups of Company doctrine, which has come before the English courts occasionally and been roundly rejected. But arbitral case law is not French law. Previous decisions of arbitrators, they say here, arbitral case law now clearly recognise that as a result of the principle of autonomy, the rules of law applicable to an arbitration agreement may differ, then just is a reference to delay echo. And then it says 300 bottom may consist of transnational general principles, which the arbitrators would consider to meet the fundamental requirements of justice. Then, it says Dr Justice Shar and Lord Mustill would not endorse without reservation the concept of a transnational procedural law independent of all national laws. They need not, however, pursue this, since it makes no difference to the results now in my submission, that's difficult to understand. Why does it make no difference to the result?"

p5,00:35:35.160,00:35:42.970,spk_4,seems to suggest that they're reserving the position on whether translate there's a transnational procedural law.
p5,00:35:44.640,00:36:01.160,spk_0,"But if I'm not sure what the distinction is here between a transnational procedural law and a transnational substantive law, the only thing they appear to be applying are transnational transnational principles. To answer the question, who is a party to the agreement,"

p5,00:36:10.330,00:36:14.650,spk_0,If it's not that because the only question that they're investing is who's a party to the agreement?

And that when we get to later as a starting point, to make a distinction between French law and transnational law, where this gets complicated is I have to, with your permission explain a little bit more about the content of French law because it does have so called transnational elements, and that's where the sensitivity is."
p5,00:37:14.940,00:37:31.720,spk_1,"So is that what they're saying in paragraph 420? Yes.

p5,00:37:33.920,00:37:35.050,spk_0,The point
p5,00:37:35.050,00:37:39.670,spk_2,"that this only applies to the arbitration agreement that all these doctrines that do not apply to the substantive,"
p5,00:37:40.330,00:37:43.940,spk_0,"substantive agreement, according to the tribunal, was governed by Saudi Arabian law."
p5,00:37:43.950,00:37:47.450,spk_2,"How do they arrive at that, I mean, why do you apply different criteria to these?"
p5,00:37:47.450,00:38:21.180,spk_0,"Because the French or in arbitrators sitting in France, they are entitled by conflicts of law to treat the arbitration agreement as governed by transnational principles. Because of the nature of the arbitration agreement. It is an agreement which has validity by reference to a transnational legal order different from other contracts. Yeah, that's a that's a conception of arbitration that we do not have in England, but they do have in in some civil law countries. So there are French rules which allow them to do that for the arbitration clause."
p5,00:38:21.470,00:38:55.910,spk_3,"The first thing they're saying is that contrary to what the parties were apparently basing themselves on, you distinguish between the arbitration clause and the main agreement. Yes, and then the second thing is that you distinguish between the law governing the arbitration clause and the procedural law which will govern the arbitration. It's it's the latter which Lord Mustill and Dr Schar question whether it can be governed by transnational law. The former they seem to accept can be,"
p5,00:38:55.960,00:39:06.000,spk_0,"I imagine that's right. But of course, this is the first partial award is only concerned with the question, who is a party to the arbitration agreement? So,"

p5,00:39:11.460,00:39:18.220,spk_0,"They deal with the second part of the world. They deal with the substantive governing law of the main contract, which they find a Saudi Arabian law."
p5,00:39:18.230,00:39:20.310,spk_3,And when do they decide what procedural law?
p5,00:39:20.320,00:39:30.920,spk_0,"I'm not sure I'll be corrected. I'm not sure there's an express finding on that, but I suspect that the the moment I don't recall a finding on that."
p5,00:39:31.170,00:39:42.650,spk_3,They all seem to be agreed that the arbitration agreement or a question whether there is an arbitration agreement is detached from any national law and is subject to some transnational law. Yes.

p5,00:39:48.310,00:39:57.650,spk_2,"and that's because of the ICC clause, or is it the fact that the arbitrations are taking place in France? If it were an ICC arbitration taking place in London?"

p5,00:40:14.990,00:40:23.380,spk_0,Well forgive me. The point where on is is what what is different than I asked. What
p5,00:40:23.380,00:40:26.160,spk_3,is it that decides whether this can be subject --
p5,00:40:26.170,00:40:27.430,spk_0,to a transnational?

p5,00:40:44.200,00:40:48.040,spk_0,That's the framework for the tribunal to decide on what law governs.

p5,00:41:04.620,00:41:47.670,spk_0,"get from that French arbitration law, the equivalent of R 96 act, which sets up the structure for the arbitration. The procedure plus the ICC rules by agreement. So you read those two documents together. That is the governing structure. Article 64 of the ICC rules allow gives a choice of law sets up the choice of law principles for the ICC arbitrators. They have flexibility under the rules to apply rules of law, as well as law. And"

p5,00:42:06.640,00:42:29.930,spk_0,"in common usage in international arbitration, I'll show you these references later. They come up because it's relevant in understanding your convention. There's a debate between law and rules of law in all on central documents, a debate that featured in the model law it featured in the 1996 act. So in, in across all these different systems, law is treated as being different from rules of law."
p5,00:42:32.400,00:42:35.390,spk_2,"Well, just give an example of law as opposed to a rule of law."
p5,00:42:35.390,00:42:56.300,spk_0,Law would be English law. Rule of law might be the International Sale of Goods Convention. It's not one national legal system. It's just an international legal principle. This is all set out in the written case by reference to the model law and the commentaries

p5,00:49:19.620,00:49:23.270,spk_2,-- really relevant to the true construction of the arbitration reasons.
p5,00:49:25.630,00:50:06.850,spk_0,"When we got to this, because we were looking at trying to understand the tribunal's award. Can I with your permission can I just wind back to that point? Where we end up is that in my submission, what the tribunal has done is they have applied transnational rules, not French law, and they have conducted an exercise. The important this is the important point. They've conducted an exercise which is not open to a court under Article five of the New York Convention. It may be open to the tribunal sitting in France as arbitrators, but it is not open under the conflict of law rules in Article 5(1)(a) of the New York convention and equally section 1032"
p5,00:50:06.850,00:50:08.080,spk_4,of
p5,00:50:08.080,00:50:14.100,spk_0,the 1996 act. That's the that's the point to take away from this now. Would
p5,00:50:14.100,00:50:24.120,spk_2,"that be true in France? But if they try to enforce in France, which happened to be the seat of the object -- yes -- they they would have to play Article 5(1)(a) wouldn't they?"
p5,00:50:25.130,00:50:38.240,spk_0,Because Article 5(1)(a) is only for foreign awards. They would have to apply the French Civil Procedure Code to enforce a domestic award. If 5(1)(a) is only for foreign awards incoming awards under the New York
p5,00:50:38.240,00:50:38.860,spk_2,convention.
p5,00:50:39.360,00:51:34.480,spk_0,"So the equivalent in England is If you have a London seat, somebody can come to the commercial court to enforce, not in your convention. That would be Section 66 of the 1996 act. It's a domestic process. As it happens. Can I make this point by where verbal footnote only as it happens, if you go to France with a French award, they will do exactly the same thing as they do under in your convention. They will apply French law to this question of initial consent, and the case on that is SPP Pyramids. That was a French enforcement. There's a very famous case we keep mentioning. It's an instance of the enforcement of a French award in France applying French law where the tribunal applied a very similar set of principles as this tribunal is done to attach it, to make a government a party that was not a signatory. And when the French court reviewed it at enforcement stage, they applied French law."
p5,00:51:34.760,00:51:35.990,spk_3,A French award?
p5,00:51:36.290,00:51:49.820,spk_0,"Was a French award. They applied French law and the Orri test that I've shown you. And it's the same evidence has been, it's the same thing they would do under the New York convention. And that was a footnote to just explain what would happen in France."
p5,00:51:50.660,00:51:51.680,spk_4,So.
p5,00:51:54.100,00:51:59.350,spk_2,"And when they reply, if you if your clients are applied to set aside the award in France, they would apply the same thing."
p5,00:51:59.410,00:52:00.180,spk_0,The same test.
p5,00:52:01.550,00:52:09.410,spk_2,"So they apply the same test if your clients applied to set aside the test, or indeed, if they want to do it, the other side tried to enforce the award in France. Same test."
p5,00:52:10.230,00:52:20.820,spk_4,"If here if English if a tribunal an ICC tribunal sitting in London applied transnational rules, what would happen here? The question"
p5,00:52:20.830,00:52:49.580,spk_0,"would be, and under said it would be tested by Section 46 of the English Arbitration ACT. Section 46 of the Arbitration Act sets out the rules, which the tribunal is allowed to apply to matters of substance. Section 46 says of course, this is instead of the prevention. Section 46 says."

p5,00:54:09.240,00:54:22.760,spk_3,"that actually isn't the issue before them because, I mean, that hasn't been submitted by any agreement to them. It's just as if they're deciding whether there's an arbitration clause at all. Yes. You have to find some"

So here, if the chosen Saudi law -- yes -- to apply to the substance, that wouldn't affect necessarily the governing law of the arbitration agreement. So what happens under the act if they they have chosen the law to govern the substance of the agreement? Sorry, there is a choice of law in the agreement as there was here, but there is a dispute as to whether a party is a is a party to the arbitration agreement. And then the arbitrators apply transnational rules of law to determine"
p5,00:55:09.730,00:55:18.080,spk_0,"the English court would not do the same. The English court would apply just law to that. But I know I'm thinking on my feet. I'm afraid, My Lords."
p5,00:55:18.610,00:55:20.860,spk_1,Are still under Section 46.
p5,00:55:20.880,00:55:47.230,spk_0,"At this point, we wouldn't be, we wouldn't be. My Lord, My Lord, Lord Collin's is absolutely right. Because actually, Section 46 is the equivalent Article 28 of the model law, which is which is it is if you allow me to backtrack a few steps. That is the substance of the dispute. As referred not so we're distinguishing here between the law governing the substantive contract and the law governing arbitration agreement. Law governing arbitration agreement would not be within Section 46."
p5,00:55:47.240,00:55:49.790,spk_4,Just assumed this had happened in
p5,00:55:50.010,00:57:15.770,spk_0,"this case that happened in London. In my submission, the English court would restrict itself to English law as the law. It would ask itself, first of all, what law governs the arbitration agreement. That would be the first question of the analysis, because it's the law governing the arbitration agreement that will dictate to other parties like any contract putative law that's step one. Step two, you apply a conflicts principle to establish what law governs the arbitration agreement. The conflicts rule in England is after the court, the Court of Appeal in C versus D. Then unless there's any express indication it will be the law of the seat as the closest connecting factor. The only other competing factor might be the law governing the substantive contract in which the arbitration clause is placed. So can I, just to summarise my point, because I was on a false track before the question is who is part of the arbitration agreement? Answer depends on the law governing arbitration agreement. What law governs the arbitration agreement? As a matter of English conflicts, it will be either the law, the law most closely connected, which will either be the law of the putative seat. Or if there's some other reason you would look to the law governing the substantive contract after C versus D. The emphasis in England now is the law of the seat, which is a new thing. So the English court would then say, if the putative seat is England,"
p5,00:57:15.780,00:57:19.280,spk_2,that was that was a case where the Bermuda or somewhere.
p5,00:57:20.230,00:57:22.790,spk_0,"Yes and it was a case of, they"

p5,00:57:27.000,00:57:52.990,spk_0,"And C versus D comes after a line of cases in the English courts where traditionally, the English court would actually look to the law governing the main contract. Sumitomo Mr Justice [inaudible] was 1994 and a line of cases before that in the English courts used to say the most. The fact with the closest connection to be the law covering the main contract because this is just a clause in the contract after C versus D."
p5,00:57:53.600,00:57:59.430,spk_2,C versus Deal was to have an arbitration in Bermuda and not to be government.

p5,01:00:01.240,01:00:05.900,spk_0,"And then it says, I'll read it out. It says the reason is the agreement to arbitrate will normally have"
p5,01:00:05.900,01:00:06.740,spk_2,a closer
p5,01:00:06.770,01:00:12.320,spk_0,and more real connection with the place where the parties have chosen to arbitrate than the place of the law of the underlying
p5,01:00:12.320,01:00:13.140,spk_3,contract.
p5,01:00:13.500,01:00:26.330,spk_0,In cases where the parties have deliberately chosen to arbitrate in one place disputes which have arisen under a contract governed by the law of another place. So that is a summary of where the courts

p5,01:00:27.540,01:00:33.340,spk_0,not a hard and fast rule. There will be times where you can't look at the seats because it's not being chosen by the parties or there are other factors.
p5,01:00:33.420,01:00:46.230,spk_3,"But this is by reference to Channel Tunnel -- yes -- which is actually dealing with the law governing the conduct of the arbitration, which is the procedural law, which is a different thing from the"
p5,01:00:46.230,01:00:46.940,spk_0,law
p5,01:00:47.510,01:00:49.890,spk_3,governing the question whether there is an arbitration.
p5,01:00:50.090,01:00:53.110,spk_0,My Lord no this is this is about the law governing the arbitration agreement.
p5,01:00:53.480,01:01:00.570,spk_3,"The reasoning seems to transpose the statement from one context to the other. Well, there's"
p5,01:01:01.010,01:01:05.680,spk_4,a very elaborate discussion in Black Clawson isn't there of the different.
p5,01:01:06.910,01:01:47.070,spk_0,"Absolutely  identified I think, six possibly in his mind, 12 different laws that my government arbitration and that was because the Black Clawson he came up with the concept of double severability, which was I'm not sure we need to get to that, but many different elements in the process that might be done by different law for our purposes. My Lords, all the only reason we're talking about this is the question was raised. What if this was in England? If this was in England, the English court would have to find out first what law governs the arbitration agreement. It will apply English conflicts rules. Now this debate about C and D is just an elaboration of what those rules might be."
p5,01:01:48.310,01:01:49.230,spk_3,I see that
p5,01:01:49.240,01:02:02.540,spk_0,"so whatever those rules are and we can spend time on C versus D. But whatever those rules are, the English court will do that exercise, and it will come to a law. And in my submission most likely will be English law in this case, whatever. That's what the English court will do."
p5,01:02:02.610,01:02:03.810,spk_4,"But in France,"
p5,01:02:03.860,01:02:07.870,spk_0,"in France they will apply a different process, and that I can now explain,"
p5,01:02:08.210,01:02:19.690,spk_2,"could come to transnational principles, could not be applied the law of the seat and the law of the seat was, say, France, which itself applied transition principles."
p5,01:02:19.960,01:02:39.070,spk_0,"That gets into a very complicated point at that point that that would be applying, not the law of the place of arbitration, it's substantive law. But that would be include some sort of wrong. Presumably where you would say, Well, do what they would do in France, which and in France they would do something else. But I'm not sure we need to get into this."
p5,01:02:39.310,01:02:51.410,spk_1,"It does depend very much talking about remember very well, Whitworth Miller against Whitworth. The arbitration agreement was with reference to -- yes -- the arbitration was conducted in Scotland,"

p5,01:04:09.370,01:04:09.880,spk_1,That's encouraging.
p5,01:04:09.890,01:04:26.780,spk_0,"Can I? At this point, the most efficient thing for me to do with your permission is to change my proposed course, which I gave at the beginning and close off transnational law. I was going to deal with it last, but we've dealt with half of it. So I might as well complete it now -- very well -- if that if that's permissible. But"
p5,01:04:26.780,01:04:29.020,spk_1,"I think I think we can go ahead that way. Yes,"
p5,01:04:29.030,01:04:43.680,spk_0,"because because the issue we're on now is comes to what does it mean? in Article 5 (1) (a), when it says the law of the country where the arbitration award was made, or the seat of it,.That's what I needed, just a complete on this on this point."
p5,01:04:43.710,01:04:44.200,spk_1,All right.
p5,01:04:44.860,01:04:50.450,spk_0,"And then after that, the only thing left for me to do I say only, is the nature of the court's examination."
p5,01:04:50.450,01:04:50.770,spk_1,Yes.
p5,01:04:51.580,01:05:03.720,spk_3,"I mean, this may not arise, but if one had a situation where the English court was required to apply or evaluate transnational law,"
p5,01:05:04.590,01:05:04.800,spk_4,is
p5,01:05:04.800,01:05:07.230,spk_3,there any way in which one could do that?
p5,01:05:07.700,01:05:08.090,spk_0,By
p5,01:05:08.090,01:05:09.300,spk_3,"definition, it's not law."
p5,01:05:09.390,01:06:23.380,spk_0,"This is well, it's always referred to as Lord Diplocks dicta in [inaudible] Rashid, as interpreted most recently by David Richards QC sitting as a deputy in the Musawi case, that is mentioned in my written case, and it's in the materials. That was the Musawi case, which was about two or three years ago, was a decision involving the application of Sharia law. Sharia law is not a law as through English eyes, it's a set of principles. It will come under the rubric rules of law, but not law and citing Diplock in [inaudible] Rashid, David Richards QC concluded that the English court cannot apply transnational principles, transnational rules absent an agreement, it can do so if that is the express agreement of the parties. I'm now making a submission to, as with all my other points, but particularly this to a bench that comprises people who will correct me on these points. I hope that is, but that is, that is the position at the moment."
p5,01:06:23.390,01:06:25.450,spk_3,"Once you've got an agreement, you've got a contract."
p5,01:06:25.610,01:07:05.800,spk_0,"Then you can do that and of course, we all know famous oil concession contracts that mention national laws plus international principles insofar as they differ. There are many, many soft law options, but they're all by agreement. That is the same policy that is in Section 46 of the Arbitration Act, which I showed you before Section 46 says the law, but if the parties agree, you can agree to other things like Lexmark Victoria, you need to our principles ex quo et bono, amiable composition all these other soft law options. Absent express agreement, the courts will apply the law of a nation state."
p5,01:07:08.780,01:07:19.790,spk_4,"Is there any material in the bundles of transnational rules being applied as they were in this case, to question whether someone is bound by an arbitration agreement."
p5,01:07:20.180,01:07:48.300,spk_0,"No, the closest that we have and we have a lot of it is the French law conception, which I'm coming to now of transnational law. Okay, this sounds convoluted, but I'm going to endeavour to make this clear. That's all, in terms of courts. Well, Mr [inaudible]  was mentioning Dow Chemical, but this is not a court decision. That's a tribunal decision for court decisions. The answer is no."
p5,01:07:48.680,01:07:56.480,spk_1,"But does it come to this? As far as we can see, there is no express agreement in this case, that transnational law should be"
p5,01:07:56.480,01:07:57.860,spk_0,applied. Correct. In
p5,01:07:57.860,01:08:06.080,spk_1,"fact, each side were arguing for a different position about a different system of law so that that's a point, that part of your argument."
p5,01:08:07.270,01:08:24.490,spk_0,"Now, if things sounded complex, they are just about to get more complex. If I may say because I now need to deal with French law, what is French law and why is it different from, how does it differ from transnational law? [Background noise]."

p5,01:08:33.720,01:08:48.020,spk_0,"will recall that the tribunal mentioned the [inaudible]  case, which My Lord Lord Mance has just referred to. And it did so on the basis that as a matter of French law,"
p5,01:08:48.040,01:08:49.170,spk_3,you
p5,01:08:49.170,01:08:53.680,spk_0,do not have to apply a national law to an arbitration agreement.
p5,01:08:55.109,01:08:58.500,spk_1,The rules sorry need to be linked to a particular national.
p5,01:08:58.500,01:09:07.779,spk_0,"Exactly, the rules meaning the way in which you interpret through an arbitration agreement do not need to be tied to a national law."
p5,01:09:07.790,01:09:10.560,spk_1,Yes so it's quite clear the talking about principles.
p5,01:09:10.569,01:09:11.180,spk_0,"Yes,"
p5,01:09:12.270,01:09:12.670,spk_3,there
p5,01:09:12.680,01:09:16.500,spk_0,is a key distinction here between three
p5,01:09:16.609,01:09:17.700,spk_1,categories.
p5,01:09:17.870,01:10:02.880,spk_0,"Number one, French law. That is the law that will be applied by French courts, absent any other agreement. Number two, the conflicts rules that apply to arbitrators sitting in France. What are they allowed to do? Number three, general transnational law that arbitrators may be able to apply sitting in France by virtue of number two, the conflicts"
p5,01:10:02.880,01:10:03.280,spk_4,rules.
p5,01:10:06.160,01:10:55.770,spk_0,"That is the clear, that's the very important distinction in order to understand this area. So the first category is French law, as applied by French court's. Categories two and three is about French arbitrators or arbitrators sitting in France. We shouldn't be concerned with two and three because for your purposes you've got to understand you've got to apply French law under Article 5(1)(a) of the New York convention. You'll recall that whether you need to turn that up again, but that's a uniform conflicts rule in the convention. Maybe it's worth just starting from that point again. Bundle, the authorities bundle 1 of your convention, tab 12. This, of course, is the same wording at the 1996"
p5,01:10:55.780,01:11:07.940,spk_3,act. You haven't got a spare copy of this convention?
p5,01:11:08.200,01:11:08.970,spk_1,I've

p5,01:11:29.560,01:11:36.170,spk_0,"So I'm going to make observations later at the end of this about why this was, in fact, it doesn't say rules of"
p5,01:11:36.170,01:11:37.770,spk_2,law. At
p5,01:11:37.780,01:11:40.740,spk_0,"the moment. We are dealing with the expression, law of the"

p5,01:11:42.270,01:11:46.870,spk_0,"Under the law of the country where the award was made, that's the test for this court."
p5,01:11:48.370,01:11:50.220,spk_2,"And that's a geographical. Yes,"
p5,01:11:50.230,01:11:51.060,spk_0,we'll talk
p5,01:11:51.100,01:11:52.340,spk_2,about seat or a
p5,01:11:52.350,01:12:49.150,spk_0,"seat. Its seat. It's got to be understood. A seat. Otherwise it would be totally random because you would make the awarding this is [inaudible] . Remember the case where, it was a member of my chambers, who signed Bob McDonnell, signed the award in Paris, incidentally, and it changed. So its seat, that's the that's the test we are applying doesn't say rules of law. So here it's common ground, it's French law. My submission on this is that that means, as interpreted by Mr Justice Atkins and the Court of Appeal, the law that would be applied by a French court. It's not the law or rules of law that might be applied by an arbitrator sitting in France. That's different. Now do"
p5,01:12:49.150,01:12:51.350,spk_1,"you get that simply out of the language,"

p5,01:12:56.950,01:13:00.690,spk_2,"applied by a French court? What, to a substantive question?"
p5,01:13:00.750,01:13:02.200,spk_0,To this to this question?
p5,01:13:02.210,01:13:03.010,spk_2,Namely where there was a

p5,01:13:05.000,01:13:12.230,spk_2,"There was a bad opposition, no room for principles of French private international law and the ending of that kind."
p5,01:13:12.260,01:13:59.880,spk_0,"It's not got a [inaudible]  in it. And the this was supposed to be Albert Jan van den Berg makes this point. I'll get to the reference in a minute. This was supposed to be in 1958 when the convention was drafted, a uniform conflicts rule, meaning it would not have wronged by in it. It would be a rule, a simple rule applied in all contracting states. And the policy behind it is pretty obvious in my submission. If you are going to have an arbitration agreement tested, you test it by it's the place where, where the legal seat of the arbitration being the closest connecting place collected place. That's the conflicts rule that they decided on."

p5,01:14:47.420,01:14:49.660,spk_0,Yes. Then what?

p5,01:14:52.780,01:14:54.320,spk_0,got a law indicated so
p5,01:14:54.320,01:14:56.560,spk_2,that would be the Lord in which the parties have subjected to it.
p5,01:14:57.040,01:14:57.830,spk_0,"Yes, the"
p5,01:14:57.830,01:14:59.370,spk_2,"putative parties have suggested,"
p5,01:15:00.240,01:15:02.830,spk_1,but that would be the law of the country X.
p5,01:15:02.840,01:15:03.450,spk_0,"Yes,"
p5,01:15:04.940,01:15:31.720,spk_3,"basically, I mean, the logical consequence of this ought to be that arbitrators who must have in mind that they are producing awards which are intended to be enforced under the New York convention, ought actually to adopt as the law governing the question whether an agreement is valid or not. The law of the seat."
p5,01:15:31.880,01:15:34.030,spk_0,Yes.
p5,01:15:34.030,01:15:34.680,spk_3,But they don't.
p5,01:15:34.690,01:15:35.670,spk_0,Well.
p5,01:15:35.940,01:15:37.050,spk_3,They detach themselves.
p5,01:15:37.050,01:16:14.820,spk_0,"There are arbitrators who had take different views about transnational ability and the application of transnational rules. The English policy on this, as reflected in Section 46 of the 1996 act, is arbitrators should not overstep the mark. They must apply law, not rules of law or transnational law, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise. So it's looking through English eyes, for what it's worth, the answer to My Lord Mance's question is yes. An arbitral tribunal should have one eye on where likely recognition and enforcement may be and not do something which is going to invalidate the award under the convention. You know,"
p5,01:16:14.820,01:16:23.740,spk_2,"they, they should look at the arbitration agreement. Yes. One, see whether it's governed by some law if it is applied. Yes. If it isn't, then apply the law of the seat."
p5,01:16:24.330,01:16:39.290,spk_0,"Apply yes or exactly. I mean, there's a golden rule in arbitration, which is you. Look at the end result and work backwards. You've got to do whatever you do must not impunity award under the convention because that's the end result. Article five has a normative way."
p5,01:16:39.400,01:16:44.250,spk_2,The whole point of an arbitration is that it should be the award should be enforceable under the convention.
p5,01:16:44.250,01:17:03.120,spk_0,"Exactly, and that's the beauty of it. The convention is not a constraint, it is an advantage. But Article 5 of the convention has a normative value. It spreads back through the process. Everything that happens in the arbitration must conform with those minimum standards. And if you do conform, you have the advantage of international enforcement."
p5,01:17:03.830,01:17:20.940,spk_3,"But the trouble with the difficulty, or perhaps one can sympathise to some extent with arbitrators in this late is that the Court of Cassation itself has invaded arbitrators sitting in France to detach themselves from any state law."
p5,01:17:20.950,01:17:52.640,spk_0,"I'm grateful because that's exactly what I need to go now. I've given you the three structure, the structure of three elements. French law, conflicts for arbitrators, what arbitrators might do. Now I need to explain the first one. What is French law? What does record a [inaudible] about the content of French law? If I've made that clear, can I now answer that point? This goes to the heart of the transnational issue the French court. We've gone through what an English court would do, which would be applying a conflicts of law analysis. The French court would not do the same."
p5,01:17:53.330,01:17:53.530,spk_3,The
p5,01:17:53.530,01:19:03.590,spk_0,"French courts do not apply a conflicts of law analysis to the question of who is a party to an arbitration agreement or its validity. They have developed what in France is called a [inaudible] a substantive rule material rule which the courts in France apply instead of going through a conflicts of law analysis. The origin of this substantive material rule is a transnational rule, a rule of international public policy and many other international norms. That's its origin. But the French and the French courts are proud of that, and that's why there's some sensitivity about this decision. They like to say, as they have done in Dallah Co. The  Dallah Co is the main case on this, which is the one cited by the tribunal. They like to say we respect arbitration agreements as being above the level of national legal orders. They are special transnational agreements. We will test their validity by the French conception of international public policy."

This is what they did in SPP pyramids. It's what they did in Dallah Co. They're not applying conflict. This is just for arbitration rules. They're not applying a conflicts of law analysis, so they apply their substantive rule. They do so using the language of transnational law. I mean, to put it bluntly, if I may, this is perceived as a sort of selling future of international. It's perceived as a sort of selling feature"

In that view, this is the guy, our professor guy, our perception of international arbitration amongst many others now the key point about this process, which I'm going to show you an authority, several authorities on this in a minute. The key point is, whilst it is called a transnational rule in France, by the French court and whilst, as in Dalek, oh, they articulated in terms of being divorced from every national legal system. As a matter of analysis, it is French law. It's not a transnational law principle because it's a transnational principal transnational law principle that has been recognised, adopted and evolved by the French courts."
p5,01:20:34.990,01:20:37.140,spk_4,And it's not a French conflict rule.
p5,01:20:37.150,01:20:51.910,spk_0,"No, it's not a French conflicts rule. It is a rule of French law, and volume B one is the law on it, which is French law. These are the French cases that we've been looking at Orri,"

p5,01:21:09.110,01:21:44.120,spk_0,"French courts adopted this idea of not using conflicts, going straight to what they say is transnational law to test the validity of an arbitration agreement. Since then, that principle has been refined and developed by the French courts. And that's why what in volume be one. You've got a number of French decisions showing how the rule has been developed by the French courts. The French may still call this transnational law. Analytically it is French law."
p5,01:21:44.730,01:21:47.240,spk_2,Does Justice Atkin's expressly hold all that?

p5,01:22:25.670,01:22:33.750,spk_0,You distinguish them by looking at how the French courts have evolved the rule. You distinguish them by looking at the expert evidence. I see.

p5,01:24:05.010,01:24:11.630,spk_4,so. But he says these principles must be regarded as French conflict of laws rules. You don't accept that.
p5,01:24:11.640,01:24:15.130,spk_0,No I think there may have been some slip if I may say with great respect --

p5,01:25:53.430,01:25:54.310,spk_4,and you accept that

p5,01:26:47.620,01:27:02.980,spk_0,"No they accept themselves that this is well, I say they, there are leading commentators, French commentators who say in terms,  even though it's called transnational law it is French law. That's what I'm about to show."

It comprises the cases on which are French law, which are the transnational bit of French law. And those are the cases which were put in evidence before actions by both parties. That is the evidence he decided upon. It is French law, including the French conception of transnational law.

p5,01:31:07.030,01:31:10.010,spk_0,I let me give you a specific example. I
p5,01:31:10.020,01:31:12.660,spk_2,think probably the most important

p5,01:31:13.330,01:31:17.880,spk_2,which we are concerned is this isn't it?
p5,01:31:18.260,01:31:19.200,spk_0,What
p5,01:31:19.200,01:31:25.200,spk_2,parts of the tribunal are different -- yes -- are not part of French Law.
p5,01:31:25.210,01:31:25.750,spk_0,"Yes,"
p5,01:31:27.380,01:31:27.680,spk_2,that's the

p5,01:31:30.510,01:31:32.670,spk_2,I see you have clearly set out --
p5,01:31:32.680,01:31:33.870,spk_0,it's a much easier way into it.
p5,01:31:34.010,01:31:36.340,spk_1,So what? Of course you undertake that?
p5,01:31:36.890,01:31:40.890,spk_0,"Of course I'm going to try and keep, but I'm coming to My Lords point. Yes."
p5,01:31:41.070,01:31:41.570,spk_1,Can
p5,01:31:41.570,01:31:43.530,spk_0,"I show you -- we are going to b,"
p5,01:31:43.660,01:31:44.330,spk_1,going to the
p5,01:31:44.340,01:31:52.610,spk_0,further authorities to make my proposition? That there is a transnational law element in French law is actually French law. Alright.
p5,01:31:52.780,01:31:54.530,spk_1,So we go to the --
p5,01:31:54.540,01:32:03.310,spk_0,"additional authorities, respondents, additional authorities. After that, I will come to My Lord Lord Clark's point as to show how, how what the tribunal did was different?"
p5,01:32:03.320,01:32:13.370,spk_4,"Yes, right. And just one footnote. How do these principles differ from the principles that a French court would apply if this were a holy French case?"
p5,01:32:13.850,01:32:17.870,spk_0,It's the same. It's the same. This is SPP Pyramids.
p5,01:32:19.450,01:32:19.820,spk_3,I
p5,01:32:19.830,01:32:31.320,spk_0,"keep mentioning that case and I'll be guided by the court if you need any elaboration on it. But SPP Pyramids, it's a case which is almost identical, apart from in terms of principles to this case. But"
p5,01:32:31.320,01:32:32.430,spk_4,that wasn't a purely French.
p5,01:32:33.950,01:32:37.840,spk_0,"It was not. No, it's an international arbitration. Yes it's Egypt. What"
p5,01:32:37.840,01:32:50.090,spk_4,"I'm asking is these principles in these cases transnational situations, how do they differ from the principles of the French court would apply in a purely French case?"
p5,01:32:50.850,01:33:09.100,spk_0,"I'm told by Mr [inaudible] you know, if it's a purely French case with no international element, there would be different rules that there are French domestic rules on arbitration. So these are rules of international arbitration."
p5,01:33:09.110,01:33:12.890,spk_4,Which don't rely on the common intention?
p5,01:33:12.890,01:33:15.270,spk_0,The domestic rules? Yes. That I don't know. It's
p5,01:33:15.270,01:33:16.320,spk_4,very likely it's
p5,01:33:16.320,01:33:31.480,spk_0,"unlikely, but it's unlikely it, I suspect that the analysis is different because there's not by reference to transnational legal order, which is the cornerstone of international arbitration in France. But I'm afraid I'm not in a position to help on that. As to the French domestic rules,"
p5,01:33:32.950,01:33:35.230,spk_1,"right, we're going to"
p5,01:33:35.240,01:33:40.750,spk_0,"yes. Can I ask you, first of all, to turn in my bundle of federal authorities to tab 4."
p5,01:33:40.830,01:33:43.170,spk_2,Now these authorities referred to in the case?
p5,01:33:44.350,01:33:48.570,spk_0,"No, they're not because he's the only one that's not referred to."
p5,01:33:49.690,01:33:52.040,spk_1,So this is new material.
p5,01:33:52.600,01:34:29.050,spk_0,"The reason I have sought to introduce it after my [inaudible] case. Right. Is it because of a further the elaboration or further understanding, perhaps, on my part of Dallah's new point before this court, that transnational law is part of French law, and therefore the tribunal applied French law. That's why I've sought to introduce these further authorities. And what I'm doing with these authorities is making good my distinction between French law with that substantive law element law of, and unconstrained transnational law."
p5,01:34:29.640,01:34:31.250,spk_3,So we've got to tab 4 in which bundle?
p5,01:34:31.250,01:34:42.910,spk_0,"In the bundle of respondents, additional. Yes that's what I've got. [Inaudible] Besson is a leading textbook in international arbitration,"

p5,01:34:44.000,01:34:48.110,spk_0,be familiar to some members of the court. There's a heading

p5,01:34:49.890,01:35:00.490,spk_0,"the validity of the arbitration agreement independently of any national law. Now, I don't want to take time reading all of this. Can I point you to the bits that I rely"
p5,01:35:00.490,01:35:01.760,spk_3,upon? This
p5,01:35:01.760,01:35:12.450,spk_0,"is an analysis of the principle in Dallah Co. Remember Dallah Co Court of Cassation decision where they start enunciating this. We do not apply any national law,"
p5,01:35:12.460,01:35:13.590,spk_3,
p5,01:35:13.600,01:35:41.580,spk_0,"picking up from the second paragraph under 180 according to Jean Pierre [inaudible]. Thus was confirmed the principle pursuant to which the validity of an arbitration clause in international contracts resulted solely from the will of the parties independently of any reference to the law of the main contract and to any national law. This is the ultimate pinnacle of autonomy, so that is what the French courts are doing."
p5,01:35:41.590,01:35:59.000,spk_3,"But if it's if it's true that that's what is happening, then, you couldn't possibly fit it within the language of Article 5(1)(a), because you wouldn't be referring to the law of any country."

p5,01:36:17.020,01:36:20.230,spk_3,Exactly.
p5,01:36:20.350,01:37:36.600,spk_0,"And your convention exactly, can continue. Is it not? Rather as [inaudible], Gaia and Goldman noted, the result of a skid of terminology, which probably is an unfortunate translation for it is only the first two aspects ie indifference to the fate of the main contract and the possibility of being submitted to a separate law that flow logically from the principle of separability. The latter, by no means implies that the arbitration agreement is independent of any national law. The real justification of this regime lies elsewhere. As Philippe Bouchard emphasises in his note on the mencucci judgment, the aim is to remove the obstacles which certain laws, including French law, bring to the development of international arbitration. Although the judgment does not say so. This new conception of separability implies abandoning the conflicts of law approach in favour of material rules. Those are the material which I mentioned, which are, in reality, part of French law and not of any international or transnational system. We shall see this point with the delicate judgment. That's the point, the French will call it transnational law because of its origin."
p5,01:37:36.700,01:37:37.450,spk_2,But
p5,01:37:37.450,01:37:39.170,spk_0,"it's French law,"
p5,01:37:39.180,01:37:41.100,spk_1,so it's got nothing to do with conflict.
p5,01:37:41.110,01:37:44.850,spk_0,"No, it's avoiding a conflict approach."
p5,01:37:45.430,01:37:45.750,spk_1,"Yeah,"
p5,01:37:47.130,01:37:48.840,spk_0,the same point is made by
p5,01:37:48.850,01:37:56.170,spk_2,the reason why they're introducing these transnational rules or applying is what to make French arbitration seem particularly international.
p5,01:37:56.180,01:37:56.570,spk_0,"Yes,"
p5,01:37:58.530,01:38:00.450,spk_2,"well, that's not intended to be."
p5,01:38:00.820,01:38:38.950,spk_0,"My answer is, it sounded clear. It's more than that. It's because there is a perfectly respectable French conception of international arbitration. We haven't shared it. Traditionally in this country that the process gets the arbitral process gets validity not from the law of the seat, but from some free floating transnational legal order. That's the French conception. It's set out in detail in Mr Garcia's recent recent book on the philosophy of international arbitration and it's absolutely coherent. We may not share it in this jurisdiction, but it explains the Court of Cassation approach."
p5,01:38:39.140,01:38:45.510,spk_3,"The other explanation seems to be hinted at here, namely, that French domestic law relating to arbitration is pretty technical."
p5,01:38:45.820,01:38:53.440,spk_0,Exactly. That's the other motivation. The other motivations is to avoid the complications and restrictions of French national law.
p5,01:38:53.920,01:39:20.250,spk_1,"So this is an international arbitration principle in effect which has been developed and existed to resolve. The question at the beginning of the paragraph, which is is to to the ability of the clause is to be determined solely from the will of the parties, which is presumably I don't see this written out, but presumably not the way domestic law would look at it for internal laboratory arbitrations"
p5,01:39:20.320,01:39:28.490,spk_4,because I have understood it correctly in delicate was being used to avoid the application of Libyan law as the governing law of the arbitration agreement.
p5,01:39:29.620,01:39:58.590,spk_0,"I think that may be so, but I'm now speaking from memory on delegate. We can look at that and afterwards, but certainly it partly it's detaching from French legal constraints, but importantly the [inaudible] theory is to also detach from the law of the seat. That's the transnational conception of arbitration, that you're not looking at the law of the seat as the source of authority for the process. So if that was outside France, it's the same principle. Well,"
p5,01:39:58.590,01:40:07.490,spk_4,"it was a I think there's a French arbitration but arbitration agreement governed by Libyan law, and they avoided the application of ordinary rules of French private international law. I"

p5,01:40:14.810,01:40:15.210,spk_1,Yes.
p5,01:40:15.220,01:41:03.620,spk_0,"Having recited the case law, which is partly in Bundle b(1), my visual exhibit that was before Akins, can say the result of this case law is that the arbitration agreement is subjected to a material rule in contrast to conflicts principle, which recognises its validity, provided it does not violate international public policy. Although this has been the subject of controversy, the rule is an international rule of French law and not a transnational rule.

Why is it that a French court can somehow itself apply its conception of transnational law in this way arrogating to itself somehow, what international public policy is. My answer to that is, it's not because it's French law. It's the French view of international public policy. The last paragraph on page 3 of this article considered on its own the thesis of the contract entirely outside state law, arises out of well known theoretical objections which, while not irrefutable, need not be revisited. Here, all that is needed is to highlight the curious phenomenon that occurs"

p5,01:42:58.130,01:43:46.260,spk_0,"Yes, indeed such a declaration constitutes the particular reaction of one legal order, which may differ from that of another legal order by virtue of the fact that the arbitration clause included in an international contract is binding on the parties and must be applied irrespective of any law, whether state or otherwise. It is, in fact, a rule of French law that the Court of Appeals states and applies to the clause at the same time, although it reserves the affirmation of the principle of intrinsic validity of the clause to other hypotheses, as we'll see later, such a principle is no less implied."

I believe I'm not going to read all of these, but this is Fukushima [inaudible] making this precise point. They talk, if one starts from internal paragraph 439, beheading is scope and merit of the substantive rules method. My Lords, the substantive rules method is the one which I'm talking about [inaudible] which is avoiding conflicts of law. The idea of going straight to a principal. In paragraphs 439 over to the end of 442 [inaudible] makes the point that this is the French conception of international public policy. It's not international public policy, full stop. It is the French conception of public international public policy. My Lords and I'm going to be conscious of the time, I'm not proposing to read through these paragraphs, but that is My Lord, Lord Park's point is in terms is addressed here because each time [inaudible] talk about international public policy, they do so through the prism of the French courts or the French conception. Why does this all matter? Because under Article 5(1)(a) of in your convention, you are to apply French law. French law includes a substantive material rule."
p5,01:46:39.880,01:47:06.900,spk_1,"It's trying to attract you. It's put very nicely, I think, in paragraph 441, where it said that middle of the paragraph, this understanding of the expression public policy consists of the French legal systems view of the fundamental requirements of justice in an international context. So it's detaching itself from the the domestic view in this particular context, the international context. There's a French conception --"
p5,01:47:08.180,01:47:46.730,spk_0,"exactly, exactly, My Lord. And it's the same point that gets repeated in these other paragraphs at that point. So I'm hoping where I've got to at this point in the analysis is to have made good that we are dealing with two universes. One is the French view of transnational law. That's all French law, and that's all permissible under Article 5(1)(a) in your convention. You've then got this other universe which is not tied to Bundle b(1) and the French cases, It's much more free floating. It's not the French, not through franchise And that is not the law of the country where the award was made."

The best that one can do is to look at the test that the tribunal actually articulated and then point to what may be on a fair view, points that they have missed, which Mrs [inaudible] and  [inaudible] testified on as being French law.

There was no new evidence but the whole point of the three day hearing in front of Mr Justice Atkins was to have detailed analysis of the French test with live testimony from Dr [inaudible]. That was not before the tribunal and that's the point about who is a part of this arbitration. It's what it's the key, essential evidence, whether you call it evidence or submissions. It's French law that was not put before the tribunal. And there's a good reason for that because the case wasn't argued on that basis in front of the tribunal. It was argued as alter ego and succession. The first time the issue of common intent or the French test was raised was after the end of the hearings in the arbitration, in a letter written by the chairman, Mr Mahmassani, to the parties that's noted in the written case, the evidence had finished, the hearings were over.

Conceptual and practical problems raised by the issue of jurisdiction by no means easy in themselves have been made more difficult to solve by the geographical separation of the arbitrator's. The next paragraph is an important one. This leads me to the conceptual aspects of the dispute. The tribunal is of course, clear about the general nature of your client's case, but has, in the course of discussion, become uncertain as to its precise juristic base. In particular, it has struck us that there may be implicit in that case, though not expressly articulated a proposition similar to the one which has been adopted in several awards.

p5,01:57:48.890,01:57:49.650,spk_0,they would be the

p5,01:57:55.920,01:57:58.060,spk_2,anyway? There might be more scope for arguing about that.
p5,01:57:58.440,01:58:58.850,spk_0,"Actually, just when we rolled up in front of Mr Justice Akins, we had a daunting number of files on Pakistani law because they began this case running an alter ego and succession case. When we got to the argument, the hearing Dallah abandoned alter ego and succession and that Article 264 point that is recorded, My Lords in paragraph 58 of Mr Justice Akins judgment and I think from recollection 76 to 77 or thereabouts, he records what happened. What happened was I cross examined  [inaudible]  [inaudible]. Sorry, I cross examined Mr Posada, who was their Pakistani law expert. And then Mr Justice Akins cross examined Mr Posada and the Pakistan Law case on succession of alter ego fell away. Dallah abandoned it. So we're now in different different territory to where the tribunal were."
p5,01:58:59.620,01:59:00.570,spk_3,I

I have to accept that the issue of common intention was open before the tribunal. Because of that letter, they wrote but we don't know how they dealt with it. And when we come back to the point now about was it the French test? You cannot in my submission, make that finding that they applied French transnational."
p5,01:59:26.310,01:59:27.200,spk_2,You gave us
p5,01:59:27.200,01:59:27.730,spk_0,the

p5,01:59:35.240,01:59:37.060,spk_0,points what was at 58
p5,01:59:37.070,01:59:38.070,spk_2,58? 58.
p5,01:59:38.080,01:59:41.730,spk_0,"And also, I think, let me check. I'm doing this"
p5,01:59:41.730,01:59:42.540,spk_2,from memory.
p5,01:59:42.920,01:59:44.470,spk_0,I think it's 76
p5,01:59:44.470,01:59:45.740,spk_2,as
p5,01:59:45.740,01:59:51.130,spk_0,well. Where? 58 records. The points of agreement between the parties and you'll see there that alter ego is abandoned.
p5,01:59:52.120,01:59:57.560,spk_3,"Yeah, but your I mean your basic"
p5,01:59:57.560,02:00:06.040,spk_0,"point. Well, it's recorded, actually in 17. Can I just find the point? I think I'm just giving you,"
p5,02:00:07.910,02:00:10.270,spk_2,"it's in the facts and issues. Yes,"
p5,02:00:10.270,02:00:20.120,spk_0,but Mr Justice Akins judgment he records the exchange that happened with Mr Fakhrizadeh succession. Let me correct

p5,02:00:23.830,02:00:30.400,spk_0,72. I'm grateful that I was trying to do too much my memory. Can I clarify my learned friend has helped me on this.
p5,02:00:30.410,02:00:43.470,spk_3,Your basic point there is that whether or not the tribunal applied or thought it was applying the common intention test. We have to re apply it to our own conclusion.
p5,02:00:43.790,02:01:21.730,spk_0,"That is the bottom line of all of this, identifying for you at some length the difference between French law and transnational law to make sense of Article 5(1)(a). And in truth, to diffuse some of the criticism that's wrongly being made at the Court of Appeal judgment. Because the world has not understood that there is this difference between transnational law and French transnational law, and the English court has properly applied French transnational law. But the big point and the only point that ultimately matters is it makes no difference. Whatever the tribunal did doesn't change the nature of the examination by the court. The court must re look at it and fine and come to its own determination."
p5,02:01:22.610,02:01:36.710,spk_3,Can you Miss Heilbronn mentioned that there's been some criticism and you mentioned some sensitivities but this harbour and simply referred to the blogger as I recall. Is there anything else? Yes there is.
p5,02:01:36.750,02:01:50.440,spk_0,There is one article. I'm reluctant to refer to it because it's misconceived. I'll refer to why I'm addressing this point in some detail. It is in the  [inaudible]. And it's by

p5,02:01:56.510,02:02:11.490,spk_0,"All right, they're both. They're two critical articles [inaudible] which we can hand up, which may be it may be helpful, but what --"
p5,02:02:12.160,02:02:13.210,spk_1,you've seen
p5,02:02:13.400,02:02:25.720,spk_0,"these are the ones that my learned friend referred to the point. The misconception in these articles is that the English court is acting in an insular fashion, according"
p5,02:02:25.720,02:02:26.250,spk_1,to you -- yes you're right --
p5,02:02:27.100,02:02:32.510,spk_0,"and has has read French law, excluding transnational law."
p5,02:02:32.520,02:02:33.460,spk_1,Now
p5,02:02:33.470,02:03:07.290,spk_0,"the answer to that is, no, it has not. It has read French law, including transnational law, properly, and that was what Mr  [inaudible] and  [inaudible] testified on. The difference, however, is the English court, quite properly under the conflicts rule in Article 5(1)(a) of the New York convention is not looking beyond what the French court would do. It's not looking at some open ended non French transnational law, which might include good faith might include  [inaudible] [inaudible] might include anything else alter"
p5,02:03:07.290,02:03:07.820,spk_4,ego.
p5,02:03:09.000,02:03:21.510,spk_0,"That is the point. And I think once the world understands that point that then it makes sense because what the English court has done is no different from pyramids, SPP Pyramids. It's the same principle of the French court applied."
p5,02:03:23.100,02:03:25.250,spk_3,So we have to write something that the world understands.
p5,02:03:25.270,02:03:37.770,spk_0,"I'm hesitating to give a mandate such as that. But when one talks about talks freely in this field about the Mutual Association for International Arbitration, sometimes abbreviated as Mafia"

I'm saying there are sensitivities because arbitral seats compete for business. People are ready to where I was going and I'm going to ask whether the court needs me to go there is to give some examples. If I'm by submission of where I think the tribunal might not have applied, the properties"
p5,02:04:11.860,02:04:13.460,spk_1,are listed in your case.
p5,02:04:13.470,02:04:15.160,spk_0,They are all in my criticism.
p5,02:04:15.160,02:04:16.340,spk_1,I thought they were independent.

p5,02:04:22.360,02:04:25.210,spk_0,analytically is inconsistent with their case. So we're
p5,02:04:25.550,02:04:26.500,spk_1,really looking at --
p5,02:04:26.500,02:04:27.360,spk_0,it's annex a.
p5,02:04:28.530,02:04:28.860,spk_1,The
p5,02:04:28.860,02:04:42.840,spk_0,"only thing I can do this shortly. All my criticisms of the tribunal, the ones which I made the former justice actions, the ones that he found and which the court of appeal confirmed are all set out in my written case, they are summarised in annex a."
p5,02:04:43.790,02:04:44.620,spk_1,
p5,02:04:44.790,02:05:20.350,spk_0,"What I can do now in so far as it may be of assistance to round off some of these points is just to give some examples. For each of these criticisms, there may be a response. We'll know the tribunal did do it properly, but in the end, the court can't rely upon what the tribunal has done its insufficiently articulated. So let me give you some examples. It was the evidence of Monsieur [inaudible]  and Monsieur Battier and accepted by Mr Justice Akins that you must test the intention of all parties; Dallah,"
p5,02:05:20.350,02:05:21.120,spk_3,
p5,02:05:21.610,02:05:37.520,spk_0,"the government of Pakistan and the trust that was there evidence of French law. If you look at the tribunal's articulation of the test that they're applying, they only mention Pakistan."
p5,02:05:41.090,02:05:42.810,spk_3,So
p5,02:05:42.820,02:05:57.060,spk_0,you find their test articulated in the first partial award at internal page 26 paragraph 6 and 7.
p5,02:05:57.260,02:05:58.090,spk_2,This is a key
p5,02:05:58.090,02:06:04.700,spk_0,difference between what they did and what the evidence was in front of Mr Justice Akins and what he found.
p5,02:06:05.080,02:06:05.370,spk_3,"Yeah,"
p5,02:06:05.980,02:06:15.810,spk_0,"if I can take the Lordships if you have it at paragraph 7, internal page 26 That's partial award."
p5,02:06:16.680,02:06:17.540,spk_1,The
p5,02:06:17.550,02:06:30.340,spk_0,"tribunal state this In the light of the foregoing rules and principles, I e the test that they are applying, the arbitral tribunal will look into the actions of the defendant. That's Pakistan"
p5,02:06:30.420,02:06:32.370,spk_2,and the foregoing rules and principles
p5,02:06:32.440,02:06:36.490,spk_0,arbitral as well as judicial case law. In paragraph 6
p5,02:06:38.280,02:06:41.000,spk_2,"they don't identify more explicitly,"
p5,02:06:42.220,02:06:42.890,spk_0,and the only
p5,02:06:42.900,02:06:52.320,spk_1,"reason why they're looking at the defendant is because asking the question, What about the party who didn't actually sign the main contract was this isn't so called directly"
p5,02:06:52.320,02:07:05.320,spk_0,involved. Yes but that's not the French law test. The French law test says you must look at Dallah and the Trust Pakistan because it's a test of common intention. Everybody has got to have the same intention at the same point in time.
p5,02:07:05.330,02:07:06.830,spk_4,"They say that in paragraph 6,"
p5,02:07:06.840,02:07:30.900,spk_0,"but then they say in six, but in seven, they've articulated what. Then again, I want to do this fairly. I'm reading this critically, but we get we get no indication from here that they're spelling out the test in the same way as it was spelt out in evidence in front of Mr Justice Akins. Now, when they come to applying this test to the facts, they then don't look at --"
p5,02:07:30.910,02:07:35.130,spk_2,I mean paragraph 6 isn't too bad as a general statement. As
p5,02:07:35.130,02:07:51.400,spk_0,"Monsieur [inaudible]  testified, you were shown this in the transcript by my learned friend, he says broadly, for what it's worth, there's a coincidence of tests, but it's not enough. It's not detailed enough, and we spent three days after detailed expert reports going through the detail of the test in front of Akins."
p5,02:07:52.420,02:07:55.640,spk_3,Your point is basically anyway all they did was look at the defendant
p5,02:07:55.780,02:07:56.350,spk_0,did.
p5,02:07:56.990,02:07:57.850,spk_2,Exactly and that's what they did.
p5,02:07:57.850,02:08:45.460,spk_0,"When you go through their application of this test to the facts, they haven't tested Dallah's intention. They put the trust aside, they should look at that as well. But where have they looked at Dallah's intention? Where do they test that? Where do they see how Dallah instructed their lawyers or Dignam? I showed you that letter yesterday, when they instructed their lawyers to drafting the agreement in the name of the trust. Well they haven't tested that. Where do they analyse the change between the MOU and the agreement from Dallah's perspective not done. Done by Mr Justice Akins and confirmed by the Court of Appeal. Can I point you to the court of"

It is This is what the Court of Appeal held said. It is interesting to note in this context that although French law directs the court to the common intention of the parties as the foundation of any"
p5,02:09:09.280,02:09:10.490,spk_2,"agreement,"
p5,02:09:10.570,02:09:20.610,spk_0,little attention appears to have been directed to the question whether Dallah demonstrated any intention to enter into an agreement with the government of Pakistan. This is my
p5,02:09:20.610,02:09:21.930,spk_2,"point, if"
p5,02:09:21.930,02:09:56.620,spk_0,"it did intend to do so. It is surprising, to say the least, that it was content for the government neither to be named as a party to the agreement, nor to sign it in any capacity, and that it did not seek any other formal or informal statement of its intention to be bound. So that is the court of appeal making this point, the tribunal has not applied what the French courts, the test the French courts would do if I can just make this good further. If Your Lordships get the time to look at SPP against pyramids, what's"
p5,02:09:56.620,02:09:57.440,spk_2,the reference to that?

p5,02:10:25.460,02:10:26.590,spk_0,can give you another reference.

p5,02:12:49.040,02:12:49.380,spk_0,it is
p5,02:12:49.390,02:12:58.160,spk_2,because every subsequent paragraph deals with the four sub paragraphs of paragraphs

Now again, this may be unfair criticism. Maybe it wasn't in front of them. Maybe they did look at it but didn't articulate it in the award. But you can't confidently say that they're doing the same exercise because they're not looking at the whole sequence. They are, in the words of the court of appeal, impaling the governor of Pakistan on an isolated admission. And that's not the French law test. That's the reference.

There was an acceptance by the French experts and by Mr Justice Akins recorded in his judgment at paragraph 91 Mr Justice Akins judgment that you have to when applying this test bear in mind that as a matter of French law, the quarter concessional decision in Crichton and Qatar, a French state that agrees to an arbitration governed by French law in France, will be taken to have waived its sovereign immunity, not just with respect to jurisdiction, but also with respect to execution. Okay, now, that's the French Quarter final decision in France. They say that the rules include a waiver of sovereign immunity, not just jurisdiction, but also execution against state assets.

p5,02:16:44.219,02:17:30.420,spk_0,"I'm afraid it's settled. Unfortunately, just as we were about to argue it. The point is, it's Article 24 of the Old ICC rules, which was analysed in Crichton, Qatar's Article 28 of the current ICC rules, and it's got a provision which says the parties undertake to carry out the award and the Court of Cassation in Paris has interpreted this as amounting to a waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to execution because a very extreme position where.

It's not anywhere considered by the tribunal. All I'm doing is highlighting the differences, and I won't take this so far, but can I just make a couple other points on the significance of state? There is the question of Article 173 of the Pakistan Constitution, also held to be relevant by the French law experts. Article 173 of the Constitution, you may recall, is the provision that either mandates or recommends, there was an issue about that,"

p5,02:18:37.030,02:19:47.650,spk_0,"The tribunal did not consider it. The French law experts had confirmed and agreed that this would be a relevant factor in the French test. My Lord, I'm not going to continue anymore. But these are  the points to suggest that there is a difference, and where it comes to really is it's just not good enough for Dallah to say, Well, the experts broadly agreed that the test applied by the tribunal was the same. That is weak analysis. If I may say with respect, there was no evidence before Akins on the kind of tests that the tribunal purported to apply. In the end, all that this court needs to rule in my submission is that firstly, it doesn't make any difference because the court has an ability to come to its own determination. Secondly, what Mr Justice Akins did and the Court of Appeal did was entirely proper. Under Article 5(1)(a), they applied French law, which is what Article 5(1)(a) mandates them to do, and in so doing, they applied the transnational law elements of French"

It was a point that My Lord, Lord Clarke raised earlier. The only reason to mention this is if and insofar as the court wants to come to a wants to explain the use of the law of the country in Article 5(1)(a)rather than what it was in 1958 they may not have used rules of law."

p5,02:28:05.520,02:29:34.350,spk_0,"a full rehearing is required as a matter of statutory construction. That is, construction of Section 103(2) of the 1996 Arbitration Act and the New York convention itself. That is, in paragraph's 222 to 227 of my written case forcefully, because the precise definition of an extrinsic form of review or a lighter form of review is difficult to articulate and unworkable, i e. the alternative is unworkable, and that is in paragraphs 228 to 233 of my written case. Fifthly, a full rehearing is consistent with the New York convention scheme overall, and by that I mean the relationship in the New York convention between the courts of the seat and recognising and enforcing courts. There's a balance between them in the New York convention, and that allows for a full rehearing at the stage of recognition and enforcement. It requires that, and that is in paragraphs 234 to 248 of my written case, 63. Because a full rehearing is the prevailing approach in all other major arbitration jurisdictions, and I"

Suggested form of review Paragraph 249 to 266 of my written case. And lastly, insofar as there in any energy left because the A full rehearing is consistent with current theory on international arbitration, something which the English courts have not frequently dabbled with. And that is paragraphs 267 to 273. There are prevailing theories of arbitration. Monsieur [inaudible], Mr Paulson, many others and all of those they agree on. They disagree on many things that they would agree on a full rehearing. Now that can be done in two minutes or 10 days. But it's all set out in the written case, and I, of course, will be guided by the court as to what it may need assistance on."
p5,02:30:33.400,02:30:43.680,spk_1,"I must say, having read the case, it's pretty thoroughly set out so I doubt whether you really need to go over all this ground again. How much longer are youroposing to address us after lunch"

p6,00:02:49.770,00:02:55.780,spk_3,I start with some aspects of the nature of the exercise? I know we started with phrases
p6,00:02:55.790,00:02:57.030,spk_0,which perhaps are more familiar

p6,00:03:01.780,00:03:03.140,spk_0,on what to distinguish
p6,00:03:03.140,00:04:15.060,spk_3,"the different nature of the exercise, but if for present purposes, one looks at it more generally. The first point I'd like to raise is the issue of substantive jurisdiction which came up yesterday afternoon, which I have dealt with in my case on the issue of scope. Because, although scope can mean an interpretation of a contract, i.e. whether the difference is a difference that is covered, it can also mean whether or not that particular party had agreed for that particular issue to be before the tribunal, so that it's not necessarily only a question of contractual interpretation, it has an underlying jurisdictional import, and that can be seen, and I won't take Your Lordships to it, but that can be seen from some of the Canadian cases, which I set out in my case, starting at page 146. And whilst a lot of them, in fact all of them, are dealing with annulment at the seat, the point of those cases really is two-fold. One,"
p6,00:04:15.070,00:04:16.160,spk_0,they are under
p6,00:04:16.170,00:04:18.079,spk_3,Article 34 of the Model

p6,00:05:45.780,00:05:46.550,spk_0,Section
p6,00:05:46.560,00:05:56.130,spk_3,"82, which refers back to Section 30, includes not only issues as to the validity of the"

That is, as to whether there is a valid arbitration agreement, whether the tribunal is properly constituted and what matters have been submitted to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement, and that by Section 82 is stated to be the meaning of substantive jurisdiction. So the point of these comments is that if jurisdiction is based on consent, which I think everybody in this room agrees upon, such consent is not confined to what my learned friend calls the a priori situation,"
p6,00:06:49.020,00:06:49.660,spk_0,but
p6,00:06:49.660,00:07:24.180,spk_3,"it can also be a situation where there is -- the tribunal is constituted but takes upon itself something which the parties had not agreed that it would determine. For example, if you take in this case, instead of the issue being whether or not the GOP were a party, assume, for example, they were a party to an arbitral tribunal, but only for a particular dispute. And another dispute they had very deliberately kept outside the"
p6,00:07:24.180,00:07:25.470,spk_0,arbitral process.
p6,00:07:25.750,00:07:43.180,spk_3,"It would seem looking at it logically, that it would be equally unfair for them to be brought before that tribunal on that basis, as it would be if there wasn't a tribunal constituted in the first place, if the issue is consent, so that -- Yes,"
p6,00:07:43.180,00:07:46.680,spk_4,"well, why is it equally unfair? I think Mr Landau says it is."
p6,00:07:47.340,00:07:56.660,spk_3,"Well, I think, with respect, Mr Landau takes a out the validity of the arbitration agreement. If you look at his case --"
p6,00:07:57.160,00:08:11.360,spk_4,"In oral submissions, when this point was put in, he said, logically, there might be a slight presumption, or perhaps a strong presumption, that arbitrators got the scope of their jurisdiction"
p6,00:08:11.360,00:08:12.260,spk_0,right.
p6,00:08:12.270,00:08:13.650,spk_5,"But logically,"
p6,00:08:14.140,00:08:14.400,spk_0,the
p6,00:08:14.400,00:08:15.470,spk_4,court has to reexamine

p6,00:08:18.340,00:08:58.390,spk_3,"but the point being that when you're looking at the scope and that -- the only point I'm making from this is when you look at, because there is limited authority on this issue, but when you look at the Canadian cases, albeit that their cases at the seat, they are looking at the scope and therefore, if the issue is one of consent, they are saying that the courts in Canada are saying that even in such cases, apart from the situation where the issue is whether or not the tribunal's acting within its powers, the separate issue is whether there is jurisdiction and therefore you have to give a weight to the award. That's the only point I'm making."
p6,00:08:58.400,00:09:17.270,spk_1,"Is it pointless that there's a sort of shading, as it were, of the force of the argument, of absence of consent the further you go into the procedure, and you accept, do you, that it's absolutely fundamental that there should be consent to the arbitration agreement. Well, yes. Absolutely"
p6,00:09:17.270,00:09:17.970,spk_0,so.

They may become matters of things that somebody might say was outside the scope of the award, but it would be a debatable issue. Is it that kind of thing?"
p6,00:09:36.630,00:09:46.920,spk_3,"It would be -- it would depend on the facts of each particular case. And when you look at the NAFTA type cases, the issue is whether one of the parties should be before the tribunal, not whether the"
p6,00:09:46.930,00:09:47.880,spk_0,issue should be before the tribunal.
p6,00:09:48.660,00:09:56.240,spk_3,"That's the distinction I'm making. If you are looking at whether or not the party should be there, as opposed to whether or not the issue should be"
p6,00:09:56.490,00:09:56.990,spk_0,"there,"
p6,00:09:57.110,00:10:34.320,spk_3,"and if you're looking as to whether or not the party should be there, it should make no difference whether or not the tribunal, there  was a tribunal properly constituted or whether there wasn't one constituted at the beginning. I think that's as far as I can take it, but it's simply because it does give some guidance as to the nature of the exercise. The other point, just to again, just for your note, and I'm not taking you to it, the recent case of the Republic of Serbia does deal with the two sorts of jurisdiction, and that's at Volume 2(77), and that's at paragraph, I think, it's 113"

p6,00:10:44.160,00:11:02.500,spk_0,right. I have set it out.
p6,00:11:03.200,00:11:03.840,spk_3,I'm sorry. It's at Paragraph 118 of my case.

p6,00:11:56.530,00:12:20.880,spk_3,"Well, he's saying that as well there seems to have been an argument as to whether or not it applied to a situation, whether the arbitrator, it's really the -- where the question's, where the position is different, where the jurisdiction issue is whether a personal entity is a party to the underlying contract. It's"

When you -- and really, from Lord Mance in Yukos and Dardana, when you are looking at Article 5, the award is, on any view in our submission, provisionally recognised and enforced. And it must have a status, because it is the antithesis to, for example, Ground E, which would say that it was set aside. But also, if you're looking at Article 5 in the round, it must be a valid binding agreement, because the court has a power to not enforce it on the grounds of public policy. So if one was looking at the public policy criteria which we're not today, but if you were,"
p6,00:14:05.710,00:14:06.380,spk_0,the
p6,00:14:06.380,00:14:33.260,spk_3,"court would have to look at that award as an existing instrument and determine, according to that enforcing court's national law, whether or not it was against that own court's public policy, so it must have an important status, and we say it has a more important status than is alleged by the government of Pakistan. It"
p6,00:14:33.260,00:14:50.220,spk_1,"is interesting to see how that article is laid out. The public policy thing comes in Article 2, Article 5(2), and there's a group there of the two things that are separated out. The subject matter's not capable of settlement by arbitration."
p6,00:14:50.230,00:14:51.170,spk_0,That's
p6,00:14:51.170,00:15:24.250,spk_1,"assuming, I imagine, that you've agreed on this. You've got your arbitrators and so on and so forth, but you met with the argument that you can't actually resolve your particular thing. It may be something to do with matrimonial status or something of that kind, but everything else, the agreements are all there, it's just simply an objection on this particular point. But I think the point against you is that it's a question of different levels as you approach the subject, and the further you go back to the very root point of the initial agreement, the more powerful the argument becomes."
p6,00:15:24.440,00:16:01.470,spk_3,"It may well be that, as I think I've submitted, it is a question of the weight that you give and it may be, but take a public policy situation. I mean, HEBE is a good example, although probably there wasn't any public policy in there, but there are many cases where something is held not to be against the public policy by the arbitral panel, perhaps because it's a foreign law, but yet it would be contrary to the English public policy.

p6,00:16:12.550,00:16:27.760,spk_3,"as in Subsection 1. But underlying that is Article 2, which prefaces both, namely, that there is, at the very least, a provisionally recognised and enforced award."

p6,00:16:28.920,00:16:41.520,spk_3,"Lord, it was said yesterday, also, that this is rather like Section 67. Section 67 is a challenge to an award. That's very different in our submission"

p6,00:16:42.510,00:16:57.990,spk_3,"enforcing an award, and that difference is recognised in the convention itself, because a challenged award, i.e. an award which is set aside, is a specific ground under Article 5(1),"

p6,00:17:00.330,00:17:17.530,spk_3,"which a court can or cannot enforce. So that the test of setting aside should not, in our submission, be the test that's applicable to enforcement. One has to look at the enforcement"

p6,00:17:18.339,00:17:21.360,spk_3,on its own as to what is the appropriate
p6,00:17:21.370,00:17:22.350,spk_0,exercise.
p6,00:17:22.860,00:17:24.730,spk_3,"I move now from that, I'll come"
p6,00:17:24.730,00:17:58.080,spk_4,"back to that. The only reason that is so is there's a recognising or enforcing court, isn't the right court to set aside an award? All that is of interest under Article 5 is whether it's going to be recognised and enforced, and there are various grounds set out which, as My Lords pointed out, operate at various levels of seriousness, but the enforcing or recognising court doesn't actually concern itself with those grounds in themselves. They are simply reasons for refusing recognition or enforcement."
p6,00:17:58.090,00:19:19.500,spk_3,"I agree entirely, but the point I was making is that it doesn't, because it is a reason, it doesn't follow automatically that the manner in which the award is set aside has to be the same exercise as the manner in which an award is enforced. Because you are looking to different things, and one is looking to challenging the awards, setting aside the award. The other is looking to enforce an award, and they are different, with respect. And therefore, while obviously my learned friend argues that they're the same in our submission, you don't -- that is not the starting point that they are the same, because one is enforcement and one is setting aside. If you set aside at the seat, then it is recognised, even though it is not always accepted, even if its set aside that it will be enforced. Once you've set aside the award seat, it's recognised. It's going to have wider implications than if you if you enforce, perhaps not in this country. Say, in a small country whose jurisprudence perhaps is not internationally recognised elsewhere, that enforcement may have a more limited effect on the underlying award than the setting aside. The only point I make, therefore, is that it's not automatic that the test is the same."
p6,00:19:20.240,00:19:34.800,spk_1,"But it could be that the country in which the enforcement issue arises is the only country where, in practice, the party who holds the award is going to get any benefit from it at all, the place where the assets are. Well, that is right."
p6,00:19:35.390,00:19:35.600,spk_3,There
p6,00:19:35.600,00:19:45.150,spk_1,"could be these cases, and it doesn't matter. There are lots of other signatories to the convention and so on because there's nothing there, so it could be as important, couldn't it, in certain cases?"
p6,00:19:45.160,00:21:05.710,spk_3,"My Lord, I'm not saying it's not as important. I'm saying that under the convention, there is nothing which says that the test has to be the same. After all, the convention doesn't deal with it, and the test under the convention is whether or not my learned friend has proved the test under the Article 67 is slightly different and it will be slightly different in other jurisdictions. All I'm saying is that you have to look specifically at the test, it may be important, but you have to look specifically at what the court is doing, and it doesn't follow that it's necessarily the same. Now, this morning we spent some time on transnational law. I think to an extent there is a limited agreement between us that transnational principles are applied by the French courts, the issue being as I understood it, whether or not the tribunal had applied the French law principles using the transnational principles. My Lord, you've been taken to Dalico, which is a flag 6. There is also the commentary that I drew your attention to yesterday, flag 9 of B,"
p6,00:21:05.720,00:21:12.590,spk_0,"the authorities bundle, is that B(1)?"

p6,00:21:56.640,00:21:58.780,spk_0,I'd
p6,00:21:58.790,00:22:00.790,spk_3,just like to make a few points on
p6,00:22:00.790,00:22:02.240,spk_0,this. A
p6,00:22:02.250,00:22:04.020,spk_3,distinction was made between what
p6,00:22:04.020,00:22:05.100,spk_0,the French courts would
p6,00:22:05.110,00:23:34.860,spk_3,"do what an arbitral panel sitting in France would do. But what we're looking at here is what the French courts would do when considering what an arbitral panel sitting in France would do. And therefore, in our submission, it's a distinction without a difference, because what you're looking at is what the French courts were doing, in effect, what the French court will do in France when the contemporaneous enforcement proceedings are determined. And the expert evidence was agreed between the two experts, the transnational law was a part of French law, and I've taken you to the joint memorandum. It was also agreed, and it was put to both witnesses that good faith is a part of French law and a reference, for example, of M. Vatier, because it's only two sentences, I asked him, [inaudible] with good faith a part of French law? And he said, Yes. It's B, tab 5, page 104. I don't think we need to turn it up, but importantly, you will recall yesterday, and I don't want to take you to it again, but I put to M. Vatier, who is the government's witness, Paragraph 6 of the tribunal's award. And that was the award, which refers"

p6,00:34:25.280,00:35:19.480,spk_3,"Well established as a basic legal rule of the international law of arbitration, international arbitration agreements are autonomous, and that such autonomy means on the one hand the Arbitration agreement is separable from the main contract which relates and that its existence and validity are to be determined on the basis of its own terms. And then if you go, for example, to Paragraph 3, where we have a further reference to the French test judicial as well as arbitral case law now clearly recognised that as a result of the principle of autonomy, the rules of law applicable to an arbitration agreement may differ from those governing the main contract. Such rules need not be linked to a particular national law, and they refer to Dalico but may consist of those transnational general principles. And then he says that whilst Dr Shah and Lord

p6,00:36:08.940,00:36:15.140,spk_5,seem to have been applying the French notion of transnational principles. Do they generally? Not expressly.
p6,00:36:16.020,00:36:17.610,spk_0,We'll see

p6,00:38:52.070,00:38:54.390,spk_3,behaviour which raises the presumption.
p6,00:38:55.920,00:39:08.950,spk_4,"No, that's actually not right and that maybe it does seem interesting that the arbitrators in Paragraph 6 used the phrase directly involved in the negotiation"

The fact is that during the 1998 proceedings, which I take it, you have among other things in mind, although the government of Pakistan's attitude was that it had become party to the agreement on the demise of the trust. Nonetheless, when it commenced the 1988 proceedings, its attitude was that it was no longer party to the agreement, let alone to an arbitration clause. And it was seeking in declaration and injunction on that basis so that viewing the fact that arbitration agreements, what we're talking about and autonomous it's a bit difficult to say that there was any common intention at that point to be a party to an arbitration agreement, how much your clients may have wanted the government of Pakistan to be."

There is simply the same evidence and it is an interpretation that is being made by the court as to what that evidence means. And the we went through earlier, the different stance of the government, various stages in the Pakistan proceedings in what they said to the tribunal and as Lord Clark said he had, the witnesses haven't been tendered for cross examination and any court when they have got evidence which in our submission is certainly susceptible of different interpretations, must attach a different weight to that than with the government had come along with witnesses with"

So you have got a double whammy, so to speak, speak of the government involvement at the end of the day and in our submission, the when one is looking at the exercise that a court has to give when forcing, remembering that the onus is on the government and whatever the exercises, whether it's a rehearing, a review, it is for the government to prove this fact, and one has to remember also the first time"

p6,01:02:23.810,01:02:24.730,spk_0,trust
p6,01:02:24.740,01:02:33.380,spk_3,"that I'm making a different point. Namely, that when one is looking at whether or not the government is presumed to be accepted an arbitration"
p6,01:02:33.380,01:02:34.460,spk_0,clause when
p6,01:02:34.460,01:02:36.720,spk_3,they were involved in the drafting of that
p6,01:02:36.720,01:02:37.940,spk_0,agreement. If
p6,01:02:37.940,01:02:41.660,spk_3,"they accepted the agreement, they must have known of the"
p6,01:02:41.660,01:02:42.910,spk_0,arbitration clause.
p6,01:02:43.130,01:02:45.710,spk_3,And if you then go to page 18 to

p6,01:02:51.260,01:03:10.230,spk_3,"to its further stated that the agreement also requires the following changes. Amendment two, in view of the observations of the Ministry of Finance on Clause 24 23 26 would be required to be deleted. So the evidence we have is clearly"
p6,01:03:10.240,01:03:11.720,spk_0,whatever
p6,01:03:11.730,01:03:50.060,spk_3,"because the government approved this agreement at the end of the day, whatever arbitration clause was included, the government knew about it and the government would have known what was agreed by way of the arbitration clause.

p6,01:04:05.630,01:04:07.260,spk_3,set of proceedings.
p6,01:04:07.270,01:04:08.620,spk_1,I think you're at risk of repeating
p6,01:04:08.630,01:04:09.420,spk_3,that I'm repeating
p6,01:04:09.420,01:04:10.320,spk_0,"myself. My lord,"
p6,01:04:10.330,01:04:12.440,spk_3,let me move
p6,01:04:12.540,01:04:13.280,spk_0,to
p6,01:04:13.280,01:04:24.670,spk_3,"one further point. And that is that The government, of course, could have reps erected as I mentioned earlier, the trust retrospectively and then brought proceedings in its neck."
p6,01:04:27.290,01:04:35.110,spk_0,"Mhm. So, my Lord,"
p6,01:04:35.690,01:04:39.880,spk_3,I don't want to repeat the points that I have
p6,01:04:39.890,01:04:41.130,spk_0,made. But when
p6,01:04:41.130,01:05:05.290,spk_3,"you are looking at the exercise, we would submit that even if the tribunal reasoning could have been better and it would have helped my argument if it had been clear if one looks at the Canadian cases in analogous situation is that in itself should not be a reason why, if the results at the end is"
p6,01:05:05.290,01:05:06.570,spk_0,"correct,"
p6,01:05:06.580,01:05:28.830,spk_3,"that necessitates a complete rehearing, ignoring what had gone before and effectively substituting the English courts view applying French law of what the position was here because at the end of the day, the onus is on the"
p6,01:05:28.830,01:05:29.790,spk_0,government to
p6,01:05:29.790,01:05:38.810,spk_3,"prove that it was not a party, and under French law, it has to do that from beginning to end. I"
p6,01:05:38.820,01:05:39.960,spk_1,"think I think we have,"
p6,01:05:39.970,01:05:42.060,spk_3,and I think that concludes my submission.
p6,01:05:42.380,01:06:00.320,spk_5,"Just ask you one question. This morning's submissions by Mr Lander. Namely, how the case was put to the tribunal. I'm a bit confused about that. We saw the letter in the period before the letter from the arbitrator, which we looked at one of the arbitrators we looked"
p6,01:06:00.320,01:06:02.910,spk_0,at this morning.
p6,01:06:02.920,01:06:07.540,spk_5,We do we have the submissions that were submitted to the arbitrators
p6,01:06:07.550,01:06:10.710,spk_0,"before that, My Lord, I mean,"
p6,01:06:10.710,01:06:12.560,spk_5,"I would you believe there were written sufficient to thee,"
p6,01:06:12.910,01:06:13.630,spk_0,"my lord,"
p6,01:06:13.640,01:06:20.830,spk_3,"the position, as far as I can relate as far as I've checked, was clearly initially the battle"
p6,01:06:20.830,01:06:21.640,spk_0,was
p6,01:06:21.650,01:06:22.910,spk_3,Pakistan Law
p6,01:06:22.920,01:06:23.360,spk_0,Saudi.

p6,01:06:33.820,01:06:34.940,spk_5,arguments to
p6,01:06:34.940,01:06:42.290,spk_3,"the tribunal, I simply can't. I have a feeling I did, but I wouldn't like to say I did, because it's so long ago. I can't remember. There was there"
p6,01:06:42.290,01:06:51.330,spk_5,was the idea that it might not be either Saudi law or Pakistani law. When was that live? Was that live during the actual arbitration before the letter?
p6,01:06:51.920,01:06:57.420,spk_3,"That's what I cannot 100% remember, because it's some sort of 10 years ago"

What I don't know is whether or not, of course, the government put in. And I can't remember putting written submissions to the tribunal in response to the same point in the"
p6,01:07:22.640,01:07:38.360,spk_5,"original claim for arbitration. Case was put on some sort of agency. It was indeed, yes, that rather fell by the wayside. Yes, it did. And then there was the alter ego point and the succession point. They were lied."
p6,01:07:38.680,01:07:40.190,spk_0,I
p6,01:07:40.200,01:07:45.950,spk_3,think the position is we have got it. I'm sorry. We have
p6,01:07:45.960,01:07:47.190,spk_0,got the
p6,01:07:47.190,01:07:51.770,spk_3,"response that we put into the letter is a flag eight,"
p6,01:07:51.780,01:07:52.750,spk_1,which bundle?

p6,01:07:55.590,01:07:57.160,spk_4,remind me where the letter was?
p6,01:07:57.170,01:07:59.320,spk_3,"The letter, I assume, is"
p6,01:07:59.330,01:08:00.800,spk_4,it's in the new documents.
p6,01:08:02.260,01:08:07.620,spk_0,One of these additional. I'm not sure - is it?
p6,01:08:07.620,01:08:08.030,spk_4,that
p6,01:08:08.770,01:08:10.670,spk_3,"I think that's wrong. No,"
p6,01:08:10.670,01:08:11.800,spk_0,wrong. I'm
p6,01:08:11.800,01:08:18.279,spk_3,sorry you've been given given There is There is a document which which I found on
p6,01:08:19.310,01:08:20.450,spk_0,the
p6,01:08:20.460,01:08:22.359,spk_3,response that we put
p6,01:08:22.359,01:08:23.049,spk_0,in
p6,01:08:23.960,01:08:25.180,spk_1,B
p6,01:08:25.770,01:08:27.890,spk_3,in response to the
p6,01:08:27.890,01:08:35.020,spk_0,nine. That's the letter. That's
p6,01:08:35.020,01:08:35.640,spk_3,the letter
p6,01:08:35.650,01:08:36.850,spk_0,we
p6,01:08:36.850,01:08:39.790,spk_3,put in a response.
p6,01:08:40.170,01:08:41.069,spk_0,I do not
p6,01:08:41.069,01:08:46.690,spk_3,believe it's specifically dealt with common intention as such.
p6,01:08:47.120,01:08:47.680,spk_5,"No,"
p6,01:08:47.680,01:08:48.810,spk_3,"it's not in the bundle,"
p6,01:08:49.049,01:08:49.750,spk_0,but
p6,01:08:49.750,01:08:53.950,spk_3,I do have it because I drafted 10 years ago.
p6,01:08:53.960,01:08:57.700,spk_0,I I
p6,01:08:57.710,01:09:11.089,spk_3,don't believe because I looked at it quickly over the weekend that it specifically refers to common intention. But I would have to double check what we don't know. And what I can't remember is whether or not there was a response from the government to this as well.
p6,01:09:11.100,01:09:12.960,spk_0,So
p6,01:09:12.970,01:09:20.380,spk_3,"in a sense, I'm reluctant to give it to you because it presents only half the picture because I don't know what the government said in response. If they did this"
p6,01:09:20.380,01:09:21.730,spk_0,"letter, whether"
p6,01:09:21.730,01:09:24.400,spk_3,"they replied or not, I don't know the answer to that."
p6,01:09:24.970,01:09:26.980,spk_0,"I mean, they"
p6,01:09:26.980,01:09:28.540,spk_3,"would have replied without prejudice,"
p6,01:09:28.540,01:09:30.490,spk_1,obviously.
p6,01:09:30.870,01:09:35.420,spk_3,But the transnational principles emerged during
p6,01:09:35.430,01:09:36.319,spk_0,the
p6,01:09:36.330,01:09:50.330,spk_3,"process. What again I can't remember is whether or not because looking at their letter, I have a vestigial recollection that it's something may have happened in the oral hearing, and then it was followed up by the letter,"
p6,01:09:50.420,01:09:52.500,spk_5,but there was no actual French
p6,01:09:53.270,01:09:55.600,spk_0,"law evidence? No,"
p6,01:09:55.600,01:09:56.420,spk_3,there was no French law
p6,01:09:56.420,01:10:06.890,spk_1,"evidence. Judging by what they put in and the narrative at the beginning of the judgement, they are presented with two different systems of national"
p6,01:10:06.890,01:10:07.690,spk_3,"law. Yes,"
p6,01:10:07.960,01:10:08.980,spk_1,so that
p6,01:10:08.980,01:10:10.740,spk_3,was that was the battleground
p6,01:10:10.750,01:10:11.550,spk_1,to start with.
p6,01:10:11.560,01:10:17.290,spk_3,And they clearly although they took a different view when it came to the actual agreement
p6,01:10:17.460,01:10:17.960,spk_0,where the
p6,01:10:17.960,01:10:21.090,spk_3,"battleground was the same, they concluded that was Saudi"
p6,01:10:21.090,01:10:22.150,spk_0,law for the
p6,01:10:22.160,01:10:23.430,spk_3,purpose of the arbitration
p6,01:10:23.430,01:10:24.830,spk_0,agreement.
p6,01:10:24.840,01:10:26.250,spk_3,they took a different view.
p6,01:10:27.360,01:10:28.570,spk_1,"Well, is there anything more?"
p6,01:10:28.580,01:10:38.500,spk_0,"I don't think so, it's just the closing [inaudible]"
p6,01:10:38.500,01:10:43.880,spk_3,"my Lord, I think other than really"
p6,01:10:44.660,01:10:46.540,spk_0,the
p6,01:10:46.550,01:10:52.480,spk_3,ultimate position that my clients find themselves it is namely that they
p6,01:10:52.480,01:10:53.330,spk_0,have
p6,01:10:53.340,01:11:02.260,spk_3,"incurred expense and they have an award against them, which is not being paid. And this is 10 years down the"
p6,01:11:02.260,01:11:03.350,spk_0,line.
p6,01:11:03.530,01:11:11.150,spk_3,"And it is a factor, obviously, which your Lordship will bear in mind in looking at the overall the aspect of this"
p6,01:11:11.150,01:11:11.800,spk_0,case.
p6,01:11:12.160,01:11:18.720,spk_3,"Lord, unless there's any other further points, I'm conscious that there's a great temptation to repeat oneself, and I don't want to do it again."
p6,01:11:19.460,01:11:22.390,spk_0,"Well, I think I think the"
p6,01:11:22.390,01:11:27.580,spk_1,court is extremely grateful to counsel on both sides for their assistance. We will take time to consider our
p6,01:11:27.580,01:11:43.880,spk_0,decision.
