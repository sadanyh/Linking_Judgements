00:00:45.180,00:01:10.260,spk_1,"could I mention before you begin a matter of timing. We ask that the court should sit at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. What we proposed to do is to sit on until lunchtime tomorrow. Maybe there's a reasonable chance of actually finishing by lunchtime and that would be convenient for various reasons, if that could be achieved. But I hope it doesn't inconvenience counsel too much if we sit at 10."
00:01:11.170,00:01:17.020,spk_2,"Absolutely not. I'm grateful to My Lord and we are all at the bar of the indication of having coming in advance. So we've made the necessary arrangements."
00:01:17.030,00:01:18.290,spk_1,"Thank you very much, indeed. Thank you."
00:01:19.470,00:04:11.340,spk_2,"My Lords. My Lady, In this matter, I appear with Mr Desmond Rutledge for the Appellant Mr Barry Austin, the Respondent, Southwark London Borough Council is represented by my learned friends Mr Drabble, Queen's Counsel, and Mr Shaw Kelly. My Lords and and My Lady will have seen that we have identified five issues on which we would invite the attention of this court and I propose to deal with them in the sequence set out in the agreed statement of facts and issues starting with issue one, which might probably be described as the tolerated trespass question. The question posed for this court by issue one is whether the possession order made against him ended the late Mr Allen Austin's tenancy or whether, in the alternative, he was at the date of his death, still the tenant of the council. That's the issue to which the first of the matters on this appeal goes. May I start on that issue very briefly with the possession order itself, which is the operative instrument that is to be found in the appendix at page 5. May I before coming to its terms, simply put it in its procedural context. The court will recall that 52 Michael Faraday House, described in in the first paragraph of the order on page 5, is a one bedroom council flat, which was let to Mr Allen Austin in July of 1983. The possession claim, which led to the making of the possession order on page 5, was brought under the claim form at page 3 in June 1986. So he's been a tenant for a little under three years by the time the claim was brought. As page 4 indicates the initial possession proceedings were adjourned over to this hearing on the 4th of February 1987 when the order for possession was made. In a departure from other methods of recording court proceedings, there is no indication on the form of order as to whether the defendant attended the hearing. The form used, I'm afraid that the court can only just see this from the bottom left hand side, is the standard template form N28, suspended order for recovery of land, which was the form required under order 22 of the old county court rules, where an order for recovery of possession was to be suspended."
00:04:11.720,00:04:13.410,spk_0,"Is it the form currently in use?"
00:04:13.470,00:04:25.310,spk_2,"No, My Lord, it's not. The form currently in use is substantially different, not least in that the form currently in use provides for a date on which possession is to be delivered up."
00:04:25.320,00:04:30.800,spk_1,"Lord Neuberger I think referred to that didn't he? A form that have been designed differently."
00:04:30.900,00:05:20.710,spk_2,"Indeed, My Lord, what what happened was that the form was twice revised after the making of this order in 1987, it was first revised in 1993 when provision was made for the addition of a date, and it was further revised in 2001. Part of the reason for all the recent attention to the tolerated trespassing question was that in 2006, the Court of Appeal decided that the form in use since 2001 had in fact been in order for outright possession rather than suspended. And that meant that vast numbers of people who had not been thought to be tolerated trespassers had been since 2001."
00:05:21.250,00:05:22.350,spk_1,"That was the Harlow case."
00:05:22.360,00:05:23.500,spk_2,"That was My Lord, yes."
00:05:24.670,00:05:26.680,spk_3,"This looks like a forthwith with possession."
00:05:27.040,00:05:27.790,spk_2,"Indeed it does, My"
00:05:27.790,00:05:28.380,spk_1,"Lady."
00:05:29.080,00:05:40.690,spk_2,"And as we shall see in just a few moments, Lord Justice Millet, as he then was, thought that the Court of Appeal might have interpreted in Tomthson v Elmbridge this form of order as it were being an outright order for possession."
00:05:40.750,00:05:48.030,spk_3,"I wasn't suggesting it was an outright order, I was suggesting it was an order for possession forthwith suspended for 28 days on conditions."
00:05:48.040,00:07:57.530,spk_2,"Yes, My Lady. That's been part of the difficulty in framing the template orders under Section 85 of the Housing Act 1985. It appears that draftsmen have not really got their heads round the distinction between the delivery of possession, that is the order for possession and then the execution of that order. And as My Lady says, if I may say so perfectly properly, this appears to be an order for possession under which execution of the order is made conditional. However, that is not how it has been interpreted. One might think surprisingly, and when it was so interpreted in Harlow v Hall, that was then that was the dynamic for the changes that then took place. So well, My Lady as ahead of certainly me, in terms of the terminology of the order, I took My Lords and My Lady to the description of the order, as form N28 suspended order for recovery of land, but the terms of the order are in the first paragraph that it is a judge that the plaintiff do recover against the defendant possession of the land mentioned, and in the second paragraph, a monetary judgment for arrears of rent and cost of £95, coming to, as the court will appreciate, the wrong total figure. The figure is in fact, £100 higher. In the third paragraph, it's ordered that the judgment for possession shall not be enforced for 28 days in any event, and for so long thereafter, as the defendant punctually pays the plaintiff for his agent, the arrears of rent mean profits and costs by the 4th of March 1987. We shall see shortly that the words which have been blanked out there and indeed you can just make out the last of them, are per week in addition to the current rent, because the common use of this form would been to require installments of X pounds per week in addition to the current rent. Those words been deleted in this case to provide that everything must be paid by the 4th of March 1987."
00:07:57.540,00:08:00.160,spk_3,"Do you suppose that anybody intended that? To"
00:08:00.160,00:08:00.700,spk_2,"delete it, My Lady?"
00:08:02.390,00:08:08.290,spk_3,"Do you suppose that anybody intended that the whole arrears should be paid by the 4th of March 1987?"
00:08:08.750,00:08:10.000,spk_2,"Indeed, My Lady."
00:08:10.040,00:08:11.770,spk_3,"It"
00:08:11.770,00:08:41.690,spk_2,"is a sad fact that these cases are dealt with in great bulk. The judges do not complete the orders. They simply usually fill in a pro former provided by the court staff, and the court staff then take away the pro former and transfer it onto this template. If it's any comfort, the prospects for this template being correctly completed are better, as reflected by the fact that it's been completed in handwriting that has been possible with the benefit of information technology."
00:08:41.940,00:08:44.650,spk_0,"Do you suggest that Mr Austin probably wasn't present?"
00:08:45.290,00:08:47.900,spk_1,"There's no proposals were made about the"
00:08:47.910,00:08:49.000,spk_0,"payment of arrears."
00:08:49.650,00:09:18.270,spk_2,"I accept that inference, My Lord, but I can't confirm one way or the other. It's speculation. It's simply speculation, but it is indeed extraordinary that it might be contemplated to the council tenant who is behind with his rent is going to find £3400 in the next 28 days and pay it and thereby achieve what appears as My Lady has already indicated to be, the stay of enforcement of the order for possession, which has already been made."
00:09:18.740,00:09:19.970,spk_3,"Well, I find it astonishing."
00:09:20.020,00:09:31.040,spk_1,"What wants to be meant by the first payment, then if it's all to be paid in a single figure? I don't understand that, it is rather than as an indication that there might be installments, but you don't know what they are."
00:09:31.830,00:09:32.110,spk_2,"Well."
00:09:32.110,00:09:38.580,spk_3,"Well, he does actually, of course, go on to say the whole thing has got to be paid on the 4th of March, but it just seems"
00:09:38.580,00:10:12.210,spk_2,"extraordinary. Well, nothing may be added by going over the forensics of it in any greater detail. Safe to point out, for example, that it doesn't provide that he's got to pay the current rent until the 4th of March, because by accident those words have been deleted as well. It provides he's got to pay to the plaintiff the arrears of rent, meaning profits and costs, which is, as My Lady suggests, rather suggests that the intention is to be an immediate order for possession or at least unqualified order for possession. However, this was the template design for suspended"
00:10:12.210,00:10:13.140,spk_3,"orders. It"
00:10:13.140,00:10:26.100,spk_2,"can only be inferred that that's what the District Judge thought he was doing in making the order in these terms, and we note further on in the order that, of course, the entry for current rent to be stipulated has been omitted."
00:10:27.430,00:10:28.910,spk_1,"Well, there we are. Let's say [inaudible]."
00:10:29.480,00:10:30.510,spk_2,"Walks the door,"
00:10:30.510,00:10:32.270,spk_0,"That's the form. Well,"
00:10:32.280,00:10:34.970,spk_2,"[inaudible] normal order and not unrepresentative"
00:10:34.980,00:10:36.030,spk_1,"of exactly the sorts"
00:10:36.030,00:12:51.880,spk_2,"of orders that I'm afraid were and still are, to a certain extent, being made in the hurly burly of the county court. Indeed, we see from the note, which is on the prescribed form, under the words take notice, that the rubric is that if you're ill or out of work, you should ask your landlord to suspend the order until you're better at back at work. If he will not do so, you should ask the court officials to help you prepare an application to the judge, presumably inferentially to suspend the order, which apparently has already been suspended. Or this is the template for a suspended order. However, warts and all, that is the order for possession that was made. Tens of thousands of orders in this form N28 are and were in 1987 made each year, and, as I've indicated sadly often with just about the same care to detail. As the court knows, the defendant, Mr Allen Austin, did not leave the property on the 4th of March or in any date thereafter, nor did he comply with the obligation to pay the £3400 by the 4th of March 1987. So that the order certainly became enforceable on the 4th of March 1987. It never was enforced, and as we know, Mr Allen Austin was still there in that flat on his death some 18 years later in February 2005. The tenancy which Mr Allen Austin had had had been a secure tenancy and secure tenancies have been first introduced by the Housing Act of 1980. By 1987 when this order was made, the provisions have been consolidated into the Housing Act of 1985 and we have in the bound volumes in volume 4, at tab 42 the act as it stood on consolidation, and therefore, as it was, operative on the date of making a possession"

00:13:15.140,00:14:55.280,spk_2,"and we have reproduced the page 41 using the numbering at the top of the pages of the sections material to the granted possession against a secure tenant. Section 82 is the section which bears the marginal notes, security of tenure, and it provides that a secure tenancy which is either a weekly or other periodic tenancy. We needn't read the B, cannot be brought to an end by the landlord except by obtaining an order of the court for possession of the dwelling house. Section 82(1) envisages, therefore, termination by the landlord obtaining an order of the court for possession and what we've been looking at is an order of the court for possession. Section 82(2) provides that where the landlord obtains an order for possession of the dwelling house, the tenancy ends on the date on which the tenant is to give up possession in pursuance of the order, and it is Section 82(2) and the interpretation thereof that has caused some of the difficulties in relation to tolerated trespass and to which I shall have to return in just a few moments. However, the importance ofSection 82 for present purposes, is that it provides that the tenant has security  of tenure because the tenancy can only be brought to an end by the landlord by obtaining an order for possession. The remaining provisions of what is part 4 of the 1985 act will be very familiar, I think, to members of the court. The Section 83 provides for a preliminary notice of proceedings for possession so that the tenant is, in effect, given a warning. Section 84 provides a statutory"
00:14:55.280,00:14:56.070,spk_3,"injunction"
00:14:56.870,00:19:20.530,spk_2,"in Section 84(1), that the court shall not make an order for possession of a dwelling house led under a secure tenancy, except on one or more of the grounds set out in schedule 2, so that the making of a possession order is conditional upon the landlord having satisfied one of the statutory grounds. Furthermore, Section 84(2) provides conditions, in addition to grounds. It provides that the court shall not make an order for possession on the ground set out in part 1 of schedule 2 unless it considers it reasonable on the ground set out in part 2 of that schedule unless satisfied suitable alternative accommodation will be available, or C, on the grounds set out in part 3 unless it both considers it reasonable to make the order and is satisfied suitable alternative accommodation will be available. So it is always necessary for the landlord of a secure tenant to establish for the court both a ground for possession and that the relevant condition in Section 84(2) is made out. And of course, the link between the warning notice and the ground for possession is made by Section 84(3), which provided that the court shall not make an order on any of those grounds unless the ground is specified in the notice, in pursuance of which proceedings for possession are begun. Section 85 then contains importantly, what is described as the extended discretion of the court in certain proceedings for possession, and it provides a series of extended discretions available to the court. That Section 85(1) provides that where proceedings are brought for possession of a dwelling house let under a secure tenancy on any of the grounds set out in part 1 or part 3. That is to say, cases in which the court must be satisfied that it's reasonable to make a possession order, the court may adjourn the proceedings for such period or periods as it thinks fit. It is important, therefore, to appreciate that the statutory extra discretions contained in Section 85 are limited to those cases in which the condition is that it must be reasonable to order possession. Subsection 2, having dealt with adjournment in Subsection 85(1), Subsection 85(2) provides that on the making of an order for possession of such a dwelling house, on any of those grounds, or at any time before execution of the order, the court may, A, stay or suspend the execution of the order or, B, postpone the date of possession for such period or periods as the court thinks fit. So included in that extended discretion are two discretions in, A, referring to execution of the order and in, B, referring to postponement of the date for possession. It has been observed judicially on more than one occasion that the subsection may have been more sensibly structured to have reversed A and B to deal first with the moment of the date for possession and then to deal with stay or suspension of execution. Subsection 3 makes provision for conditions and provides that on adjournment stay, suspension or postponement the court shall impose conditions in respect to payment by the tenant of arrears of rent, if any, and rental payments in respect of occupation after the termination of tenancy, mean profits, unless it considers that to do so would cause exceptional hardship to the tenant or would otherwise be unreasonable, and it may impose such other conditions as it thinks fit. 4, if the conditions are complied with, the court may, if it thinks fit, discharge or rescind the order for possession. Subsection 5 then makes provision in relation to spouses and former spouses and provides that where proceedings are brought for possession of a dwelling house, let under a secure tenancy, an attendant spouse or former spouse having rights of occupation under Matrimonial Homes Act, then in occupation and be the tendency is terminated as a result of those proceedings. The spouse or former spouse shall so long as he or she remains in occupation, have the same rights in relation to or in connection with any adjournment, stay, suspension or postponement in pursuance of this section, as he or she would have, if those rights of occupation were not affected by the termination of the tenancy."
00:19:20.890,00:19:25.700,spk_1,"Subsection 5 has been taken out. Subsection 5 is no longer there, am I right?"
00:19:25.710,00:19:26.790,spk_0,"Indeed, My Lord."
00:19:26.800,00:19:40.280,spk_2,"Two things happened. First of all, Subsection 5 was extended to deal with cohabitees and others, by the addition of a Subsection 5(a), and then most recently, both 5 and 5(a) have been repealed."
00:19:40.380,00:19:43.770,spk_1,"Are they reenacted in some other form or are they just simply gone?"
00:19:43.780,00:19:53.090,spk_2,"No My Lord they've simply gone, and the reason that they have simply gone is as My Lord well appreciates that Section 82 itself has been amended to remove Section 82"
00:19:53.090,00:19:54.150,spk_1,"(2)."
00:19:54.160,00:20:07.480,spk_2,"And to provide that, the tendency only ends on execution of the order. So there never needs to be an application in relation, by a spouse, in relation to a terminated tenancy because the tenancy can't terminate."
00:20:08.300,00:20:17.960,spk_1,"And so far as we're looking at the original Subsection 5, it doesn't actually, it's not conditional on the the the other partner of the spouse is being still alive."
00:20:17.960,00:20:20.260,spk_2,"Exactly so My Lord and as [crosstalk]."
00:20:20.260,00:20:22.050,spk_0,"Which is a point you're going to come back to."
00:20:23.380,00:21:01.930,spk_2,"Well, we deploy it in two senses, My Lord, first it was a statutory intention that the extended discretion may be available to others than the person who was the original secure tenant i e. their spouse or former spouse, but also that it postulates the situation that the spouse or former spouse, the other spouse or former spouse may apply, even though the original tenant is dead. My Lords and My Lady, those are the provisions which deal with the making of orders of possession so far as they were concerned, contained in the primary statute."
00:21:02.480,00:21:26.680,spk_3,"Can you just help me [inaudible]? It hasn't previously occurred to me that Subsection 4 provides a discretion. Now one might have thought that where you've made a conditional, possession order and the condition was fulfilled, you ought to have a duty to rescind the order."
00:21:27.650,00:22:10.730,spk_2,"Well, My Lady, if I may say so, in policy terms, it may have been contemplated that whilst you were complying with the conditions, something else may have arisen. Yes. For example, one of the cases included the bundle is the case of Finn, in which the lady had a possession order made against her, conditionally, on terms of payment of arrears of rent, but then misbehaved in the property and the question was, well, could the landlord then go back to court as it were and unscramble the original terms based on these new situations. So I suppose, My Lady, it may have been contemplated that you have a situation under 85(4) where a person would come forward and say well I've have paid off in accordance with the arrangement, and the landlords would say, well, hold on a minute don't rescind the order because there's this other matter."
00:22:10.900,00:22:15.710,spk_3,"So the landlord didn't have to start from scratch again, in those situations?"
00:22:15.720,00:22:30.430,spk_2,"That was what the Court of Appeal decided in the Manchester v Finn case, because if it had to start again, then you might have a situation in which there were two possession orders operative in relation to the same property, which is not entirely attractive."
00:22:30.430,00:22:32.300,spk_3,"You know, I was suggesting that you ought to --"
00:22:33.770,00:22:35.400,spk_2,"to be treated as automatic?"
00:22:35.410,00:22:46.580,spk_3,"Or have a duty to rescind it, and therefore if a condition of being complied, never mind. That's a side wind. I'm just noticing things that I hadn't noticed before."
00:22:46.590,00:23:43.690,spk_2,"I'm obliged, My Lady. Of course, one of the issues which we don't have to address in this appeal is the extent to which the court could express itself in the original order as to what would happen if you did comply with all the conditions. So it might say in the original order, this order shall be treated as discharged if you clear all the arrears, and when the template form was redesigned in 1993 there was further consideration of the last paragraph of what we have in our order, at paragraph, very last paragraph above the head in current, I'm back on page 5 of the appendix, where the order provides through the words, and also, that the judgment, judgments indeed, shall cease to be enforceable when the arrears of when mean profits and costs referred to above are satisfied."
00:23:44.340,00:23:48.360,spk_1,"That could be expanded or qualified, you suggest?"
00:23:48.370,00:23:49.180,spk_0,"Well, My Lord"
00:23:49.280,00:24:00.220,spk_2,"it could as I was suggesting in answer to the question from My Lady, Lady Hale, perhaps deal more explicitly with the discharge or rescission of the order itself."
00:24:00.690,00:24:01.230,spk_1,"So"
00:24:01.230,00:24:41.820,spk_2,"that a judge could provide, not simply that the order will cease to be a forcible when the rent arrears etcetera is paid, but that the order shall thereupon stand discharged. But I think as My Lady correctly observed, I don't think I can help further on that point usefully in relation to the present appeal. My Lords and My Lady, the question of the impact of a possession order in a form such as that made in respect to Mr Allen Austin was first considered on appeal in the case of Thompson v Elmbridge, which the court has to volume 3, tab 33 it's one of only"

The local authority granted a tenancy of the dwelling to the applicant's wife. That tenancy was a secure tenancy. The wife fell into arrears of rent, and in January 1985, the local authority obtained an order in the county court for possession of the property that was not to be enforced 'for 28 days in any event' and so on, and we should look at that order in just a moment. The wife, as a result of matrimonial problems, departed permanently from the house in August 1985 and by September had permitted arrears of rent to accumulate so as to be in breach of the court order. Thereafter, the applicant that is her husband, who was unemployed, remained in occupation of the property, current rent being paid by the DHSS. In January 1986 when the applicant was still in occupation, the local authority obtained a warrant for possession of the property against the wife from the county court office. Thereupon the applicant, by way of originating application, applied to the county court to be added as a defendant in the possession proceedings taken by the local authority against his wife so as to be able in the course of divorce proceedings to have the tenancy of the property transferred to him by virtue of provisions of the Matrimonial Homes Act. On the 28th of January, the judge refused the application on the ground that pursuant to Section 82(1), the secure tenancy had terminated before the date of the application. The judge also dismissed an alternative claim by the applicant under the provisions of Section 3 of the Protection of Eviction Act. On appeal held, one, dismissing the appeal, one, that since by virtue of Section 82(1), a secure Tenancy terminated on the date when a tenant had to give up possession under a possession order, where a secure tenant failed to comply with the terms of the possession order suspended pending punctual payment of current rent in arrears and was thereby in breach of the order, the tenancy terminated at the moment of the breach. That accordingly, the wife's tenancy of the dwelling house had terminated in September 1985 when she first failed payment view and thus no secure tenancy existed, capable of being transferred to the applicant under the provisions of the Matrimonial Homes Act. So the question arose little indirectly, not on the tenants or former tenants application. Former tents exist, but indeed on the application of a spouse. The order that was made in that case appears at page 1428 of the report between letters E and"

00:27:32.650,00:30:53.690,spk_2,"and as Lord Justice Russell observes, just before extracting the terms of the order in the last sentence between D and E, he says that the order was in a form to be found at N28 of the prescribed form to the county court, and gives the reference, and then says the order so far as material reads, and as the members of the court will appreciate, the wording of the order is in the same template of form N28 as that used in Mr Allen Austin's case. However, in this case, there was use of the requirement for payment of current rent. After giving the address of the premises in relation to whcih the order for possession was made, the order continues in its fourth line, and the plaintiff to recover against the defendant the sum of 498, 82, for arrears of rent together with some represented costs. It's ordered that the judgement for possession will not be enforced for 28 days, in any event, and for so long thereafter, as the defendant punctually pays the plaintiff or his agent the arrears of rent and costs by installments of £10 a week in addition to the current rent. I emphasise those words and also that the judgement shall cease to be enforceable when the arrears of rent and costs referred to above are satisfied. As Lord Justice Russell then observes, it is to be observed that on the face of the order, it does not purport to terminate the tenancy. The tenancy in my judgement plainly continues and is recognised by the order as continuing. The judgement for possession, however, is suspended so long as the current rent is paid in addition to the arrears. If that were not the true interpretation of the order, then plainly the words of the current rent to which I have adverted would not appear as they do. That was the interpretation then by the Court of Appeal of an order in the template form N28, that the tenancy continued and the judgement for possession itself was suspended so long as the current rent was being paid in addition to the arrears. What then happened, as we see from the next following paragraph, is that the Court of Appeal went on to hold that the tenancy determined on breach, at letter H, that Lord Justice Russell says Mrs Thompson did not comply with the terms of that order. In August 1985, we are told that she left as a result of matrimonial problems. She left taking her child with her, indicated to the local authority, no prospect of reconciliation. They properly advised her to receive assistance, by September 1985, it is acknowledged on all sides, Mrs. Thompson had again permitted arrears of rent to accumulate and was in breach of the order obtained against her in the county court. When she left the matrimonial home, the applicant remained. The rent was paid by DHSS. None of the arrears was paid after her departure, and then the factual situation is, they described, the question that the court was addressing at that juncture is set out at 1429, letter F. In this appeal, therefore, the question arises whether there was on the 5th of February 1986, when the husband applied an extant secure tenancy which could be transferred."
00:30:53.700,00:30:55.360,spk_1,"So yay"
00:30:55.360,00:32:02.450,spk_2,"or nay, was the tenancy still on foot? In order to answer that question, Lord Justice Russell looked again at the statute and in particular Section 82(2) which he set out at the foot of page 1429. He was then shown a Rent Act case of Sharon v Brand, which were advanced by counsel for the husband, between D and A, supporting the contention that the tenancy had not come to an end, and he rejected that submission on page 1430 before letters, between letters F and G. He describes his holding as this, just above letter F, what I think is more important than indeed crucial is that insurance that Sharon's case was dealing with an entirely different code of legislation, namely the Rent Acts to that with which this case is concerned, namely the Housing Act 1985 and, in particular, in the instant case, the court has the advantage of the statutory provisions which are earlier referred, namely Section 82(2), which seeks to define the date when the tendency is"
00:32:02.450,00:32:03.450,spk_3,"to come to an end."
00:32:03.470,00:32:05.850,spk_2,"Accordingly, I'm of the opinion that court is free"

00:32:06.840,00:33:16.680,spk_2,"brand both on facts and law. He's then between G and H, sets out Section 82(2) again, he reverts to the terms of the order at letter H, and writes on the penultimate line on the page he says, in my judgement, once the defendant in proceedings of this kind where there is a suspended order for possession, ceases to comply with the conditions of the order, namely the punctual payment of the current rent and arrears, and there is a breach of the terms of the order, the tenancy, whatever it may be from that moment comes to an end. I perhaps ought to just explain the words, whatever it may be, because one of the issues in the case was whether the tenancy could still be a secure tenancy, given that the tenant had left. But Lord Justice Russell is clear that whether it's secure or insecure at the moment of breach, it came to an end, and that is made clear on page 1431 at letter D, where in mid paragraph, he says, whatever the nature of the tendency, in my judgement, it came to an end on the 5th September 1985 when the wife first breached the terms of the order."
00:33:17.180,00:33:21.160,spk_3,"But the landlord wouldn't have been allowed to send the bailiffs in the moment that happened, would they?"

But the court staff simply need to be told yay or nay is their noncompliance with the order. Indeed, they were not told that, they were simply filling in a form.

It is necessary for the application to be made under what is still county court order 26 for there to be execution of the order, and that is by warrant of possession, and a warrant of possession is obtained only on application.

Yes, but this court, the Court of Appeal in that case appears to have held that because the tenancy had ended, there was nothing further in relation to which he continued to have a matrimonial right, but that seems to fly against the closing words of the subsection, which are that the rights are not affected by the termination of the tenancy.

00:37:17.500,00:37:58.040,spk_2,"85(5), My Lady, was part of an attempt to address across all three statutory regimes, the particular problem of a tenancy having ended in a situation where a spouse had matrimonial home rights. So an equivalent provision was introduced into the Rent Act, Extended discretion into the Housing Act, extended discretion and, I believe, when eventually enacted into the Housing Act 1988. As Lord Neuberger was subsequently to describe in this court, sorry, the House of Lords judgment in Knowsley v White, this was simply an aspect of torrential drafting."

I say that it was redundant at any event, if needed, but in so far as it had any use, its use appears to have been removed altogether by the passage on page 1432, which appeared to private applications at a very classic case to which it might be thought it ought to have been applied.

This very rapidly produced a situation in which there were a large number of former tenants because there is no requirement in the analysis of Lord Justice Russell that the breach be deliberate. Sadly, there would be a breach if the payment were a day late, or a penny short, or if there had been an interruption of housing benefit or some other circumstance."

It was therefore, in the same template as that made in Mr Allen Austin's case. It was submitted by Regan in that case that the order had ended the tenancy, on breach. That appears from page 473. The last full paragraph on that page. Accordingly submitted, the original secure tenancy ended on 4th September 1989 when the defendant first committed a breach of the conditions on which the order was suspended. Lord Justice Millet then considers the operation of Section's 82 to 85, in terms which we'll revisit in a moment because they're considered by the House of Lords in Burrows v Brent, but can I go straight to page 476 to pick up this point,"

00:45:33.240,00:48:10.550,spk_2,"centre paragraph on page 476 says this, I have read the terms of the order in the present case. Literally construed, they would appear to bring the tendency to an end almost immediately and only to stay, suspend or stay the enforcement of the order. But the order is in the same form as that which was considered by this court in Thompson v Elmbridge. Despite the infelicity of the language of the order of this kind, it was not there treated as an order for immediate possession, coupled with a stay of execution. On the contrary, it was treated as an order requiring the delivery of possession to be postponed in the first instance for 28 days and thereafter until there was a breach of conditions of the order. As a result, the court held that tenancy came to an end at the date of the first breach of the conditions. This may have been a generous interpretation of the order, but it was necessary to avoid the creation of a status of irremovability, unsupported by the existence of any tenancy somewhat akin to the statutory tenancy under the Rent Act, but which is inconsistent with the machinery and security provided by the act, and in particular with the provisions of Section 85, and 85(4), under which the decision or discharge of the order is to leave the tenant in possession under his original tenancy and act as a tenant at sufferance who cannot be evicted. It is that passage in relation to generous interpretation of the N28 that I thought it right to take the court in the light of the question My Lady put to me earlier. One the face of it, therefore, Justice Millet, like My Lady would take the order first impression to be in order for immediate possession coupled with a stay of execution, and that may have been a generous interpretation, says Lord Millet, but that's what we've been doing for the last 10 years and will continue in that way. The Big Bang change came when the template order was reformed and restructured to include a date on which Possession was to be given.  I'll come back in due course, if I may, to Regan in relation to Section 85, but I wish, if I may, to stay with the key question of whether Thompson v Elmbridge was correctly decided as to the tenancy ending on breach, and the next case to consider is Burrows v Brent, a decision of Their Lordships house, indeed, delivered six months after they appeal, that considered Greenwich and Regan.

The question, he says at the end of that paragraph, is whether such an agreement between former landlord and former tenant operates so as to create a new tenancy which can only be terminated if the landlord obtains a further order from the court. As Lord Neuberger was to subsequently observing exchanges in Knowsley v White, it suited both parties in Burrows v Brent to start from the proposition that the possession order had ended the tenancy. Lord Brown Wilkinson, however, in his speech, sets out the statutory scheme. First, the factual background on page 1450, then on page 1451, three statutory provision. It is right to draw attention to the fact against myself that on page 1451 at Letters D to E, he sets out Section 82 including section 82(2), and he says that letter E it is important to note that the secure tenancy ends not on the date on which possession is in fact given up, but on the date on which the order requires the defendant to give up possession.

That is to say, the 12th of February 1992. So not only suit her purpose, but that was the argument she was advancing. In the Court of Appeal, the council had taken the position described in letters on the same page 1452 between letters F and G, but abandoned that position in the light of Greenwich v Regan, as we see from the bottom of page 1452, the argument advanced to the House by the council in Burrows is set out in a series of propositions at the foot of page 1452, and the first proposition is that although under Section 82(2) the original tenancy came to an end on the 12th of February, being the date fixed by the order, that was not necessarily the final position. So the submission of both parties was that the tenancy had ended on the date stated in the possession order."

00:52:16.820,00:53:15.630,spk_2,"Having set out the analysis of Section 85, the extended discretion then offered by the council at paragraphs 345 and 6, over the page, Lord Brown Wilkinson at Letter E, opens the paragraph with I accept this analysis of the effect of Section 85 which is derived from the judgment of Lord Justice Millet in Greenwich v Regan, and he sets out the facts of that case. He says at letter F the tenant in that case, sought a stay of execution. He submitted. The old tenancy had come to an end when he failed to comply with the conditions imposed by the order, see Thompson v Elmbridge. May I just pause there, My Lords and My Lady? Because it may be said that Lord Brown Wilkinson is approving Thompson v Elmbridge since that's the only reference he makes to the decision in his speech. As I hope it's tolerably clear that what he was there doing, is reproducing what the tenant argued in Greenwich v Regan."
00:53:15.640,00:53:19.590,spk_1,"Well, I think that's clear from that sentence and also the following one, its the submissions."
00:53:19.600,00:59:14.450,spk_2,"Indeed, My Lord. That's right. My Lord, the speech continues with an analysis of the position in Regan and the view of Lord Brown Wilkinson in relation to it. There are some passages which I ought to go to in page 1454. Perhaps it is more sensible to start at the foot of 1453, letter H, penultimate line. They, that is to say the Court of Appeal in Regan, distinguished the decision in the present case on the ground that they were dealing with a suspended conditional order of the court, whereas in the instant case there is an immediate unconditional order for possession. One factor which weighed heavily with the Court of Appeal in Regan's case, to which I also attached importance is the practical effect of the decision under appeal i e. any consensual variation of an order for possession produces a new secure tenancy or licence. I do rely on that passage, My Lord, because Lord Brown Wilkinson is himself identifying the importance of the practical effect of the decision when one is deciding how to approach it. He then explains that local authorities want to grant indulgences and so on, and between letters C and D on the same page, he says, yet the effect of the local authority agreeing to such a reduction will be that the tenant, while keeping up his payments at the agreed reduced rate, will be in breach of the conditions specified by the order at the higher rate. If so, his old tenancy will be terminated, thereagain reflecting, it must be said, what Thompson v Elmbridge had decided, although not expressly dealing with that point. Netween letters E and F, again on the practicability point, he says, I find it impossible to believe that Parliament intended to produce such an unreasonable regime, penalising sensible arrangements out of court, and requiring repeated applications to an already overstretched court system. Now, although that is said in a different context, we would respectfully say, here it is impossible to believe that Parliament contemplated the chaos in relation to tolerated trespasses which Thompson v Elmbridge produced. Lord Brown Wilkinson then goes on from letter F to offer the correct legal analysis of the statutory provisions, and at letter H, the last paragraph on the page. He says this, a secure tenancy protected by part 4 of the act is not like an ordinary tenancy. It can only be terminated by an order of the court ordering possession to be given on a particular date, or in a particular event, but even determination by order of the court is not final until the possession is executed, the court can, by variation of its order, change the date on which possession is to be given, thereby reviving secure tenancy which has already been terminated during the period between the date specified by the order for the giving of possession, and the date on which the order is executed, there was a period of limbo. The old tenancy is gone but may yet be revived by a further order of the court varying the date for possession. If the parties reached an agreement as the continued occupation of the premises by the tenant during that limbo period, what is the intention to be imputed? In my judgement, little guidance from the cases where a tenant holds over in relation to the ordinary tenancy, the position in relation to secure tendencies is sui generis. In my judgement, the agreement can and should take effect in the way the parties intend. Agreement by the landlords that upon the tenant complying with the agreed conditions, the landlord will forbear from executing the order i e. from taking the step which would finally put to an end the tenant's right to apply to the court for an order reviving the tenancy. If I may say so, Lord Brown Wilkinson is there struggling as practitioners have had to struggle with the language. It is not indeed if this description position is right, the landlord and the tenant who are agreeing, it is the former landlord and the former tenant who are agreeing about execution or otherwise of the order. It is at the end of that paragraph between, letters C and D that he says it is fair to characterise the former tenant as a trespasser, whom the landlord has agreed not to evict, a tolerated trespasser pending either the revival of the old tenancy or the breach of the agreed conditions, and thus, once the effect of Section 85 is appreciated, the absurdities which led to the Court of Appeal not to accept that Ms Burrows could be a tolerated trespasser, disappear. Technically, the old secure tenancy is, during the limbo period, no longer in existence. So in those circumstances, both parties having asserted that the tenancy had ended. That position is accepted by the House, but the House decides that the agreement for conditional retention of occupation is exactly that. Ms Burrows is to continue on terms as a trespasser in the property. Lord [inaudible] gives then give us a separate speech, which also forms part of the majority, given that Lord Griffiths and Lord Steyn expressly agree with him. He sets out between letters E and F on page 1456, Section 82(2), and he adds the following between letters F and G. This provision, that is to say, 82(2) is mandatory, with the result that occupation by the tenant after the date specified in the order ceases to be attributable to the original secure tenancy, and, of course, he was dealing with an order which did include a date. He does mention Thompson v Elmbridge, over the page 1457 between letters B and D."
00:59:16.460,00:59:17.080,spk_1,"We're"
00:59:17.080,01:04:12.400,spk_2,"in describing Section 85 and its effect, he says, between D and E. If, during the initial proceedings, the court makes an order but postpones the date of possession, the tenancy will not be terminated under Section 82(2) until any condition imposed under Subsection 3 has been breached by the tenant, Thompson v Elmbridge. Now he's not there setting out any argument, and it must be taken to that extent that he is there approving Thompson v Elmbridge. He then continues, the court's power to make an order postponing the date for possession is not restricted to exercise on first application, but may be exercised on the application of either party at any time prior to the execution of the order. He then from letters F to H, pays attention to the use of the term mean profits in Subsection 3(a) as being the liability of the person once their tenancy, has determined in respect of payment for the premises, and it's in that context that he adopts the terminology tolerated trespasser between letters A and B on page 1458. Before leaving his speech, however, may I take this court to the last paragraph on page 1459, where he looks at the policy of the legislation, he says, My Lords, I agree with Mr Neuberger that the impact of Section 82(2) cannot be altered by agreement between the parties, and the impact is the impact he has described. However, for the reasons which I have already elaborated, that subsection cannot be looked at in isolation from the other sections, in particular Section 85. The whole scheme of that part is to afford protection to the secure tenant, and that is achieved in Section 85 by conferring on the court flexible powers to continue an existing secure tenancy, to revive a determined secure tenancy, or to create a state of statutory limbo which will afford to a defaulting tenant an opportunity to have restored to him, all the benefits of the secure tenancy when he has complied with stipulated conditions. Parliament cannot have intended to penalise a landlord who acted within the spirit of the act by granting indulgences, and there's further reference to the spirit of these relevant statutory provisions at letter F. My Lord and My Lady, we rely on the terms of that paragraph as indicating, although it upholds a description of the statutory scheme which for present purposes is against us,  an important attention to what the scheme is about. That is the protection of the secure tenant and the flexible powers available under Section 85. It is right to say that the decision of the house in Burrows v Brent was treated as having approved Thompson v Elmbridge and therefore, as having upheld the proposition that an order in form N28 operates to determine the tenancy on first breach. Secondly, it was treated as deciding that such an occupier, a former tenant, remains in occupation in a form of statutory limbo, not quite a tenant and not liable to pay rent, but as a tolerated trespasser liable to pay mean profits. Furthermore, the House decided that the limbo situation continued even if execution of the order was stayed on terms which were complied with. We see that from Lord [inaudible] at page 1457, letter F where he observes in the paragraphs starting however. However, whereas an order postponing the date of possession necessarily affects the operation of Section 82(2), an order staying or suspending the execution of an order for possession on a stated date has no effect on the operation of that subsection that merely postpones execution so long as the conditions of the suspension are complied with. So we had, by virtue of this decision and tolerated trespasses, in the sense, that the landlord was prepared to tolerate their trespass, and we had tolerated trespassers who were tolerated on terms set by the court. That is to say the landlord was told, you cannot execute a warrant against this person, provided they pay X and Y, but if they pay it and why they do not get their tenancy"

Those words, he says, are in my view, particularly significant since they show the act contemplates the court requiring post termination payments made by an occupier which are of a nature wholly inconsistent with the existence of any tenancy in his or her favour."

It appears to be the position taken by Lord [inaudible] more directly than Lord Brown Wilkinson, who merely as it were, cites it as part of the argument from the case of Regan.

Secondly, it was taken as deciding that thereafter the occupier remains in a legal limbo, conveniently described with the label tolerated trespass where there is no liability pay rent only a liability to pay mean profits, which might be enforced by terms under Section 85(3A), and thirdly, I was indicating that that remained the position even if execution was suspended by the court rather than as it were by agreement between the parties. As Lord [inaudible] indicated at 1457, further, the House decided that you could only get your former tenancy back by a successful application under Section 85. In particular, Section 85(2)(a). I beg your pardon, 85(2)(b), a postponement of the date,"

01:08:25.990,01:13:19.420,spk_2,"Section 85(4), that is to say, the discharge of the order. Although that was well appreciated or thought to be the effect by most practising in this field after Burrows v Brent, it's a sad fact that almost all orders for stale execution of possession made by district judge is thereafter provided for payment of current rent plus an amount of the arrears, and that's just how these things happened. The consequences of the upholding of Thompson v Elmbridge were that there were was the prospect of another dozen years from 1996, onwards of persons falling into the legal limbo because they did not comply with the conditions of their orders. As Lord Mance observed in Knowsley at paragraph 15 secure tenants often failed to comply with the conditions, whether deliberately or innocently or whatever. There were huge numbers of persons losing their tenancies, apparently pursuant to the structure of Section 82 to 85 as decided by the Court of Appeal in Thompson and by the House of Lords in Burrows c Brent. My Lords and My Lady. I'm not going to invite the court to consider at great length what those problems were, but can I briefly go to the discussion in Hassan as to the trigger for change? Hassan is in volume 1 at tab 3. Hassan is May 2006,  reserve judgment of three Lord Justice division of the Court of Appeal. What was done in Bristol City Council v Hassan was that a solicitor came up with the idea of inviting the court to make a possession order which didn't include a date, and if the court could do that, then it could avoid the Boroughs and Brent Thompson v Elmbridge difficulty. The judges concerned decided that a possession order had to have a date, and the issue came on appeal to the Court of Appeal. Ultimately, the Court of Appeal decided that a possession order didn't need to have a date and approved template of an order without a date. But may I just take the court into the judgement for relevant parts of the history, at paragraph 26 on page 2591, Lord Justice Brooke is that paragraph 26 setting out part of the history, and I picked it up a paragraph 26 because that's where he deals with Thompson v Elmbridge. He records at 26, Thompson v Elmbridge lead to a certain amount of disquiet, and he refers to some articles. However, he says, the revised version of form N28 that was issued in 1993 did not adopt the suggestion made in the articles. Instead, it was, in these quotes, user friendly terms. Paragraph 1, the court has decided that unless you make the payments as set out in para 2, you must give the plaintiff possession of the premises on brackets, insert date. And it was in 1993 therefore, that the form N28 was changed from the form in Mr Allen Austin's case. That is to say, simply, a judge that you have possession to you must give the plaintiff possession on such and such a date. After setting out the terms of the new N28 Lord Justice Brooke then concludes that paragraph by saying this was followed by the 2001 revision, and the 2001 revisions set out on page 2597, and that provides in the first paragraph, at the top of the page, the defendant gives the claimant possession of the property on or before, and again, a space for the date to be entered. If we go back into the main text of paragraph 27 on page 2591, we can see what then happened."
01:13:19.800,01:13:20.440,spk_1,"Paragraph"
01:13:20.440,01:18:26.090,spk_2,"27, although the 1993 version of N28 could reasonably be interpreted as postponing possession after the date mentioned in paragraph 1, so long as the tenant complied with the conditions set out in the order. If we just look at that in the terms set out in the immediately preceding paragraph, you must pay the plaintiff in total the sum of, by installments, in addition to current rent. When you've paid the total amount, plaintiff should not be able to take steps. It's that the Court of Appeal is saying could be interpreted. He then continues the stark language of the 2001 revision permitted no such interpretation. Possession was postponed until the date fixed in para 1, and the tendency would then come to an end through the opposition of 82(2). Thereafter, execution of the order will be suspended so long as the conditions set out in the order were complied with, see the judgement of Sir Andrew Morritt  in Harlow District Council v Hall. And it was, My Lord, Lord Simon Brown was observing a moment ago, the decision in Harlow v Hall that the new template form N28 appended to the judgement in Bristol v Hassan wasn't in fact a suspended order, but was an outright order that transmitted a whole new species of tolerated trespasses into the equation. They were people who were complying with the conditions but were nevertheless, non tenants. That produced a situation in which, as a result of the combined effect of Thompson, Burrows and the template introduced in 2001, we now had hundreds of thousands of people living in the social rented sector who were in the limbo, described in Burrows v Brent, the Court of Appeal in Hassan, I'm sorry I put it away myself, without intending to, at paragraphs 33 to 34, this is behind tab 3, set out some of the practical difficulties that had arisen in relation to the management of these hundreds of thousands of people. At paragraph 34, Lord Justice Brooke kindly reproduce the list of nine reasons why the status of tolerated trespasser was unsatisfactory for both parties, and the first reason was that the occupier couldn't enforce any covenant to repair or any other contractual term of the tenancy. That was equally true of any statutory rights which were contingent on tenant status, such as the right to buy, a mutual exchange, assign. Two, not clear where they had a right to occupy by virtue any enactment for the purposes of the Family Law Act. Three, no statutory rights for succession if he was to die. Four, an application to resurrect previous joint tenancy by postponing the date of possession can only be made under 85(2) if both the former joint tenants agree, and this may give rise to practical difficulties if one of them cannot be traced. Five, if the tenant clears the arrears before making the 85 application, they will have no standing to reinstate the tenancy. That was as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Marshall. Six, the landlord cannot enforce any covenant with regard to the former tenants behaviour or any other covenant. Seven, the statutory framework for increasing the rent payable does not apply. Eight, it has now been established that a secure tenants would be lost by breach of the conditions in a possession order and only revive if there is an application pursuant to Section 8, see. Marshall and Bradford and Lambeth and Ocaine. Nine, problems arise in respect of stock transfer between a local authority and a registered social landlord because it's only the rights of tenants which survived the transfer, and that caused the last particular problems because over a million homes were transferred from councils to housing associations, many of which were seemingly occupied by people in limbo. As the Court of Appeal noted at paragraph 37, the Law Commission had by by this time become involved in seeking a solution, and as we see at paragraphs 36 and 37, the Law Commission's proposal was for new legislation and indeed, the Law Commission set out a complete replacement renting homes bill attached to their report, which will deal with all forms of tenure and avoid this problem. However, that has not been taken forward. My Lords and My Lady I appreciate, however, that despite the long list of things that are wrong with the limbo status and tolerated trespasser status, it's not enough for me to show this court that the decisions of Thompson v Elmbridge and Boroughs v Brent were problematic in their application. I've got to show that Thompson was wrong and Burroughs was wrong to approve Thompson, whether that approval was direct in Lord Johnson's speech or indirect in the speech of Lord Brown Wilkinson, everything turns on the proper construction of Section 82(2)."

Before coming to Knowsley, may I indicate why we say it is wrong to constrict as it was construed in Thompson and in Burrows. The first reason is that it is a necessary consequence that we have a substantial application of a limbo situation. If so-- could you"

01:19:55.440,01:20:07.460,spk_2,"My Lord, and the necessary consequence of the Thompson and Elmbridge construction of 82(2) to is that we must have in the housing stock a large number of limbo occupiers."

01:21:09.220,01:21:31.030,spk_2,"My Lord, but even before 2001, the effect of Thompson and Elmbridge was that tenants were becoming innocent tolerated trespassers simply by their inability to comply with the terms of an N28. If I may just add this matter. The most common form of N 28"
01:21:31.030,01:21:32.450,spk_1,"was"
01:21:32.450,01:22:05.570,spk_2,"that the occupier pay current rent, plus a fixed amount towards the arrears, and the form N28 required punctual pay. The fixed amount for most council tenants was the amount which could be lawfully deducted from their social security benefits each week and paid to the landlord. Usually a very small some £2 or £3 odd a week, thousands of such orders were made."
01:22:06.310,01:22:06.880,spk_3,"The"
01:22:06.880,01:22:25.060,spk_2,"difficulty was that the Department of Social Security only paid the instalments four weekly in arrears. So all those people became tolerated trespassers simply because the payments from the Department of Social Security were made not weekly but four weekly."
01:22:26.110,01:22:32.810,spk_3,"And nobody told the county court that so that they draft orders, which actually fitted in with most people's lives?"
01:22:33.340,01:22:50.780,spk_2,"Well My Lady, sadly, the vast majority of these tenants are not not represented at the position hearing, so these points tend to come up ex post facto. But it is right to say that in the second of the two articles, which I mentioned in Hassan, My Lady will have seen that the authors were prospective."
01:22:51.480,01:22:52.690,spk_3,"One of them is Nick Mange. Yes, My Lady,"
01:22:53.160,01:25:14.300,spk_2,"he suggested a formal order in that article, which was adopted. It is right to say, with credit by some county courts, some judges and was not adopted by others, and the effect was that the N28 continued to be made. Worse still, when information technology was introduced into the county court, it became impossible to make possession orders other than in the prescribed forms, because the computers couldn't generate them. So one had that happened chance of finding oneself before a district judge in West London who printed his own orders and sealed them, simply because it was the only way of bypassing a system which would produce impossible orders. I only make that diversion into that story of the history in order to deal with the question of innocence. There were both people who were complying who were becoming tolerated trespasses, and there were others who were not complying for quite innocent reasons, such as those I had mentioned, and that, of course, assumes that the housing benefit system, which is paying the current rent, is in fact operating properly as well, and I hardly need develop that aspect. So the first consequence of the Thompson v Elmbridge and Burrows v Brent line was that it necessarily contemplates on that construction of Section 82(2) numbers of, and we would say large numbers of, occupiers who will be rendered into a limbo existence. The second difficulty, with Section 82(2) is that it appears to be inconsistent with the statutory scheme. Firstly, I adopt again the first factor that it produces in a regime intended to protect tenants, a substantial cohort of non tenants. But secondly, there are other indicia in the statute, that Section 82(2) was not intended to work in that way. And the most obvious one behind tab 42, that is in the 1985 act as enacted, is in Section 121, which is on page 62 of Queen Printer's copy, whereas Section"
01:25:14.310,01:25:15.520,spk_3,"121, in"
01:25:15.520,01:25:53.960,spk_2,"relation to the right to buy, which is an important right of secure tenants. Section 121(1) provides, the right to buy cannot be exercised if the tenant is obliged to give up possession of the dwelling house in pursuance of an order of the court, or will be so obliged at the date specified in the order. The first of those two alternatives envisages a tenant who is obliged to give up possession, but if the construction of Section 82(2) adopted in Thompson and Elmbridge is right, there can't be such a person, because once you are obliged to give up possession, you are an ex tenant."
01:25:55.260,01:25:57.240,spk_1,"It all turns on the use of the word tenant."
01:25:57.250,01:25:58.000,spk_0,"It does."
01:26:01.440,01:26:14.690,spk_2,"But it's important in this context that it's there describing the exercise of a right, which is available only to a secure tenant, that is to say, the right to buy. The third"
01:26:14.700,01:26:16.010,spk_1,"factor, which"
01:26:16.010,01:28:29.380,spk_2,"is important in considering whether the Thompson v Elmbridge construction of Section 82(2) is correct or not, is that if it is correct, it produces an inconsistency with the other two major statutory regimes for the protection of occupiers. It's inconsistent with the Rent Act because, as we know, a statutory tenancy continues until the occupier actually leaves pursuant to the order, and it produces an inconsistency with assured tenancies, the other main regime, because the House of Lords has held that in the assured tenancy regime, the tenancy doesn't end until possession is actually given. One might say well, so what? The other regimes apply to other classes of person, but that is not so. The assured tenancy regime, which I'll come very briefly in a moment. The Housing Act 1988 applies to social housing as much as to private housing. The largest type of provider of social housing at the present time is a housing association. They are the major providers of social housing at present. There are more new letting by Housing associations than there are by local authorities, and housing associations will have within their stock, two sorts of tenants secure tenants if the tenancy was granted before 1989, and assured tenants if the tenancy was granted after 1989. If Section 82(2) was correctly construed in Thompson and in Burrows, that the effect is to have limbo X secure tenants but no possibility of limbo X assured tenants. And the fourth feature is that all three stash regimes have the extended discretion set out in Section 85 at the end of 1985 act, but replicated in virtually identical terms in the Rent Act 1977 and in the Housing Act 1988."

It is the last stage as it were, and it is that last stage that we say is contemplated by the words is to give up possession in pursuance of the order. In other words, he's not"

01:30:35.620,01:30:36.780,spk_3,"I thought that is what you meant."
01:30:38.380,01:30:43.150,spk_1,"I mean it could possibly say if it had been intended to mean"

01:30:53.900,01:31:24.480,spk_2,"My Lord, there are different ways in which one might have written the subsection to give effect to what was decided in Thompson v Elmbridge. What we say about that, is that that demonstrates that it wasn't the intention to produce the situation that Thompson v Elmbridge produced. Parliament never contemplated, in my respectful submission, that what would occur is that persons would remain in possession in a situation such as Mr Allen Austin for 18 years after a possession order had been made."
01:31:25.700,01:31:35.340,spk_1,"If you'd have said what I suggested, the date on which possession in order to be given, then that would have been clearly against you, and how would you survive"
01:31:35.340,01:32:11.660,spk_2,"that? Firstly, the difficulty would be that it wasn't fully against me, because the order in Mr Allen Austin's case didn't contain a date. So an issue would then arise as to whether you would infer a date, and itt may be partly that, in light of that, when the forms were reconstructed in 1993 and 2001, a date was inserted. Thompson v Elmbridge, in fact, develops the language of Section 82(2) to be that the tenancy ends on the date on which the tenant is to give up possession, either if there is a date on the dates specified in the order or if there is a condition on breach of the"

01:32:14.640,01:32:37.460,spk_1,"And I'm sorry to take you, hold you back from going to Knowsley, but I'm just wondering what your position is about Section 85(3) and the reference to mean profits and, Subsection 5, and we know Subsection 5(a) came in. Is it just simply, you say, well, that was redundant really? Is there any any other explanation we can give for the presence of these provisions?"
01:32:37.470,01:34:00.650,spk_2,"Yes, I can give an explanation, but that doesn't detract from my submission that they were redundant, and the reason that they are there is that the draughtsman of Section 85(5) imported the template from the Rent Act, Section 100 of the Rent Act 1977, which he was working from both in 1980 in 1985 was in almost exactly the same rubric as what is now Section 85. It included mean profits and it included having been amended the provisions in Subsection 5, both of which were entirely redundant in the Rent Act context. You couldn't order mean profits to be paid by a statutory tenant because a statutory tenant was paying rent and the possession order did not determine the statutory tenancy and therefore, Subsection 5 was redundant. However, without perhaps sufficiently thinking that through in the context of the Housing Act 1985, exactly the same words were imported, and when parliamentary counsel came to draft the Housing Act 1988 three years later for assured tenants, he again took the same template. So we ended up with three statutory regimes in all of which, we respectfully submit, the words mean profits were redundant. Took Parliament a long time to get round to dealing with that, but that was the case and that was held to be the case by the House of Lords in"

01:34:05.990,01:34:39.460,spk_2,"Well, if I may respectfully say so, it's a rather powerful point for my opponent in Knowsley. As will be recalled by this court, I was for an assured tenant in Knowsley and my opponents, one of my opponents best point was that well, the words mean profits and the reference to termination in Subsection 5 are in the assured tenancy regime must mean that the assured tenancy was determined, and that was dealt with by the House of Lords in relation to assure tendencies in the way that I'm inviting this court to deal with it in relation to secured tenancies. So"
01:34:39.460,01:34:49.440,spk_3,"you basically say about this point, these two provisions are redundant in both the other schemes, although they're there. So why aren't they redundant in this?"

In contrast with the 1988 act, Section 82(2) of the 85 act expressly identifies when a periodic secure tenancy is to end, namely on the date on which the tenant is to give up possession in pursuance to the order. It is not correct to conclude that 82(2) is redundant if the effect of 82(1) of the 1985 act which expressed in similar terms to Section 5 of the 88 Act, is that the tenancy ends on the date specified in the order. Thompson v Elbridge, Harlow v Hall. The decision in Thompson that the tenancy ends on breach of the term of the possession order is too long established to be departed from, and can be circumvented, Bristol v Hassan and Leatenhall.

The history eventually turned into a new prescribed form of order, the N28A which didn't include date. However, it was important to my case for that assured tenant to argue the case in the way I did on the basis of Section 82(2), and the question before Their Lordship's House in the Knowsley case was yay or nay, whether an assured tenancy ended on the date specified in the order or on breach of its conditions, just like a secure tenancy has been held to do or whether in fact, an assured tenancy survived until execution of the order. Lord Neuberger gives the leading speech, paragraph 28 of the report page 657. At paragraph 28,"
01:39:00.640,01:39:01.130,spk_1,"he"
01:39:01.130,01:41:13.020,spk_2,"says this. These three appeals raise questions about the effect of suspended possession orders on the status and rights of secure tenants under the Housing Act 1985, and assured tenants under the Housing Act 1988. Against that introduction, he then sets out the relevant statutory regimes governing security of tenure. I don't invite the court to read through all those descriptions now, but I would draw attention to the common feature, which he draws at paragraph 35. The protection afforded, he says, to protected, secure and assured tenants is affected through the medium of circumscribing the landlord's right to possession. That is the first of several common features between the three regimes and that is that security of tenure is achieved by circumscribing the landlord's right of possession. He then draws attention to the common way in which rent arrears cases are dealt with in Paragraph 37. And that is to say that in all three regimes, the landlord is required to make out a ground for possession and show that it is reasonable to have possession. Again, a common feature of the three, at paragraph 38, he draws attention to the fact that in all three regimes, the court is given very wide and flexible powers. In all three regimes, described as the extended discretion, and he lists those three provisions, Section 100 of the Rent Act, 85 of the 85 act, Section 9 of the 1998 act. He then reproduces those three sections at paragraphs 39, 40, and 41, and one can see immediately of the great similarity between the wording of the three of them. A further common feature he draws attention at paragraph 42 is that all three of those extended discretions contain subsections dealing with spouses and former spouses, indeed, in the same way. However, it's right to say that at paragraph 46, having described"
01:41:13.030,01:41:13.970,spk_1,"the approach taken"
01:41:13.970,01:42:38.750,spk_2,"under the later act, he does draw attention to the fact in the second part of paragraph 46, that the 1988 act has no provision expressly stating when an assured tenancy subject to a possession order comes to an end. In other words, Section 85 of the 1988 act has no equivalent in to Section 82(2) of the 1985 act. So he's there, having set out a range of the common features of the substance of the three statutory schemes, does draw attention to that distinguishing feature. He returns, however, to paragraph 47 in describing common features to the fact that all three regimes have provisions for succession to the tenancy on death. What approach then to take to statutory construction in relation to the schemes? I do invite this court to adopt the approach set out by Lord Neuberger in paragraph 68, particularly the last sentence, at the top of page 666. While normal principles of interpretation should not, of course, be jettisoned, the importance of the law in this field being substantially and procedurally clear and simple is cardinal. It is that approach, I'm going to invite this court to apply as his Lordship applied it to assure tendencies, now to secure tendencies."
01:42:39.850,01:42:43.070,spk_3,"What does cardinal mean? Just short of being the pope or what?"
01:42:45.310,01:42:52.600,spk_2,"I'm sorry, My Lady, I'm sure as My Lady is that what he was meaning there, is that it's a prime importance."
01:42:54.040,01:43:19.180,spk_3,"Yes, I found it quite difficult to work out what it means, that's why I asked. It was meant as a joke, as well, but I was asking because you don't-- Is it an overriding consideration? Or is it a background consideration when one is trying to make sense of what Parliament has done or what is it? Anyway, no matter, I don't find it easy to understand what cardinal means."
01:43:19.190,01:43:20.310,spk_2,"Yes,"
01:43:21.380,01:43:22.550,spk_1,"Is it going further than Lord"

01:43:31.830,01:43:36.500,spk_2,"can't recall whether I suggested cardinal or not, but I'm sure we can find out."
01:43:36.940,01:43:37.960,spk_1,"Maybe as an imperative."

01:43:45.380,01:43:47.120,spk_1,"it's slightly hyperbolic"
01:43:47.120,01:43:48.940,spk_0,"saying it's very important and obviously it is."
01:43:49.010,01:44:01.380,spk_1,"I think we can see your page 642, E and F. It doesn't actually include the word cardinal, you're really facing yourself on Lord Porter, I think."
01:44:04.510,01:44:05.100,spk_3,"Good."
01:44:05.600,01:44:09.390,spk_1,"Anyway, there we are. It's interesting."
01:44:09.870,01:47:18.530,spk_2,"Well, it may be difficult to follow or apply to suggest what I mean by it, and that is where one is coming to construe social legislation, it's important to identify what the principle is that is sort of being achieved by the statute, which is to say, the protection of occupation by tenants, and then to say, well, how should we approach the interpretation of that statute. Should we approach it as a strict property lawyer would or should we approach it in a way which is intended to be applicable by social landlords and their social tenants? And I hope that Lord Neuberger is there suggesting that you take the latter course. You try and find an interpretation which is substantially substantively clear and simple and procedurally so, also, it works, in other words. My Lords and My Lady, the question then posed for the House by Knowsley v White it is set out as the header to paragraph 69. When does an assured tenancy subject to a possession order end? Note, obviously not, when does a secure tenancy subject to a possession order end? Because there wasn't a secure tenancy case before Their Lordship's House in that series of three cases in which the issue arose. Although the other two cases were secure tenancy cases, the issue in that case, the issue in those two cases were not, as the issue is in the present case, what was the effect of Section 82(2)? There might have been such an appeal, but indeed that was compromised before the hearings. My learned friend suggests that it would have been an answer to the appeal in [inaudible] and Green, and no doubt he will develop that in the course of his submissions on this case. [inaudible] and Green, as the court, we'll see, was about the right to buy and the effect of revival of the tenancy. The analysis, then offered by Lord Neuberger at paragraph 69 onwards, starts with the Rent Act, the Rent Act provisions, which he deals with in paragraph 69 and 70, setting the history of how the approach to statutory protection was dealt with under the Rent Acts, and as this court well knows, under the Rent Acts, the landlord was free to determine the contractual arrangement by notice to quit, as My Lady has said, and then a statutory tenancy arose, but at paragraph 71, he indicates that the authorities suggest a position in relation to secure tenants under the 85 act is rather different. He refers to Thompson v Elmbridge, and sets out a passage from the judgement of Lord Justice Russell. He says that 72 that the correctness of this decision was not challenged in the argument befor the House in Burrows, where the issue is whether the new tenancy created by agreement between landlord and secure tenant against him, possession had been made. As neither party challenged the reasoning in Thompson, there was no contention that a secure tenancy only ended when the order for possession was executed. Disfair, if maybe a little defensive, to add that it suited both parties to accept the conclusion in Thompson. However, both Lord Wilkinson and Lord"
01:47:18.530,01:47:20.180,spk_3,"Johnson expressly"
01:47:20.180,01:47:58.730,spk_2,"stated that Thompson was rightly decided, and I've already indicated that with respect to Lord Neuberger, that goes a little too far, and Lord Browne Wilkinson, certainly in the passage referred to, does not expressly say that Thompson was rightly decided. He is in the passage, referred to, as I've indicated ready, referring to the submissions of counsel in Regan. At the paragraph 73 of the speech, he refers to the subsequent application of the Thompson principle and the fact that there have been tens of thousands of cases, subsequently, in which the Thompson proposition has been applied."
01:48:00.220,01:48:00.460,spk_1,"He"
01:48:00.460,01:48:04.240,spk_2,"then goes to the 1988 act, to deal with"
01:48:04.240,01:48:05.410,spk_1,"the"
01:48:05.420,01:51:00.940,spk_2,"assured tenancy regime, and he says at 76, leaving Burrows, Thompson, Hall and Artisan on one side. At the moment, I consider that on a fair and practical reading, the 1988 leads to the conclusion that an assured tenancy subject possession order does not end until possession is delivered up. We'll come to his reasons in a moment but it is again right to say at paragraph 77, that he draws attention to the fact that the 1988 act has no express provision indicating when an assured tenancy subject to possession order ends and he contrasts that with Section 82(2). May I take the court to the three reasons that Lord Neuberger gives for the conclusion that an assured tenancy does not end until possession is given up, because I shall respectfully suggest that all three reasons equally apply to the secure tenancy regime. His first reason. At paragraphs 79, 80, and 81, I summarise in this way. That there is no provision in the statutory regime to address the status of those in the shadow of a possession order. What he's doing at paragraph 79 to 81 is indicating that the statutory regime didn't contemplate people in limbo as a result of the possession order. Either they would be out or they would remain as tenants. He makes that point good, by reference to what's happened in relation to secure tenancies. He shows that there would be tens of thousands of people, in occupation for long periods, paragraph 80, and draws attention to the fact that although it can be said that this is a similar situation for long leases that have been formed until there's relief as it were, tenants in limbo, that itself is an archaic position. Proper application of the statute is that it had not intended that there will be people living in the shadow of possession order, who are not tenants. At paragraph 82, his second reason, that paragraph starts secondly, is that the invention of tolerated trespasses these people in limbo has led to difficulties, uncertainties as to their rights and as to the obligation of the landlord, and he finds that, and the difficulties he there describes inconsistent with the statutory regime, and his third reason, in paragraph 85 onwards, is that there is this very broad extended discretion that applies across the three regimes. He deals in paragraph 87 with the mean profits point and the spouse"
01:51:00.940,01:51:01.560,spk_1,"point"
01:51:01.840,01:52:33.200,spk_2,"and in paragraph 88 he says, in my judgement, Section 100 and therefore Section 9 contains more than one example of torrential drafting. Not only the references to mean profits unnecessary, but stay and suspend as anonymous as are discharge and rescind. Section 100 owes its origin to the1923 act, according, it must be construed bearing in mind its origins are based on a provision enacted at the time, when the drafting of the rent tax was not, as I have mentioned noted for their clarity. Having therefore found that there are those three reasons for holding back an assured tenancy does not end until possession is delivered up. At paragraph 90, Lord Neuberger says it is now necessary to face up to the point that this means that the effect for possession order under part 1 of the 88 act would be different from one under part four of the 85 act, as stated by this House in Burrows. As already explained, there is a difference between the 85 and 88 acts, in that the latter has no equivalent to the former Section 82(2), and it was the wording of that subsection which Lord Justice Russell primarily arrested his conclusion inThompson, and indeed in which Sir Andrew Morritt  rested his conclusion in Hall. Accordingly, although it would obviously be sensible and convenient that the pointed issue should be resolved in the same way under two statutes, I do not consider that logic compels that result. However, it should be added that I strongly suspect that if the point had not been determined in Burrows, I would have reached the same conclusion in relation to Section 85 of the"

01:52:34.270,01:55:07.520,spk_2,"is that which I've reached in relation to Section 9. There is a powerful post for saying that the date in which the tenant is to give up possession in pursuance of the order in Section 82(2) of the 85 act, can and therefore should mean the date specified in the warrant of possession, which is duly executed or acted on by the tenant. Furthermore, Section 121 of the 1985 act appears to me to be arguably inconsistent with the decisions in Thompson and Hall, in that it expressly appears to assume that a tenant who is, as well as those who will be obliged to give up possession pursuant to a court order would remain entitled to pursue the right to buy, and only a person as a secure tenant can have that right. Given that these arguments and indeed the point now at issue were not actually debated in Burrows, should Your Lordships reconsider whether Thompson and Hall were rightly decided. When that question was raised with Mr Luba, he replied with [inaudible], that, it was simply too late to take that course. Thompson had been assumed to be right, acted on from in many tens of thousands of cases in the past 20 years, more particularly since it had the express approval of the House more than 12 years ago. Further, by Section 299 and schedule 11 of the 2008 act, Parliament has amended and clarified the law so that secure and assured tendencies will only end when the order is executed. Although those provisions are not yet in force, when they come into force, they will largely only be prospective in their effect. In my view, we should not reconsider the view expressed by this House in Burrows, that Thompson was rightly decided so far as secure tenancy is concerned, the absence of any submission that effect from the bar in the face of discouragement from counsel highly experienced in the field. Wrong for this house effectively to go back on the previous approval of a longstanding decision which had been acted on a plethora of cases when there is in place, amending legislation having the same effect as such a reversal in which Parliament has decided to amend the law, only prospectively. Further, in Hassan, the Court of Appeal has approved a former suspended order for possession which would normally avoid the secure tenancy determining, unless and until the court makes a further order. And here I am like the bad penny, to invite this court now to do the task that I invited the House not to take in Knowsley v White, and that is to apply the logic that Lord Neuberger applied to Section 9 to the Housing Act of 1985, and to adopt a powerful argument, as he described it, as to why Section 82(2) should be read in the way that we have described."

There may be people for whom it is still advantageous to apply to the court under Section 85, to resurrect their old tenancy because getting their old tenancy back is better than having the replacement tenancy with the termination period only for some purposes fulfilled. Now, perhaps if I had a little more time to reflect and I shall take that time, I maybe be able to give a better answer to My Lord's question, but the existence of the replacement tenancy, which started by statute on the 20th of May, doesn't prevent the tolerated trespasser who gained the benefit of that replacement tenancy from saying, I don't want that, thank you very much. I shall apply to the county court under Section 85 of the act to postpone the date for possession in my original order. So I get back my original tenancy, thank you very much. Those people doing that will be people who have identified a difference between their old secure tenancy and their new replacement tenancy. What that difference might be is a little difficult to identify as a class. There may be some people who would be of benefit, but My Lord, I'll think on on that. If I may."

02:03:02.390,02:05:13.530,spk_2,"Yes, My Lord, it's identifying who they are, given that had Mr Allen Austin survived, he might have either got a replacement tenancy to which his brother could have then succeeded, or applied retrospectively to resurrect his old tenancy to which his brother could then have succeeded, and there will potentially be others who will want to revive their old tenancy, who are alive, and that's the advantage they have, and they will be able to identify what the problem is for them and act on it. This is a class who can't do anything if the interpretation of Section 82(2) is correct, as given in Thompson v Elmbridge because they're simply not addressed by the new statutory arrangements at all. And My Lords, I was suggesting that the first of the reasons why it may be necessary to revisit the approach taken by this House in Knowsley to Section 82(2) and the secure tenancy regime is because there is the significant class of which the present appellant is representative, who will have suffered grave injustice as a result of the construction that was adopted in Thomas. The second stage is that there is nothing in the new regime which can assist persons in that class, and furthermore, that the impact of assisting them by a more liberal construction of Section 82(2) will be exceptionally limited. There are likely to be, almost as every day passes, a great a diminishing number of failed successors who are still in possession. We've had failed successes since 1986, most of them will have left. Thirdly, there's never been the possibility contemplated of retrospective legislation for these people. The Parliament certainly knew that there were these people, but there's never been a proposal to address their situation. Only the proper construction of the old Section 82(2) can assist them."
02:05:15.490,02:05:17.400,spk_3,"That could be said to be a point against it. It could"
02:05:17.400,02:05:21.460,spk_2,"be said to be a point against me, My Lady. Yes, it could be said to be a point against me."
02:05:21.590,02:05:22.600,spk_3,"It is said to be a point against you."
02:05:22.600,02:06:50.000,spk_2,"It is said to be a point against me. What we can see, that the statue regime addresses tolerated trespassers that are still alive. It doesn't -- I t's difficult to see how they could have been addressed without out now, retrospective legislation. Such retrospective legislation is not needed if our construction of Section 82(2) is correct. The fifth point is that there is no justification for inconsistent treatment. We now have a situation as a result of Knowsley v White, where in the social housing tenancy sector. We have persons who were able to succeed after their deceased tenant broke the terms of the possession order and those who cannot. So the spouse of an assured tenant who failed to comply with the terms of a suspended possession order does succeed, but their neighbour, who is the spouse of a secure tenant, cannot. Let me then come to Mr Drabble's case that the situation has moved on, that the discourse should not now revisit the question because primarily Parliament has revisited it, and if I may in doing so, adopt also the alternative that a number of people have in the past acted"

02:06:51.350,02:06:51.830,spk_0,"I'm sorry, you dropped your voice, I didn't hear that."
02:06:52.420,02:09:26.450,spk_2,"I'm sorry, My Lord, there are two aspects. Firstly, Parliament has now addressed broad landscape, and secondly, there will have been people over the past 20 years who have organised their dealings on the basis of Thompson v Elmbridge and latterly Burrows. My learned friend's printed case first draws the distinction between the separate statutory regimes, the three regimes, and rightly identifies that the Rent Act regime is primarily concerned with the private sector. Inaccurately, however, it is suggested that the assured tenancy regime is also not concerned with the social housing sector. For the reason I've given, the assured tenancy regime is as important, if not more important now in the social housing sector than the secure tenancy regime itself. So it is wrong to say, as my learned friends do, that the distinction is between, on the one hand, the regime is applicable to social housing and the regime is applicable to the private sector. Secure and assured are applicable to the social landlord sector, in particular, the housing associations. Much reliance is placed by my learned friends on the fact the statutory position has moved on and it may assist the court if I offer a very brief chronology. February 2006, Harlow v Hall. Sorry February 2000? February 2006, Harlow v Hall decided by the Court of Appeal. That really, to use a colloquialism, sets the cat amongst the pigeons. In May 2007, the Court of Appeal in Knowsley v White decides that we have tolerated trespassers in the assured sector too. The combination of those two decisions produces at last a consultation exercise by the government which is launched in August 2007, and which concludes in November of 2007. My Lords and My Lady have the consultation document at volume 4, tab 52. I've just mentioned that from the paragraph numbers of that, the primary stimulus for the need to act is the situation of blameless tolerated trespassers, and I've described them earlier in paragraph 7 of the consultation."
02:09:26.450,02:09:31.750,spk_1,"And it's arising both from assured and secured? Both types of tenant?"
02:09:31.760,02:11:50.910,spk_2,"Both types if the Court of Appeal's decision in Knowsley v White was correct, which, as we saw subsequently it was not. And it floated the possibility of proceeding with the Law Commission's proposal in relation to the way of dealing with the future. It is right to say that the consultation paper recognised what was already well known, namely that the situation of many landlords and tenants was not well appreciated. Although it's been 20 years, the Court of Appeal had said that the tenancy ends on breach. Many landlords and tenants have not appreciated that, and the situation was one of real difficulty in the sector. The consultation closed in November 2007. The summary of responses was published in April of 2008, and My Lords and My Lady have that at tab 53. In short, the great majority of respondents, including landlords, wanted an end to the tolerated trespasser scenario. There was strong support for the proposition that tolerated trespassers should become tenants again, and the government decided to legislate in response to that as we see from paragraph 12 of its consultation document. It is striking that the respondents wanted the position changed even in respect of landlord respondents. The tolerated trespasser is described in the summary of responses by the relevant government department as being an unintended consequence of the legislation, page 17. As the court will appreciate, we respectfully adopt that proposition, that no one intended that the Housing Act 1985 or its predecessor 1980 act would produce limbo occupiers of council housing. The summary of the consultation, like all the other papers produced by the government, singularly identifies the tolerated trespassers as being the creation of the courts rather than the creation of Parliament."

In 2008, the Housing and Regeneration Act was passed by Parliament and, as is the modern way, the relevant government department was required to produce an impact assessment, setting out how it would impact on the sector. The impact assessment is again contained in the papers, which are before the house, before the court, and the relevant section of the impact assessment on the act, as opposed to the constitutional proposals, starts at page 281 of that document and the document is itself a tab 55, in volume 5."

02:16:30.390,02:16:31.430,spk_3,"In my"
02:16:31.430,02:18:00.000,spk_2,"respectful submission, that's wrong. Parliament had always been invited to give these tolerated trespassers replacement tenancies rather than their original tenancies back, and that's why we see the provision in the form that we do. In my chronology, I had reached December 2008 when Knowsley v White was decided in this court. By that date, schedule 11 had been enacted but not commenced. Commencement of schedule 11 was deferred in order to have a further consultation about a subclass, that subclass was situations in which the landlord had transferred its stock. So what do you do about a situation where landlord has limbo occupiers? But before the replacement tenancy regime came along, transferred its stock to a housing association, something of that nature. So there was a consultation exercise about that which delayed the implementation of the new regime. The commencement took place on the 20th of May 2010, pursuant to a commencement order, and most of the provisions of schedule 11 were brought into force on that date. 2009, surely not 2010. Yes, I'm sorry My Lord. In those circumstances, My Lords and My Lady, may we go to schedule 11 itself? It's in volume 4, tab 48."

02:18:25.880,02:18:30.440,spk_1,"really now looking at what appears in the amended form in the appendix, is that right?"
02:18:31.070,02:20:01.510,spk_2,"These are as it were, the amending provisions and the recipe you get is the filleted version of the 1985 in the appendix, but may I stay with the tab 48 provisions for present purposes My Lord, because I think the easiest way to deal with them. In schedule 11 Parliament decided to do two things. Firstly, to prevent the possibility of future creation of tolerated trespasses, and it dealt with that in relation to the statutory regimes as follows. First, it deals with this in part one, with reference to the Housing Act of 1985. The changes there are swept up in paragraphs 1 to 4, and the most important of all the changes in paragraph 2 of schedule 11, which restructure Section 82, and eliminate the wording of the old Section 82(2) and replace it with what are thought to be these clear words. The tendency may be brought to an end by the landlord, obtaining an order for the of the court for the possession dwelling house and the execution of the order, and for good measure, Subsection 2 now provides in the case mentioned in subsection 1(a). The tenancy ends when the order is executed, and on that wording, we may occasionally need to revisit My Lady, Lady, Lady Hale's judgement in a case called Dunn about the meaning of the words executed. But it's early days."

02:20:06.010,02:20:07.690,spk_3,"yes, My Lady."
02:20:09.020,02:20:13.260,spk_2,"So that's the Housing Act 1985 over the page."

02:20:14.330,02:21:08.410,spk_2,"notwithstanding that Knowsley v White had been decided, it was nevertheless decided to implement the amendments to the Housing Act of 1988 even though they were all now redundant as a result of decision in Knowsley v White. So paragraphs 5 through to 9 make the necessary changes to the Housing Act in 1988 for assured tenants which were once necessary perhaps, but are certainly not necessarily after Knowsley v White, and My Lords will see looking at paragraphs 1 through 4 of the first part of the schedule and then comparing them with 5 through 9 that what is happening is that in each case, the same changes are being made. We get rid of mean profits. We get rid of payments after termination. We get rid of the spouse provisions. All that goes because the tenancy does not determine until"

It was obviously not necessary to amend the Rent Act because under the rent acts, the tenancy does not end until the person is put"

02:21:33.390,02:22:25.760,spk_2,"Transitional provisions in paragraph 14 are important. They provide that subject as follows, this part of this schedule does not apply to any possession order made before the commencement date. So there is no retrospectivity of Section 82. The amendments thereof, however, 14(2) provides this part of the schedule does apply to possession order made before the commencement date. If the order applies to a new tenancy by virtue of paragraph 20, we'll come to that in a moment, or a tendency which has not ended pursuant to the order before that date. So if, for example, you were in the lucky position of being subject to a 28 day possession order, and before the 28th day, the 20th of May fell. Then the amendments apply to your order."
02:22:25.760,02:22:26.710,spk_1,"Or if there hadn't been a date and?"
02:22:26.720,02:23:39.580,spk_2,"Or if there hadn't been a date in the order or there hasn't yet been a breach. Paragraph 14(3) can be ignored because paragraphs 3(3) and 8(3) were not commenced, and I don't think we need anything further from paragraph 14. So My Lords and My Lady, the function of schedule 11 part 1, is to prevent their becoming any more tolerated trespassers, to the extent that that was necessary, as I've indicated Knowsley v White I dissented, you couldn't have them for Assured anyway. And, as we respectfully suggest, Burrows had wrongly decided to do for Housing Act 1985. The function of schedule 11, part 2, which is over the page, is to deal with those who were already tolerated trespassers, and part 2 makes provision for replacement of certain terminated tenancies. 15, in this part of this schedule, an original tenancy means any secure tenancy, assured tenancy, introduction tenancy, or demoted tenancy in respect of which a possession order was made before the commencement"

So it's right to say, as my learned friends are entitled to do that paragraph 15B accepts the premise that there can be possession orders, which have determined tendencies before the date of their execution, and indeed it may be said that this is entirely intended to reverse what has been understood to be the law, as decided in Thompson v Elmbridge and Burrows v Brent. But you can say, I"

02:24:41.640,02:24:42.600,spk_1,"shows that you"
02:24:42.600,02:24:43.390,spk_2,"can't really"
02:24:43.390,02:24:44.590,spk_0,"treat the 2008"
02:24:44.590,02:26:27.730,spk_2,"act as a guide to what the law was before then. Exactly, so I'm afraid that is a point I wish to develop. That point is right. The other feature of it is that the retention of the assured tenancy regime demonstrates the symmetry between the Housing Act 1985 and the Housing Act 1988 was intended to be retained. It would appear that Parliament decided it was worth changing the wording of the 1988 act in the same form as the wording of the 1985 act was being changed. No doubt because the same housing officers and housing associations were having to operate both regimes, thus demonstrating that it is important to treat two schemes as working in the same way. In our respectful submission, that was the position before these amendments but here we are, Parliament doing a belt and braces. Feet, i's paragraph 16 that creates the new tenancy, and it provides that a new tenancy of dwelling house, which was let under the original tenancy, is treated as a rising on the commencement date between the ex landlord and the ex tenant, if, and then it's a requirement that the home condition is met i.e. the tolerance trespasser has been in occupation and the ex landlord is entitled to let the dwelling house, and the further requirement is that the two parties have not entered to another tenancy after the date on which the original tenancy ended. Subparagraph 3 makes provision for the termination period, to which I referred in my earlier description. In this part of the schedule, the termination period means the period beginning with the end of the original tenancy and ending with the commencement date i.e. While"
02:26:27.730,02:26:28.640,spk_0,"he was tolerated trespasser."
02:26:28.910,02:28:52.290,spk_2,"Yes, that's right. If you ever were a tolerated trespasser, then the termination period is that period, the period for which you were in limbo. So paragraphs 15 and 16, telling us about the application and the operation of the new tenancy regime. The heading above paragraph 17 is nature of replacement tendencies, and it tells us in short order that if you were secure, you become a secure tenant. If you were assured, you become assured, etcetera, etcetera. Again, the references to assure all unnecessary unless Parliament intended to be treated as having thought that Knowsley v White was wrongly decided. 18, the new tenancy is subject as follows to have effect on the same terms of conditions as those applicable to the original tenancy, immediately before it ended. So you try and find out in a case like Mr Allen Austin's case what his tenancy terms were in 1987, and those are now his terms, and then at Subsection 2 the terms and conditions of the new tenancy have been treated as modified so as to reflect so far as applicable any changes made during the termination period to the level of payments for the tenant's occupation of the dwelling house. It's not quite clear how this works, but the intention seems to be that if the rent went up while you were a tolerated trespasser, then your rent from the commencement date will be the rent that a tolerated trespasser would have paid had they been the tenant. That's causing particular anxiety for those landlords who charged a different rent to tolerated trespasses and others, we'll come to that. Subsection 3, the terms and conditions of the new tenancy are to be treated as modified so that any outstanding liabilities owed by the extent of the ex landlord in respect of payments for the ex tenants occupation during the termination period, our liabilities in respect of rent under the new tenancy, and so with great respect to the draughtsman, it goes on because it's been decided that the way to deal with this is to create new tenancies and have a back period or a gap, you then have to make provisions like this as to what the nature of the new tenancy is and so forth, and what happens about the rent and arrears and that Parliament has sought as far as it can to do."
02:28:52.290,02:28:54.060,spk_1,"You're using rent to include mean profits?"
02:28:54.350,02:28:55.080,spk_2,"Sorry, My Lord."

02:29:06.740,02:29:07.940,spk_2,"Yes, but one of the great advantages if I'm"
02:29:07.940,02:29:09.850,spk_1,"right,"
02:29:10.730,02:29:16.790,spk_2,", we don't need this schedule at all."
02:29:16.800,02:29:18.680,spk_1,"That's"
02:29:18.690,02:32:25.190,spk_2,"not to say -- that that's not just, if I may say so, cheap or jury point. It really demonstrates what Lord Neuburger was saying. This is a fantastic piece of drafting in schedule 11, and if you have a wet towel and six hours to spend, you can in fact work out what a replacement tenant is and what rights they have, and so on and so forth, and this is all become necessary because it was decided that the policy of the 1985 act was that we would have things called tolerated trespassers in limbo and so on and so forth. Nothing better than schedule 11 could demonstrate why that shouldn't be held to have been the law. Paragraph 20 deals with the possession order because nothing in the new arrangements expunges the old possession order. So paragraph 20 creates an unusual situation in which, despite the fact you have a new tenancy, you are subject to the old order. So paragraph 20 provides the possession order in pursuance, of which the original tenancy ended is to be treated so far as practicable, as if it applies to the new tenancy. Any court orders made before the commencement date, which are enforced, relate to occupation dwelling, made in contemplation or in contemplation of consequence with the possession order are to be treated so far as practicable, as if they apply to the new tenancy. So it appears that the old possession order, to take a case like Mr Allen Austin's case, had he remained alive to the 20th of May 2009, that possession order would still be enforced. Section 21 then deals with continuity of tenancies, and it provides, the new tenancy and the original are to be treated for the relevant purposes as the same and as a tenancy, which continued uninterrupted throughout the termination period. So it is paragraph 21 that does the job that I was describing in my overview earlier. It provides that certain purposes you're treated as not having a gap, and the certain purposes are, A, determining whether the ex tenant is a successor in relation to the new tenancy. So you don't get a double byte because you had a succession while you were a tolerated trespasser and then a succession again. You're not treated as having a fresh start, if you were a trespasser, if you were a successor before you lost your own tenancy. B, calculating the qualifying period for the right to buy. C, determining the commencement date of the conditions set out in a particular ground for possession. That's to do with decanted tenants, and nothing turns on it. Or, D, any other purposes specified by the appropriate national authority by order. So, in other words, you can regulate for situations in which they will have an infill of the termination period, and then finally, Subsection 3 makes provision for proceedings on a relevant claim where the court may order the new tenancy and the original tenancy to be treated as the same and that is the discretion of the court to which I referred earlier."
02:32:25.920,02:32:26.650,spk_1,"That would be a convenient point."

00:00:49.730,00:00:57.410,spk_1,"My Lords, that and My Lady, that leaves me to make good two points in response to my learned friend's answer to our case on issue one."
00:00:57.530,00:00:58.790,spk_0,"The"
00:00:58.800,00:02:21.540,spk_1,"first objection taken by the respondents case at paragraph 21 to our success on issue one is that if we succeed on issue one, we would unpick arrangements which had innocently been made before the 20th of May 2009 by persons who relied on a Barrows and Brent and Thompson Elbridge and that would be potentially prejudicial. In particular my learned friends draw attention to the fact that some parties will have entered into wholly fresh tenancies as in fact is reflected by the terms of Schedule 11 themselves, which are dis-applied where a wholly fresh tenancy has been entered into. With great respect to the respondents, we say there is nothing in that point. It has always been possible for the tolerated trespassers to restore their existing tendencies. Section 85 has throughout been available. Assuming that we are wrong on our Section 82 point and the tenancy ended, what a person who has entered into a new arrangement has done is to effectively take the new arrangement in preference to the ability to revive their old rights. Put another way, the new agreement has worked a determination of the prospective revival of the old tenancy. We were unable to identify any prejudice that might result from that situation."
00:02:21.550,00:02:23.640,spk_0,"Is that a process known as novation?"
00:02:24.080,00:02:42.840,spk_1,"My Lord, it would be [crosstalk] -- terms, but obviously the tolerated trespasser is not giving up a tolerated tenancy, they're giving up their right to revive the old one. Yes. They're taking it a new tenancy in its place. My learned friend's second point is that there is now an elaborate"

00:02:43.970,00:03:07.640,spk_1,"in Schedule 11 Part 2, for replacement tendencies. And our success on issue one would upset, as it were, the statutory applecart in relation to Schedule 11 Part 2. May I offer the following responses. Firstly, Schedule 11 Part 2 purports to apply to assured tendencies"
00:03:08.450,00:03:08.640,spk_2,"to"
00:03:08.640,00:03:17.040,spk_1,"which, as we now know, it has no practical application. Prejudice would not be caused."
00:03:17.310,00:03:18.060,spk_3,"What?"
00:03:18.070,00:05:17.160,spk_1,"Would not be caused by saying that the provisions in relation to secure tenants likewise have no practical application. The effect of our success on issue one would simply be to demonstrate that, just as with the assured tenants, the secure tenants did not lose their tenancies. They have their original tenancy agreements. There might have been something stronger in my learned friend's point if Schedule 11 had shut out the possibility of applying for revival of the old secure tenancy. But that it singularly does not do. As we have seen from paragraph 20 of Schedule 11, it remains open to the secure tenant to apply for a revival of their old tenancy because the old possession order remains in place. My learned friend make much of the possible complications arising from the detailed provisions of Part 2 and the way in which they address particular species or aspects of the new replacement tenancy. I hope the quarter seen sufficient of Part 2 of the new Schedule 11 to realise that this would bring -- this new Schedule brings a host of new problems, difficulties and complexities [inaudible] causing further complexities and difficulties. Allowing our appeal on issue one will resolve those matters and produce the clearest possible solution to the position, that is to say, that the secure tenants will continue to have the original tenancies."
00:05:17.170,00:05:23.230,spk_0,"Really, the Schedule is pro non scripto. The schedule is pro non scripto, really, because it has no purpose."
00:05:23.240,00:07:15.720,spk_1,"It will still speak in relation to introductory tenancies and demoted tenancies, but it will not speak in relation to secure tendencies and assured tenancies because it need not. I remind the court of the point made earlier that ministers had no problem commencing the Schedule even though they knew much of it was redundant. This court would simply be deciding that a little more of it was redundant than the ministers had known at the time. There are indeed great advantages in taking the course urged upon the House -- urged upon the court w hen we take into consideration what Schedule 11 Part 2 in fact does. First of all, it would eliminate the unusual hybrid in Schedule 11 paragraph 20 of a possession order granted in respect of an old tenancy which continues to have effect after a new tenancy has been created. You don't need that if it's been the same tenancy throughout. Likewise, it will eliminate all the problems and issues that arise in relation to the termination period and what should happen about that gap. The respondent's printed case, indeed, appears to focus on the problems caused in setting aside, as it were, the way that Schedule 11 deals with the gap. But if there is no gap because we're right on issue one, then all those difficulties fall away. In short, we say there is nothing in the content of Schedule 11 or the fact of it's making that should inhibit this court from making the decision in relation to secure tenancies that the House of Lords made for assured tendencies in Knowsley v White."
00:07:18.280,00:07:18.620,spk_2,"Put"
00:07:18.620,00:08:36.620,spk_1,"that point a different way, we invite the court to recall that the key function of Schedule 11 is that it is needed to address unintended consequences of judicial interpretation of the 1985 Act, if albeit, intending no criticism late in the day, this court says that there is no judicial misinterpretation, Section 82(2) does not operate to require the tenancy determines earlier than the date on which possession is given pursuant to execution, then there is no problem which Schedule 11 needs to address. I'm afraid that as Lord Hope indicated before the short adjournment, I gave an incorrect paid reference earlier. I've have done so again in relation to different point. The reference to unintended consequences appears behind tab 53 in volume 4, not at page 17, as I suggested, but at page 7. The reason for my error will become clear as soon as any member of the court looks at page 7 where the printer's copy has left what appears to be a digit one. However, tab 53 volume 4,"

The Court of Appeal had reserved judgment in the instant appeal, and before that judgment was delivered, the House of Lords delivered its judgment in Knowsley v White. So, the court below did have the opportunity to consider that judgment to take account of it, but obviously it was not open to the court below to take the step that I'm inviting this court to take because they were bound by the decision in Knowsley v White of the House of Lords not to address the secure tenancy."

00:09:42.440,00:09:58.180,spk_1,"As approved in Burrows v Brent. It simply happened that after the argument on the remaining issues, to which I'm about to move, Knowsley v White was decided and for obvious reasons, it was thought sensible by the Court of Appeal to invite submissions about how Knowsley v White coloured the position."

At paragraph 21 bottom of page 71 she says, As to the law on tolerated trespassers, the House considered but rejected the idea that it should consider, reconsider the correctness of the decision in Burrows. As My Lord, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe put it, that decision had become too firmly embedded to be dislodged. I hope I'm not doing an injustice to Lady Justice Arden to suggest that that is not what, My Lord, Lord Walker was saying. I think"
00:11:03.720,00:11:07.900,spk_4,"I was talking about the phrase tolerated trespasser rather than the principle."
00:11:07.910,00:12:04.250,spk_1,"Exactly so, My Lord. Unfortunately Lady Justice Arden has read My Lord's speech as indicating that Burrows has itself become too deeply embedded to be disturbed. And I thought it worth drawing attention to that in case any member of the court feels it appropriate to draw attention to that misunderstanding of paragraph 4 of the speeches in Knowsley v White. My Lords and My Lady, finally, if we succeed in persuading this court on issue one, what then follows. What follows is that Mr Allen Austin would have been still a secure tenant at his death in February 2005. At the moment of his death, the secure tenancy he then held may or may not have vested in Mr Barry Austin, his brother."
00:12:05.970,00:12:06.420,spk_3,"Sorry, say that again?"
00:12:07.820,00:12:57.660,spk_1,"If he was still a secure tenant at his death, My Lord, in February 2005, then the tenancy may have automatically vested in his brother, Mr Barry Austin. The reason for the use of may is that the council, except that Mr Barry Austin is a brother but there is a prerequisite for succession that the successor must have lived with the deceased for a period of 12 months. And there has been no determination, yet, of that issue. So, a finding for the appellant in his capacity as prospective personal representative of the estate on issue one does not lead automatically to him becoming the secure tenant.

The question will then be whether Mr Barry Austin fulfils the conditions for succession and the way in which we would propose the court deals with that is simply to allow the appeal. The application made by Barry Austin in the old proceedings can then simply be stayed, and the issue of whether he succeeded will be determined in the possession [inaudible] that has been brought against him already and itself is stayed. That's assuming it can't be resolved. I should indicate, My Lords, that Mr Austin asked me to indicate that he intended no discourtesy this morning in repeatedly leaving My Lords court. He simply suffers a disability such that means he can't sit for a long period and it's for that reason that he's not returned this afternoon. It's my function to indicate that that suggests no disinterest by him in the outcome of the case. My Lords and My Lady, unless I can assist you further, that's our case on issue one."

Once Lord Justice Millett is not identified in Greenwich v Reagan that you could revive, and in particular Lord Justice Walker, I think, had used the phrase, Lazarus like, then it was realised that you could do this retrospectively and of course, that then spawned another lot of satellite litigation about whether the retrospectivity would regenerate the entirety of the past tenancy including the repairing covenant.

It will vest in a man's personal representatives after his death. Some rights are purely personal and die with the person, for example, the right to consent to the exercise of a power of appointment, but the question in every case is whether or not the right is personal and dies with him. If it is not personal, addressed in his personal representative. So, one is thrown back to the question, did Parliament intend the right to be purely personal? It has been held that prima facie, a right conferred on a man by statute, survives his death and that clear words are required if it is to be held that the right dies with the person who's been given that right. There are no such clear words in this case. Therefore, in my judgment, the right to give or withhold consent survives the death of the performer, and vests in his personal representatives."

00:25:24.590,00:30:27.190,spk_1,"It was so described by the Court of Appeal in this very context, that is to say tolerated trespass, in Jones v Merton. Can I briefly invite the court to travel there in volume 1 at tab 14. In Merton v Jones, volume 1, tab 14, the issue for the Court of Appeal, was whether a tolerated trespasser had to give notice to his former landlord that he was leaving the property. The Court of Appeal held that he did not. Paragraph's 89 of Lord Justice Wilson's judgment at page 1273, he puts the position in context and he says at the top of page 1273, a tolerated trespasser is a former secure tenant against whom an order for possession has been made in which the specified date for him to give possession has passed but which has not been executed. So, he has a valuable right, potentially to secure the revival of his tenancy. He then describes the three ways in which a person can be tolerated. Tolerated by consent, tolerated passively or tolerated because the court has restrained eviction. In paragraph 9, he indicates an estimate of 750,000 tolerated trespassers and he says at letter D, It seems that because of the chance that tolerated trespassers will secure a revival of their tenancies, many owners of public sector housing stock, however unwisely, omit to distinguish between their tenants and their tolerated trespassers. That passage going back as a matter of policies that were to points I was making on issue one. So, there we have the Court of Appeal identifying this right as a, quote, very valuable right. Can I then go forward in the judgment to page 1278 at paragraph 27 where he says this the fallacy of Mr Sefton- Smith's argument is yet more clearly demonstrated by reflecting on the feature, which principally confers upon the tolerated trespasser his distinctive status. It is the right to secure the revival of the tenancy by obtaining an order either for postponement of the date set by the order for possession, or even for the discharge or recision of the order itself pursuant to Section 85(2)(b) or (4) of the Act. The right is lost not only when the order for possession is executed against the tolerated tresspasser, as provided by 85(2), but also when execution is no longer required to give effect to the order, see the decision of the Court of Appeal in Dunn v Bradford. And that was a case in which it was said that execution wasn't necessary because the tenants have moved out and taken up occupation elsewhere. And the court will see that [inaudible] Lord Justice Wilson refers to My Lady's judgment in that case as to the meaning of execution of the order. What we get from paragraph 27 and the earlier reference in paragraph's 8 and 9 is that this is the critical right in relation to tolerated trespass, if there is such a thing, it is the right to re-secure revival, it is valuable and it is lost only when the order for possession is executed or when execution is no longer required to give effect to it. But, say my learned friends, nevertheless, this right is lost on death. Our first [inaudible] of that is it is a surprising submission in a scheme which envisages the secure tenancy itself surviving death. It might have been a stronger point had the scheme envisaged that a secure tenant loses everything on death. Would be then said, well, obviously, the former secure tenant loses everything on death. But this scheme doesn't determine rights on death, as we hope we have indicated in our printed case in our short summary at the beginning of how the succession provisions work. But there are other indicia in the statute which show why the right survives death. Firstly, the right to apply is obviously not confined to a person who is a secure tenant. It is available to a secure tenant,"
00:30:27.850,00:30:28.110,spk_2,"which"
00:30:28.110,00:31:38.810,spk_1,"is why I answered My Lord, Lord Browne, a moment ago in the way I did. Section 85 is not redundant in the case of secure tenants, it's available. But it is also available to former secure tenants, assuming that Section 82(2) has worked to determine the tenancy. Secondly, Parliament has itself prescribed, when the Section 85(2)(b) power should cease to be available. It has prescribed that it is available at any time before execution. The statute has therefore set out an express limiting feature. It could have set out other limiting features such as death, bankruptcy or any other feature that it sought to prescribe. And indeed, this is an Act which does address death and bankruptcy and so on in relation to provisions relating to the right to buy and indeed, in part for itself. Thirdly,"

00:31:49.920,00:32:01.200,spk_1,"Yes. The availability of Section 85(2)(b) is not confined only to the original former secure tenant."
00:32:07.950,00:32:24.070,spk_0,"I'm just trying to pick you up on that. I'm just looking at Subsection 3(a), which shown in the first line refers to the imposition of conditions with respect to the payment by the tenant of arrears."

00:32:25.800,00:32:52.360,spk_0,"And then I'm looking actually, at the appendix in 90 -- probably shouldn't be doing so, but there's another reference to tenant in the substituted Subsection 4. But that suggests, what, that this is available only in the case of the original tenant? You said just now it is available to others and the original tenant."
00:32:52.370,00:33:14.840,spk_1,"Yes, My Lord. I'm sorry. I ought to have been clearer. What is available is the ability to apply for the making of an order under Section 85(2)(b). I think, what My Lords put it to me is that if you succeed on your application under 85(2)(b) then 85(3) is triggered and the court shall then impose conditions with respect to payment by the tenant of the arrears of rent."
00:33:14.850,00:33:16.970,spk_0,"The word tenant is apt in that context."
00:33:17.380,00:33:20.110,spk_1,"It is in that context, My Lord, because it's referring to the arrears of"

00:33:32.740,00:33:34.390,spk_1,"The original tenant can apply."
00:33:34.570,00:33:35.190,spk_3,"Yeah."
00:33:35.250,00:36:02.070,spk_1,"The spouse can apply. 85(5), the former spouse. And as My Lords know it's our case that the executives of the deceased can apply. But that's the issue for determination. The references to the landlord's ability to apply are contained in Burrows themselves. Lord Jauncey at 1457 D to E. Unfortunately, referred to as Lord Browne-Wilkinson by Lady Justice Arden at 41, but nothing turns on that. What they -- what the landlord can do also is applied to restore. If that appears far-fetched, can I indicate a situation not very different from the present one. Firstly, a landlord may apply to revive precisely because it wants to rely on the obligations in the original tenancy agreement, at very lowest you shall cut the grass or something of that nature. But a landlord may also wish to make the very application that is made in this case to fix the succession of the tenancy. Take a case like the instant case. A one bedroom flat that's occupied by one man. And one bedroom flats are not in the highest demand in all local authority areas. The local authority might be quite happy to have the tenancy immediately go from the late tolerated trespasser to his brother. In those circumstances, it would apply for an order retrospectively reviving the tenancy. The great advantage that would have for the local authority is the successor would be liable for rent from the date of death of the late tolerated trespasser. And that's a great advantage for the local authority because it avoids all this problem about the tenancy first going into the estate and so on and so forth. So, even in this context, it can be to the advantage of the landlord to apply under Section 85(2)(b). In the course of answering My Lord, Lord Browne's question, I've made my final introductory point on the structure, and that is that the statute specifically envisages that the spouse or former spouse can apply whether or not the original tenant, now tolerated trespasser, is still alive. Our printed case, of course, develops these propositions."
00:36:05.780,00:36:06.010,spk_0,"We"
00:36:06.010,00:36:55.610,spk_1,"make I think, the point, that this has been taken so far that it had to be acknowledged that an application under 85(2)(b) can even be made where the identity of the landlord has changed. And that too may seem rather extraordinary that the landlord retains a possession order against X who becomes a tolerated trespasser, then sells the stock to somebody else. Even in that situation, the right to apply under Section 85(2)(B) to be endures. In short, maximum flexibility. The point on it applying even if the stock has been transferred, emerges from the case of O'Kane, which is tab 20, volume 2, paragraph 62."

It might be said against us, well, it's only protecting the occupation of the home by the tenant. But that isn't the case. This is a statutory regime that envisages transmission of the tenancy to other members of the family, either on death or by assignment. So, the statute contemplates the"

00:38:01.300,00:38:05.980,spk_1,"Yes, My Lord. I believe it has. Is My Lord looking at the version on the printer's copy? Yes I am [crosstalk] --"
00:38:06.270,00:38:15.650,spk_0,"I'm not sure if Section 91 is complete though, because we change pages from 46 to 62. [Inaudible]."
00:38:15.650,00:39:51.900,spk_1,"Yes, it is because all three of the exceptions are there. So, let me try and answer My Lord, Lord Browne's question from this is now page 46 behind tab 40, 42 of the bundle. Section 91 provides that in Subsection 1(a) secure tenancy, which is periodic is not capable of being assigned except in the cases mentioned in Subsection 3. And there are three exceptions, My Lord, I'll take them very briefly. 3(a), assignment in accordance with Section 92 which is assignment by way of exchange. You can swap your home with another social housing tenant if you get the consent of both the landlords and consent can only be withheld in certain circumstances. Yeah. (b), you can assign your tendency where a family court has ordered you to do that. For example, assignment from husband to wife on a divorce. And that provision, as My Lady would have anticipated has been greatly amended since it was originally introduced to deal with all the other situations in which a family court can order an assignment. And then Subsection (c), an assignment to a person who would be qualified to succeed the tenant if the tenant died immediately before the assignment. In crude terms, you can pick your successor. So, if you have three children living with you, all of whom could have succeeded you, any one of whom could have succeeded you if you died, you can during your lifetime assign to one of them and then they become the tenant. Those are the only three exceptions."
00:39:51.910,00:39:54.590,spk_3,"So, you can pick from the qualified successes?"
00:39:54.600,00:40:09.220,spk_1,"You can, My Lord. So, you can pick your children over your wife. You can pick between your wife and your other relations who are living with you. You could choose your grandmother rather than your partner or your children, provided that they meet the qualifying conditions."
00:40:11.010,00:40:12.870,spk_3,"And does that require consent? Do they all require consent?"
00:40:12.870,00:40:26.510,spk_1,"Only if it's a term of the contract, My Lord. I see. And even if it were, you could do it anyway, and then the issue would be whether the breach of the contract made ground for"

00:40:30.030,00:41:00.830,spk_1,"It's a particularly important provision, I say candidly to My Lord, Lord Browne in the context of prospective death, because it is a way of avoiding a ground possession for under-occupation. If I die in my four bedroom house, leaving one child behind and I do nothing in advance of it, that gives a ground for possession for under-occupation against my son. If, on the other hand, anticipating that difficulty, I sign to my son before I die, then the tenancy remains in my son's hands."

00:41:31.260,00:41:37.490,spk_1,"And of course, My Lord, all of those assignments have to be made by D in order to be valid."

00:41:47.840,00:42:18.620,spk_1,"No, My Lord. I think My Lord, Lord Browne was asking me about assignment in the context of the difference, perhaps, between that and succession on death. As I was -- the point I was making before My Lords observation is that this is a statutory regime that envisages transmission within the family and protection of the family and the home. And it protects the next generation, to use that crudely, in two ways. First, they'll succeed if I die. Secondly, I can pick them before I die. And both of those things are expressly dealt with in the statute."

00:42:29.890,00:43:02.600,spk_1,"Absolutely, My Lord. So that is why we're at issue two, can the estate of the deceased tolerated trespasser apply on his behalf for revival, which would then lead to the various rights being available again. Of course, Section 91 Subsection 3(c) wouldn't be available because he's already died. My Lord, we make any further small example of the advantage of being able to do this in our printed case, paragraph 48 in relation to claims."

00:43:18.010,00:46:20.850,spk_1,"But the very last point we make at paragraph 48 may require a little further explanation. I say there, it would produce a result in which the estate would take, for example, the benefit of prospective claim in nuisance that the occupier had accrued while a tolerated trespasser, but not the ability to revive the tenancy so as to be able to couple the claim in tort with a claim in contract. And it arises in this way, My Lord, it often happens that the tolerated trespasser, obtaining a revival of their tenancy, then makes a retrospective claim for damages suffered in the meanwhile. And the Court of Appeal has decided in a case called Pemberton that even a tolerated trespasser can sue in nuisance or trespass. And the estate may well wish to bring such a claim on behalf of the deceased, the deceased's estate, why not also, there is no logical reason why they shouldn't revive the tenancy so as to bring the claim in contract. So, My Lords, My Lady, for all those reasons, we say that there is no [inaudible] in the statute that this was intended to be only a personal right. How, then, did the Court of Appeal come to the contrary conclusion? My Lords and My Lady  have the Court of Appeal's judgment, obviously, in the appendix, and at paragraph's 23 and 24, page 72 of the appendix, the appellant's case appears to be getting off the reasonably good start, given that the Court of Appeal below accepted the approach taken in Knowsley, in particular in paragraph's 23 and 24, we see Lady Justice Arden adopting the purposes and practical construction to the legislation which Lord Neuberger had urged in Knowsley v White. But, and it's an important but, that the Court of Appeal held in the passages which start at paragraph 27 under the heading, Brent London Borough Councillor v Knightley, that it was bound by its own previous decision in the case of Brent v Knightley to hold that the right was a purely personal right. We see that expressed in paragraph 37 of Lady Justice Arden's judgment where she says, I now turn to my conclusions on Knightley. Subject to Section 3 of the Human Rights Act, this court is bound by the ratio of Knightley. I agree with Mr Drabble that it decides that the right to apply under Section 85 is a personal right which can only be exercised by the tenant. I think Her Ladyship means, or former tenant. But that's what she decided to be the position. She was bound by the ratio Knightley. So, I'm afraid in those circumstances, in this court, my attack has to be on Knightley because it is Knightley that the court below head was binding them to hold it was only a personal right. Can we then go to Knightley, please, which is tab 2 of volume 1?"

00:46:26.070,00:46:30.250,spk_3,"mean, it's pretty obvious that Lord Justice Longmore thought that Knightley was rightly decided."
00:46:30.350,00:46:34.170,spk_1,"Yes, My Lord, and whether he was bound or not, he would have reached the same conclusion."
00:46:34.180,00:46:38.880,spk_3,"Quite. Sorry, where's Knightley?"
00:46:38.970,00:47:43.450,spk_1,"Volume 1, My Lord, tab 2. My Lord, as is so often the case in this class of litigation, the issue now before this court didn't arise directly, initially, in that case. What happened was that the late Mrs Knightley was the tenant of the London Borough of Brent. On her death, the daughter, Janet Knightley, went to Brent and said, I succeed. And they said, No, you don't because your mother's tenancy was ended by a possession order. She, having been turned away, the council then applied for a warrant to execute the possession order and can I pick it up a page 860, we'll see what happened then."
00:47:47.820,00:47:48.190,spk_0,"This"
00:47:48.190,00:49:34.740,spk_1,"is the end of the first full paragraph, some five lines up. The respondents then applied for a warrant for possession. The appellant, that is to say, the daughter, applied to be joined in the application and the proceedings came before District Judge Cohen, who ordered that she be joined as a second defendant, that the warrant for possession should be stayed, the application by the plaintiffs believed to issue the warrant against the second defendant should be refused. Brent appealed. The appeal came before His Honour Judge Maher. He concluded that there was no lease in existence at the time the appellant's mother died, therefore, there was nothing to which the appellant could succeed. He therefore ordered, the order of district judge should be set aside. Ms Knightley's application for leave to be joined as a second defendant should be refused and the plaintiff should have leave to issue a warrant for possession forthwith. And the daughter appealed against that judgment. Two points to make immediately and invite the court to observe. First, Ms Knightley's application was to join herself to the proceedings. There was no application made in respect of the mother or by or for the estate of the mother. The daughter's application was her own application to join. Secondly, His Honour Judge Maher's judgment was delivered before the decision of the House of Lords in Burrows v Brent. And thus, it is that on page 860 Lord Justice Auld, after dealing with the history of the application, goes straight to Burrows v Brent, which has, of course, dealt with the effect of suspended possession orders. We can therefore pick it up, please, at page 862 where at mid page paragraph starts following."
00:49:34.750,00:49:36.040,spk_0,"Following"
00:49:36.040,00:52:04.810,spk_1,"the reason of the reasoning of the House of Lords in Burrows, the tenancy came to an end when the order of May 31st became operative. I should say this is a suspended order. It became operative on breach. They merely -- the orders for possession did not --suspension did not revive the tenancy, they merely postponed execution so long as the conditions of suspension were met and therefore, prolong the possibility of the tenancy being revived. As far as the appellant is concerned, there was at the date of her mother's death, no tenancy to which she could succeed. Having regard to the speeches in Burrows, Ms Morris, who appeared for the appellant, did not suggest that the tenancy subsisted at the date when the appellant's mother died. She submitted as Burrows made clear, that the tenancy was potentially continuous and could be revived and if revived, the tenancy retrospectively, was continued. She submitted that at the date when the appellant's mother died, it was possible to make an application under Section 85 to postpone the order for possession, which would have revived the tenancy. That, she submitted, by which one takes that to mean the application to revive, that she submitted, was an interest in the property which the appellant's mother possessed at the date of her death. The appellant had succeeded to that interest, both as her daughter and because she was like her mother, a tolerated trespasser, and was therefore entitled to apply for a postponement order and if so, the tenancy would arise -- would revive on her application. Those submissions are untenable. The right to apply for a postponement of an order for possession is not an interest in land capable of being inherited. Further, the right to apply under Section 85 is a right given to the tenant and in section --Subsection 5 to the tenant's spouse or former spouse. Section 87 also gives a right to apply to a person who is qualified to succeed as a tenant under a secure tenancy. That section only applies where there is a tenancy in existence. That was not the case here. To be a tolerated trespasser of the kind contemplated [inaudible] the person must be a trespasser tolerated by law. The appellant was not such a person. In my view, there is no right given to a person who Ms Knightley's position to apply to revive a tenancy and no tenancy existed at the time when her mother died. I conclude the appellant had no right and does not have any right in respect of the tenancy that existed between the respondents and the appellant's mother. The judge came to the"
00:52:04.810,00:52:05.700,spk_0,"right conclusion."
00:52:05.910,00:54:11.690,spk_1,"Appeal dismissed. Lord Justice Schiemann agrees and adds only this, The only possible way that young Ms Knightley could succeed here is under Section 89, which is the succession provisions. That section only applies where a secure tenant dies. Here, for the reasons given by My Lord, old Mrs Knightley was not a secure tenant when she died. That concludes the argument. I would dismiss the appeal. The first noticeable feature of that approach is that of course, it doesn't start where My Lord, Lord Hope, half an hour ago invited me to start, very properly, which is with the statutory scheme, in order to determine whether the right under Section 85 is a transmissible right or not. What Lord Justice Aldous appears to be doing is addressing the way in which the case was advanced to him by the daughter's representative. First, he holds, I'm looking at the passage is obviously at the bottom of page 862, first, he holds that the right under Section 85 is not an interest in land. Well, it's certainly a statutory right under Section 85(2)(b). The issue isn't coloured, in our respectful submission, by whether one describes it as an interest in land or something else. It is a statutory right. The question is, does it pass.  Secondly, the Lord Justice Aldous holds that the right to apply is given to the tenant and the spouse or former spouse only. And, as we've indicated, that's unnecessarily inhibited because it's given to the former tenant as well as to the tenant and it's also given to the landlord. Then, he adds, Section 87 also gives a right to apply to aperson who's qualified to succeed as a tenant under a secure tenancy. With great respect to His Lordship, that's simply not the case. Section 87 gives no right to apply to a person who is qualified to succeed. You've either succeeded or you haven't, and I think that is what the learned Lord Justice means by the following sentence, That section only applies where there is a tenancy in existence."
00:54:12.120,00:54:35.730,spk_0,"We hadn't actually looked in detail at Section 87 but it is set out in the Queen's printers copy, isn't it at page 44. Sorry? Page 44, Section 87. Sorry, I haven't quite picked up criticism as to [inaudible]. Yes,"
00:54:35.730,00:55:03.240,spk_1,"I'm sorry, My Lord. Let me make it again with the advantage which I should have offered all members of the court of having Section 87 open. Section 87's function is to describe those persons who are qualified to succeed a secure tenant. Yeah. That's its sole function, and it identifies those two classes as a spouse or another member of the tenant's family. Whether they succeed or not is determined by Section 89"

00:55:42.020,00:55:54.110,spk_1,"No, no, no. But I wouldn't wish the court if it decides that Lord Justice Aldous was in the right direction, to adopt that particular passage, because with great respect, it's simply wrong."
00:55:55.100,00:55:56.690,spk_3,"[Inaudible] Lord Justice Schiemann, simply, was putting it right?"
00:55:56.690,00:57:13.790,spk_1,"Indeed, My Lord, and that's the point. Lord Justice Schiemann was saying, you can succeed if your mother was a secure tenant. No problem. And she wasn't a secure tenant and therefore the daughter hadn't succeeded. The difficulty is that Lord Justice Schiemann is, there, not addressing the case, which is now before this court, which is, can the estate of the deceased apply? And therefore, the question becomes whether the court below in this case and the court in Knightley were right to decide that in this passage, Lord Justice Aldous had decided that on a true construction of the Housing Act 1985, the right of a former secure tenant to apply under Section 85 was personal only and could not pass on death. He was obviously right, in my respectful submission, to say that the daughter was not a tolerated trespasser. That must be right. No question could have arisen about the daughter being a tolerated trespasser. The only person who was tolerated trespasser was the late mother. But as seems relevant -- She"
00:57:13.790,00:57:23.520,spk_4,"was a tolerated trespasser only in the sense that if she was living at the flat with her mother, then she was a licensee, in effect, of a tolerated trespasser."
00:57:23.750,00:57:57.160,spk_1,"Exactly so. That's a correct understanding. And there seems to have been the suggestion that somehow she was entitled to apply for postponement because she was, herself, a tolerated trespasser and that can't be right. So she couldn't apply for revival as a tolerated trespasser. She couldn't apply for revival in her own right. So, the question became, could she apply for revival on behalf of her mother's estate? And that, with respect, is the question not answered by the passages which I've read from Lord Justice Aldous's speech."
00:57:57.170,00:58:11.270,spk_4,"I have an idea. I've read somewhere an assertion that in this case she was applying both on behalf of the estate and as a prospective Section 89. But I can't see a word in the report to --"
00:58:11.280,00:59:18.580,spk_1,"Because, My Lord, I think my learned friends get to that submission in this way. They rely on the words just above the paragraph starting, Those submissions are untenable. There is a line -- three lines earlier, The appellant had succeeded to that interest both as her daughter and because she was, like her mother, a tolerated trespasser. I think my friends invite this court to say that the words, succeeded to the interest as her daughter, mean that the daughter was the executor or personal representative of the estate of the mother and was making the application in that sense. I hope I don't do an injustice to my learned friends, but I think that's how they put it and I'm told by my friend he relies on the sentence immediately above that. What we rely on, of course, is that the application which the court was dealing with was an application to be joined as second defendant, not an application, as we're making, to represent the interests of the first defendant. That is to say, the true tenant or the original tenant."
00:59:19.020,00:59:27.270,spk_3,"Your submission is correct. I mean, they, Mr Trick, Ms Knightley and Mr Trick, and all she had to do was to apply on behalf of the estate."

It was misconceived to suggest that she was a tolerated trespasser enjoy the right herself. It was misconceived to suggest that she had it because she was a prospective successor. It was misconceived to suggest that she succeeded on the death because on the death the mother wasn't a tenant. In those circumstances, we respectfully suggest, the only way it could happen is if it had passed to the estate, that is to say, if the right to revive passed to the estate. But"
01:00:02.200,01:00:14.230,spk_3,"I mean, isn't that dealt with in the second sentence of the penultimate paragraph on that page? I mean, you say, obviously you would say it was wrong, but I mean, isn't it dealing with it?"

My Lord, may I respectfully concede this, that if he said the right to apply for postponement is not capable of being inherited, my position will be a much bigger -- be more difficult. But the reason for that and the reason I'm able to draw the distinction, is there's simply no argument and no reasoning direct to the question, whether there is a statutory right that can be transmitted on death. That's the point, My Lord. And for all those reasons, we say that Brent v Knightley didn't decide the issue in this case, and the Court of Appeal were wrong to hold that it did. But that doesn't get me home on My Lord, Lord Justice Longmore's judgement."

That is, it was not a claim by her estate. That's the only basis on which there could have been a claim to revive the tenancy."
01:01:43.300,01:01:48.370,spk_2,"Well, that's on the basis that only a restricted range of people can actually apply on the Section 85(2)."
01:01:49.050,01:02:21.330,spk_1,"Well, My Lady, that is right. You're being quite cautious is what I'm saying. Yes, My Lady. And My Lady is right to invite me to be a little more broad and not least because I make the point myself in the printed case that the court could do this of its own motion. So, it might be that the court itself seized of Ms Knightley's application could have said, well, I'll revive the tenancy retrospectively, and she succeeds. But that wasn't the nature of the case before the Court of Appeal. That's the point I better make and I'm grateful to My Lady for the qualification."
01:02:22.130,01:02:28.180,spk_2,"Well, there's nothing in Section 85(2) to say, who's got -- to say it's got to be done an application or to say who's got to make the application?"
01:02:28.190,01:02:34.360,spk_1,"Exactly so, My Lady. No. And indeed, that recognises, when I say so, the practical"

01:02:42.190,01:03:13.610,spk_4,"Yes and the practical reality, of course, is the sort of tenants who have great difficulty in paying their rent and on housing benefits are not in practice, on death, going to have any grant of representation to their estate. It's not going to be needed and it's only if the matter has to come to court, and it would then be, as in this case, not that there was a duly constituted personal representative seeking to come in, but the brother was seeking to be appointed to represent the estate simply for the purposes of those proceedings."
01:03:13.620,01:03:37.420,spk_1,"Exactly so, My Lord. That must be right. It's for that reason that where secure tenants die, let alone tolerated trespassers, the most common habit stance is that the tenancy devolves on to the public trustee, an unadministered estate by somebody who's died in intestate and the local authority then serve notice to quit on the public trustee.

01:05:19.480,01:06:25.080,spk_1,"Doesn't appear to do so, My Lord. No. With that rather unsure treatment of the decision in Knightley, at paragraph 54 and Lord Justice Longmore then goes on to develop his own view if the matter were at large and he does make a stab at Parliamentary intention. He says, Parliament plainly intended that the person who would otherwise be entitled to be -- to a secure tenancy, if it had been revived should not be able to apply to revive it in his or her own name. Parliament plainly intended that the person who would otherwise be entitled to a secure tenancy if it had been revived should not be able to apply to revive it in his or her own name. Well, it's difficult to see that sentence the context of the next, To hold that the deceased's estate can apply to revive it for the purpose of enabling that person to obtain a secure tendency, will be to circumvent if not flout that intention by means of illegal device. With respect, it's a little difficult to follow."
01:06:25.310,01:06:40.160,spk_3,"I mean, is that a reference to 70 -- Sorry 87 and 89's use of the concept of succession on death of a tenant, period? I mean, I think that's what it must be referring"
01:06:40.160,01:08:22.430,spk_1,"to. Absolutely right, My Lord. Insofar as Lord Justice, Longmore is seeking to say, the statutory regime for succession provides for succession to secure tenancies, he's obviously right. No difficulty about that. But this isn't a case about succession. This is a case primarily, about the right to revive the old tenancy. If the old tenancy revives, then it follows as night follows day, that there will have been a succession. So, I've got no difficulty with the provisions of Sections 87 to 89. The question is, is there anything in the statute which prevents the possibility of the estate of the former secure tenant making the application after their death? And for the reasons we've given already, we say that that is not so. Indeed, My Lord and My Lady, my learned friends have to go this far. They have to show, they have to say, that the right determines on death, even though the former secure tenant may be in the course of exercising it, because my learned friend's case is that it is death, the instant there of, which shuts out the Section 85(2)(b) application. So, as our printed case indicates, you may have a tenant who has woken up late to the fact that they need to apply to revive their tenancy, who is in the course of doing that very thing on their way to the court at the court. Perhaps, they've had their hearing and the matter has been reserved. My learned friend's cases is well, if they die, that's an end of it. The application to revive cannot be pursued because your rights fall away at your death."
01:08:22.440,01:08:31.069,spk_3,"I mean, it's probably not a very helpful intervention, but that wouldn't be unique. If you bring a libel action and you die in the middle of it all before judgment or -- that's it, isn't it?"
01:08:31.069,01:09:01.310,spk_1,"My Lord, it is in part, because certain causes of action are reserved to determine on death. But here we have a statutory scheme, and the question is, does this statutory scheme provide for loss on death? And it's remarkable that it doesn't for the two reasons I've already given. Firstly, it does deal with death in other circumstances, and secondly, it does provide a delimiter, which is that you have to apply before execution. Having done those two things, in our respectful submission, it goes too far to say, Oh, and it also meant that you can't do this after death."
01:09:03.160,01:09:11.779,spk_3,"I mean, could it be said that by the same token, you don't need execution if you vacated, you don't need execution if you die?"
01:09:12.069,01:09:25.250,spk_1,"Well, there may be a basis for saying that if there's no one in occupation, but in this case there is somebody in occupation, as there will be in all these prospective successor cases ad you do need to execute to get the prospective successor out."
01:09:26.980,01:09:40.410,spk_4,"You've refrained from making any reference to Section 90 a secure tenancy of a term certain. I know that's a very, very unusual case, but does that help you in any way?"

01:10:15.420,01:10:47.730,spk_1,"Yes, My Lord, the purpose of Section 90 is to make provision for devolution of fixed term tenancies, having addressed in Section 89 only the devolution of periodic tenancies and only applies where the term is for a term certain. And it makes provision for the disposal of the tenancy in the course of the administration of the tenancy estate. As indeed, does Subsection 3 of Section 89, in respect of the disposal in the course of the administration --"
01:10:47.740,01:11:22.880,spk_4,"It contemplates that usually, the tenancy then will stop being a secure tenancy but if there is a successor under Section 85 and 80 -- sorry, under Section 87 and 89 if I understand it right, then that term would continue as a secure tenancy and end up with the successor. And there would, I suppose, be the possibility of a Lazarus order being sought in that situation as"
01:11:22.880,01:11:47.330,spk_1,"well. I have to be careful about that, My Lord, because Section 89 only operates in relation to a periodic tenancy and therefore Section 89(2), transmission by a successor, can only work where the tenancy is periodic. Section 90 is making provision for fixed term tenancies [crosstalk] --"

So, your fixed term tenancy can end up with a successor in the same way that your periodic tenancy could, in the sense of the same target group of people end up with it."

That goes in, as a tenancy, goes into the estate, but it stops being a secure tenancy unless by the rules of the devolution of the estate, it goes to somebody who's qualified under Section 87. Yes, My Lady. And it's then up to the landlord whether they decide actually to bring the thing to an end. They could still continue as a contractual tenancy couldn't it?"

This is a statutory regime where death doesn't end the tenancy, either in its contractual sense or in its statutory sense. The statutory position is that secure status can be maintained if a periodic tenancy passes to a successor, person qualified to succeed, or if a fixed term tenancy passes to a person qualified to succeed. In either case if that fails, the tenancy remains alive and it passes but as an unprotected tenancy, which can then be determined by a notice in the appropriate"

And I'll deal with it briefly, if I may, by advancing four very simple steps of propositions. Proposition one. We say the right to reply to revive, Section 85(2)(b), was a possession of the late Mr Austin, for the purposes of Article 1 Protocol 1."

01:15:49.010,01:16:07.660,spk_1,"Absolutely none of this has anything to do with human rights of Mr Barry Austin. If he has any human rights, they're going to arise in different context. This is all about Mr Allen Austin's rights. The late Mr Allen Austin's rights. And the first question is whether the right that he had before he died was a possession."
01:16:08.510,01:16:08.590,spk_2,"I"
01:16:08.590,01:17:16.940,spk_1,"understand that my learned friends say it wasn't, we say it was. Secondly, in our second proposition, is that a judicial construction of the statute which holds that that possession did not survive death, would amount to an interference with that possession. [Pause]. Our third proposition is that such an interference cannot be justified. Won't develop for the purpose of My Lord's note that we mean justified in the context of Article 1 Protocol 1. And our fourth proposition is that accordingly, the statute ought to be construed as not having the result of breaching the Convention i.e. by holding that the right passes on death to the estate. I do not shy from the fact that there is a certain circularity, here. [Laughing]."
01:17:18.480,01:17:20.860,spk_2,"You could see us all poised [inaudible]."
01:17:21.120,01:17:47.780,spk_1,"No, no, My Lord, I have the benefit of Lord Justice Longmore telling me in his judgment that he couldn't understand what I was saying so let me make it absolutely clear. My primary case on this aspect, did it pass the estate, is that on the true construction of the statute it did pass to the estate so we don't need issue three and four. But if there's any question or doubt as to whether it did or it didn't, then we deploy Section 3 of the Human Rights Act, the reading of statutory provisions compatible with the Convention,"
01:17:48.340,01:17:48.540,spk_0,"and we"
01:17:48.540,01:17:56.720,spk_1,"can only do that if we're in the territory of Article 1 Protocol 1. It's for those reasons that I developed those four propositions. But"
01:17:56.720,01:18:10.610,spk_2,"there are lots of things which are possessions while the recipient or entitler person is alive but cease on death. There are lots of  them. Benefit entitlements being the obvious one."
01:18:10.610,01:19:01.490,spk_1,"Large number of contracts and so on and so forth. What we have here, is a rather unusual creature. A statutory right to obtain the revival of one's previous tenancy. That's a question of whether that determines on death, My Lady, and we invite this court to answer that question, in so far as it were conventional interpretation of the statute doesn't allow it to be answered in our favour, by deploying the guidance given by the Convention in Article 1 of the First Protocol saying, Well, look, there's two possibilities here. Either it's to be taken away on the incidence of death, in which case we say that's a deprivation or interference. can't be justified. Or alternatively, it's not, in which case you don't need to add anything further from Europe. The question is whether Section 3, the interpretive obligation, enables the court to answer the question if it remains in doubt."

01:19:02.060,01:19:06.260,spk_1,"deprived? Who is being deprived? It can only be the late Mr Austin."
01:19:06.430,01:19:15.200,spk_0,"I'm wondering whether, maybe a silly question, but what is the first paragraph of Article 1 Protocol 1 talking about when it talks about a natural legal person?"
01:19:15.210,01:19:25.990,spk_1,"Yes, My Lord. It must, because of the way I put my case on this point, be the late Mr Allen Austin, who, My Lord, is now going to say, ceased to be a natural person when he"
01:19:25.990,01:19:27.200,spk_4,"died. [Laughing]."
01:19:28.230,01:19:55.450,spk_1,"Indeed he did. The question is whether his right while he was alive is interfered with by holding that it cannot be transmitted on his death. It's rather the same as saying you have a house or you have money at the moment it is yours, but we're going to take it away when you die. And the question is whether that would be an interference with your present possession for the Article 1 Protocol 1 purposes. And we say that such a decision would be an interference with your enjoyment of your possessions."
01:19:56.100,01:20:35.050,spk_2,"Is the question of justification, supposing the first part of your argument is correct, is the question of justification a general one or an individual one? Normally, justification would be looking at the individual action in relation to the individual person deprived. But it sounds to me as if you're looking at whether the interference that would come about through a particular interpretation of the statute is the thing that can't be justified. In other words, a generalised inability to justify which rather sounds like declaration of incompatibility terms rather than --"
01:20:35.250,01:22:01.650,spk_1,"That sort of territory? Yes, My Lady, I accept that if I may, and so often these two things colour each other. It is the fact that this is going to be the result of the individual case that suggests that the provisions, if applied in that way, would be unjustifiable. I'm content and I take this very briefly to deal with justification on the simple scenario of this case. If we -- if Mr Allen Austin had at the date of his death a possession, that is a right to apply to the court for revival of his tenancy, and if it was lost on his death, then extraordinary consequences follow, which with respect, we say can't be justified. And they are, as follows, and I'll deal with very briefly by list, if I can. Firstly, the tolerated trespasser regime which would have produced this result was no part of the intended statutory landscape. And that's true whether I win or lose on issue one. Secondly, those affected by it both landlords and tenants are largely in ignorance. Thirdly, the right was held in this case by Mr Allen Austin for 18 years and could have been exercised within that time by him with no difficulty."

01:22:17.640,01:22:27.360,spk_1,"It's right to say that he hadn't cleared it, My Lord, and that the arrears at the date of his death would have been a significant but not the amount that was started with."

01:22:42.610,01:22:48.530,spk_3,"say the right here could have been exiled at anytime, I mean, I was getting the inference that he could have just walked to"
01:22:48.530,01:23:21.930,spk_1,"court and got what he wanted. He could have walked to court and made his application. That's the point. And it's that opportunity which has been deprived of. But that makes me -- takes me to my fourth point, My Lord. The judicial judgment which falls to be exercised, is the same, whether he's alive or dead, and that is, whether his old tenancy should be revived. If he'd applied while alive and succeeded"
01:23:22.610,01:23:22.760,spk_2,"in"

01:23:24.860,01:23:54.360,spk_1,"his brother would have succeeded to the tenancy. All that is being sought is the opportunity for the application to be made in his interests after he's dead by his estate, which, if it succeeds, will produce the same result. And there's no particular policy reason for why a distinction should be drawn based on the fact of his death. The issues for the consideration of the court will be the same."
01:23:56.680,01:24:06.860,spk_3,"I mean, is this question as to whether it would have been a successful application also a reserved question. I mean, it's reserved as to whether, in fact, your client was a potential successor, whether he had actually"

01:24:07.980,01:24:22.760,spk_3,"a year or more together with his brother, wasn't it in a one bedroom flat? That's one reserved issue. But is it also reserved as to whether, if he was succeeded in this place, he would have succeeded in his application and."
01:24:22.770,01:24:41.430,spk_1,"Absolutely, My Lord, in two senses. Firstly, there's no concession by the respondents that he would have succeeded. And secondly, we've never got to that stage because at each of the courts below, we've been shut out in our ability to be joined to represent him. So, there's been no substantive consideration of the application at all. What"
01:24:41.430,01:25:19.830,spk_0,"about the second paragraph of Article 1? I'm not absolutely sure whether this is part of Mr Drabble's case, but he does say that it appears that Parliament has deliberately excluded those mentioned under Section 85 and what the second article -- second paragraph talks about is provisions, laws deemed necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest. [Inaudible] this is social housing and if the occupation comes to an end and the house becomes available for others on a housing list, which may be very long and stretched and so on, is there an answer to that point?"
01:25:19.840,01:26:25.930,spk_1,"Yes, and I hope I've already made it, My Lord. The statutory scheme could have control of this matter expressly. Yes. And said, This right does not survive your death. Not only did it not do so, but it imposed a different limiting condition, that is, that it is available at any time before execution. And secondly, it did so in a statutory context which already provides for the transmission, not on the basis of need to a different member of the household. And I hope I've made that case good by the examples I gave earlier in relation to succession to a large house or the ability to organise one's affairs by assigning to a particular member who might have succeeded. My Lords and My Lady, that leaves only issue five, which is whether, assuming that we succeeded on any of the other matters, the court had jurisdiction"

I may have misunderstood my learned friend's printed case, but I think I have deduced that if we succeed on issues one and two in particular, three and four, if available, that there isn't an objection on this part of the case any longer. I may have misunderstood and obviously give way to my learned friend on that matter, but it appears from paragraph 3 of his printed case, that he says that if we succeed on issues one and two, and three and four, then there is a discretion in the court."

01:27:51.100,01:28:57.610,spk_5,"were both correctly decided, and in particular, we maintain that they were plainly correctly decided unless this court is willing to overturn the line of authority, which includes Thompson v Elmbridge and Burrows v Brent. And as far as that line of authority is concerned, I don't shy away from the proposition that our main emphasis is that this line of authority is simply too well entrenched in the sense of having been followed by a very large number of other cases and by the very carefully considered provisions of Schedule 11 in the 2008 Act, to be overturned in this way. For reasons which I shall explain, a simple reversal of Burrows would destroy the whole mechanism of paragraph -- of Schedule 11. It would rid it of any content. And in our submission --"
01:28:57.620,01:29:00.320,spk_3,"Well, it would make it simply unnecessary, I mean that's the point. Well,"
01:29:00.320,01:33:02.970,spk_5,"I understand that, and I'll come to you on why that's a bad thing in just a moment. But the situation -- the history when I'm going to just set out [inaudible] just remind ourselves again what the history is. Thompson v Elmbridge was decided in 1987. It's now some 22 years old. It spawned a further line of authority, of which, one important example, which is important in the context or Schedule 11, is Lambeth v Rogers dealing with the situation in which a court would exercise its discretion to revive a tenaency for the purpose of creating a cause of action, in what has now become  the period recognised the Schedule [inaudible] 11 as the, limbo period. So, we have Thompson v Elmbridge. We have a very large number of authorities at the Court of Appeal level which followed Thompson v Elmbridge including, for example, Lambeth v Rogers. Thompson v Elmbridge was expressly followed in Brent v Burrows. Whilst I accept that the point that's between myself and Mr Luba was not argued in Brent v Burrows, both parties starting from the common position that Thompson v Elmbridge was correctly decided. The effect of H22 is the very foundation of the reasoning both of Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Jauncey in Brent v Burrows, and in our submission Brent v Burrows ought to be treated as authority of the House of Lords, which positively decides that Thompson v Elmbridge was correctly decided. And accordingly, in my submission, Mr Luba is inviting this court to depart from an earlier considered decision of the House of Lords. Even if that puts it too highly, he is certainly inviting this court to depart from a decision of the House which has been treated, as he himself says, as having determined this issue as far back as 1996. The history then includes further developments of the [inaudible] of the consequences of tolerated trespassers. In particular, the Court of Appeal decision in Hasan, which my learned friend took the court to, which set out in paragraph 34 a list, I think, of 9 alleged difficulties arising from this established line of authority. My learned friend accepts that that led to a elaborate consultation process which my learned friend has described, which in itself, led to the 2008 Act. The 2008 Act being in the process of in the legislative process at the time of both the Court of Appeal decision in Knowsley and the decision of the House of Lords in Knowsley. As I hope I can demonstrate, the result of that consultation process was a deliberate decision not to reverse Thompson and Burrows retrospectively, but instead, to devise a machinery which reversed the adverse future effects of the line of authority as they were perceived --"
01:33:03.410,01:33:03.980,spk_1,"Machinery"
01:33:03.980,01:33:04.390,spk_3,"to do what?"
01:33:04.780,01:35:42.390,spk_5,"To reverse the adverse future effects, is what I said. The adverse future effects of the line of authority as they were perceived whilst protecting landlords from the consequences of a fully retrospective reversal of the decisions. And what my learned friend is inviting Your Lordships to do, despite the fact that Knowsley -- in Knowsley, the House of Lords, considered whether or not to reverse the line of authority with full retrospective effect and decided not to, my learned friend is now inviting the court in the very last dying days of the regime to reverse it, in a way which will undermine the safeguards Parliament has thought appropriate to enact on the assumption that the line of authority was well established and have been acted on by very many individuals and councils in the years since Thompson v Elmbridge. And we do say that although the Practice Direction of the House of Lords, which seems to govern the following, in board terms, by the Supreme Court in these circumstances, recognises that the House could depart from previous decisions, the Practice Direction places emphasis on two particular factors, says that the rigid adherence to precedent may lead to injustice and in particular case and also unduly respect to the proper development of the law. They propose, therefore, to modify their present practice and while treating former decisions of the House as normally binding, to depart from a previous decision where it appears right to do so. I take it that members of the court are familiar with the Practice Direction. We have copies if it's necessary to provide it. The part I emphasise, is the need to to protect the proper development of the law. In our submission, a decision at this very last minute, the matter having been considered and thought about in Knowsley to overturn Burrows, will lead to a massive difficulties about how Schedule 11 is to be applied. And Your Lordships aware already from what Mr Luba has correctly said about the consultation process, that there was a very elaborate consultation process."
01:35:45.640,01:35:53.430,spk_0,"So, presumably you're coming back to explore that more fully Mr Dabble, because I'm not sure I fully appreciate all these difficulties."
01:35:53.610,01:36:02.170,spk_5,"I think maybe it might be sensible, slightly out of the order I intended to, but to take Your Lordships and My Lady now to Schedule 11."
01:36:02.180,01:36:07.990,spk_0,"I don't want to disturb your order at all. I was just checking that this is a summary of what you're going --"
01:36:08.160,01:36:52.610,spk_5,"Absolutely, it is. We have two themes for on the first issue. The first is that a submission -- logically, the first, anyway, is a submission that Knowsley and Burrows were decided on the basis of what we still say, is the natural construction of Section 82 in particular, Section 82(2), the construction that Thompson v Elmbridge  put on the language of Section 82(2) is the natural construction, the strained construction to achieve any other results. I'll try and make that good. But it's not my primary case that no other construction is possible"
01:36:54.850,01:36:55.130,spk_1,"or"
01:36:55.130,01:37:15.510,spk_5,"would have been possible, as Lord Neuberger put it, had the matter been argued much earlier. Our primary case is that it would be far from leading to the orderly development of the law to reverse it at this very last moment."
01:37:19.410,01:37:19.600,spk_0,"I"
01:37:19.600,01:37:43.790,spk_5,"make that submission primarily on the basis of the 2008 Act and the consultation process which has led to it. And it may be sensible to go immediately to Schedule 11 to make good that proposition and to some guidance which explains the thinking of the department behind Schedule 11. Can I"
01:37:43.790,01:38:39.410,spk_0,"ask just before you go there, can I just put a point on the application of the 1966 Practice Direction. You may recall, I don't know whether you do, the case of Hall v Simons, which dealt with the immunity of barristers. That was, that was a judge made rule, which was thought, when the matter was reviewed in 1996 or thereabouts, was thought to had outlived it's usefulness or really to be out of touch with the way matters had developed. It maybe, although Mr Luba hasn't put it this way, that when you look at what has been going on, there's this residue of what has been left from a judicial interpretation of the statute which has created difficulties which is more prone to being set aside by judicial decision because it was itself the creation of a judicial decision."
01:38:39.420,01:40:36.480,spk_5,"I follow that. But the true analogy with that position will be the overturning of Rondel v Worsley at a position when Parliament had legislated a framework under which barristers could be held liable, which didn't go as far as the full common law reversal. Now, that's the true parallel, because when we get to Schedule 11, Schedule 11 very, very carefully does not reverse Burrows with full retrospective effect. It does so -- sorry, it doesn't do so, because representations were made in the consultation process, the position of landlords in the interim period ought to be protected, and one of the facets of that that's easy to understand is that whereas a full reversal of powers would revive -- not revive, would prove that repairing covenants have been in place throughout so that no question of discretion would arise, the statutory scheme under Schedule 11 deliberately mirrors Lambeth v Rodgers that is confirms that the judge has a discretion as to whether or not to direct that the tenancy is to be treated as a tenancy which has existed throughout the limbo period and the guidance issued by the department emphasises that that discretion -- sorry, indicates that the department envisages that that discretion will be exercised in the same way that Lambeth v Rodgers envisaged. Now, the simple reversal of Burrows just destroys that, and it may be sensible just to say early on why that is the case. If I can"

The [inaudible] or something like that, where there had been decisions that held that you couldn't establish a right of way by a usage that was, in fact, contrary to byelaws. So, these people who had to drive along tracks to get to their houses happened to be contravening a some sort of provision. I think a byelaw. And it was held that they couldn't therefore establish any sort of right away, which meant, of course, the owner of the land could extract large sums of money from for the grant of the land. Parliament had in fact recognised this difficulty, consulted about it and legislated on the basis that the earlier decisions were correct. Admittedly, they weren't decisions in the House of Lords they were, I think, decisions of Court of Appeal, and so we in the House of Lords were confronted with, what do we do in that situation? It's the closest parallel that I can think of [crosstalk] -- it was a very recent consultation and very recent legislation, rather like this. The"
01:42:44.930,01:42:55.450,spk_3,"deal was, you could pay some pretty modest sum to acquire the right but the earlier authorities said you didn't have. So, the House of Lords then decided you did already"
01:42:55.450,01:43:08.680,spk_2,"have. And so no payment was necessary. That's right. I was thinking that too. I just thought I'd draw it to your attention, everybody's attention, as being a case in which the House of Lords did such a thing."
01:43:08.690,01:46:04.310,spk_5,"Yes, this will be an extreme example of that approach because we have the House of Lords decision in Burrows where admittedly, the issue isn't raised, but The House of Lords plainly considers Thompson v Elmbridge to be could be correctly decided. We have Knowsley, in which the issue is not raised in the sense that I think I was the one that was representing the secure tenants and could have taken the point and it would have been a complete answer to the two cases in which I appeared. We won on other grounds. And Mr Looper, I think, having indicated that he didn't think of it appropriate to take the point, I was [inaudible] enough to agree and didn't. But we do have a recent House of Lords case which deliberately decides not to interfere. Admittedly, not after argument because of, inter alia, the prospective amendment of the scheme that was already in place in 2008. So, this would be a very extreme example of a decision to decide that there never was -- that the whole line of authority was misconceived. And of course, at that point, I do say, as a powerful afterthought, that in any event, it is what Section 82(2) means. And accordingly, you shouldn't be making a strange construction with all these detrimental effects. But the sharpest way of indicating to the court the full effect of the submissions is to take you to, as I say, Schedule 11 and it's tab 48 and it's the machinery that starts with paragraph's 15 and 16. And your courts already seen, paragraph 15, which provides that, In this part of the schedule, an original tenancy means any secure tenancy, assured tenancy, introductory tenancy or demoted tenancy in respect of which a possession order was made before the commencement date and which ended before the date, that date, pursuant to the order but not on the execution of the order. Now my point on on paragraph 15 is not that it demonstrates that Parliament then thought that Burrows was correctly decided, but that it would have no content at all except in relation to possibly introductory tenancies or demoted tenancies if this court reverses Burrows before retrospective effect. There will be no tenancies in respect of which a possession order was made before the commencement date and which ended before that date pursuant to the order but not on the execution of the order. So you needn't read [inaudible]."
01:46:04.980,01:46:06.420,spk_3,"So, all you're saying, it makes nonsense of the Schedule."
01:46:07.100,01:46:08.490,spk_5,"Yes."
01:46:08.490,01:46:10.740,spk_3,"But so what? I mean, if actually,"
01:46:12.740,01:46:13.200,spk_1,"if"
01:46:13.200,01:46:38.550,spk_3,"the Schedule and the entire legislation was based on a wrong view of the law, which was the position of the case that My Lady refers to and I mean there are -- surely, the better point may be that why would we think it's appropriate to reverse all this etcetera, etcetera, and invoke the Practice Direction in the light of [inaudible], etcetera, etcetera, but that's a different point entirely. Well, at least I thought it was. It seems to me a different point."
01:46:42.580,01:47:47.720,spk_5,"My submission would be as part and parcel of the same point. We're dealing with a long established line of authority and indeed as My Lady's question, well, example, puts, the problem can arise before you get to the stage of House of Lords authority. You can simply have a problem. Is it correct to decide -- to intervene with a long settled view of the law on which many transactions have been carried out, even if you think the construction of the Court of Appeal is a little bit iffy or not the one you would have adopted had the issue of arisen 30 years before. You can get to that before you get as far as the Lords or the Practice Direction. We have got as far as the Lords. We now have a Parliament's considered response to the practical situation that has arisen. It contains, as I shall demonstrate in a moment, various safeguards for the position of landlords, which might be thought to be necessary because people will have dealt with the situation on the line of long standing authority, all of which is simply rendered meaningless because nothing falls within paragraph 15."
01:47:47.730,01:47:50.230,spk_2,"All of which applies in the case of assured tenancies."
01:47:50.410,01:48:41.060,spk_5,"Yes and the answer to that is that Lord Neuberger was fully alive to that point in Knowsley. I'll take Your Ladyship to it in a moment. He is very, very careful to point out that whilst in the case of secure tenancies, I think there will be literally hundreds of thousands of cases decided on the basis of that Thomas v Elmbridge  is right. The position in assured tenancies that there was no such case out of the court of record until the assured tenancy case itself, with my learned friend's case. He pains to say that. And when we come to what the department has said about the difference between secure tenancies and assured tenancies, they are fully alive to the fact that they needn't have commenced paragraph 15 in full because of Knowsley. Sorry, you say they"
01:48:41.080,01:48:42.530,spk_0,"they are fully alive to that?"
01:48:42.530,01:49:10.880,spk_5,"They were fully aware the moment of drafting the commencement order, that Knowsley had reversed the position as far as assured tenancy of the vast majority of assured tendencies are concerned. They are afraid there may be a few assured tenancies tucked in there which aren't affected by Knowsley and therefore left it all in to deal with that. So, there's a big policy difference between secure tenancies and assured tenancies. The secure tenancy position"
01:49:11.960,01:49:12.220,spk_1,"has"
01:49:12.220,01:49:22.090,spk_5,"been accepted as settled law since at least the House of Lords in Burrows. So settled that Lord --"

01:49:23.270,01:50:02.100,spk_5,"Mr Neuberger as he then was, thought it appropriate, simply, to advance the argument on the basis that it was good law. Parliament has legislated to deal with the position. And whereas with assured tenancies, presumably it might well have been much more acceptable to simply reverse the Court of Appeal decision with full retrospective effect, the Court of Appeal decision in Knowsley, plainly thought it wasn't appropriate to reverse this longstanding line of authority with"
01:50:02.100,01:50:03.100,spk_0,"full retrospective"
01:50:03.100,01:51:44.310,spk_5,"effect, precisely because good lawyers had arranged their -- carried their understanding of the law into effect on the back of apparently correctly decided cases, including Burrows and -- sorry, Brent v Burrows. So, as I say, the importance of paragraph 15 is not that it confirms that Parliament thought that Burrows v Brent were correctly -- sorry Brent v Burrows were correctly decided, but rather, that the machinery it has adopted for dealing with the very messy situation which was present in 2008, would be destroyed if the court was, if this court was simply to reverse this established line of authority. And Your Lordships and My Lady have seen is paragraph 16 and my learned friend appeared to suggest that there might be an option about a tenant choosing to stay with his old tenancy and the right to revive under Section 85 or taking the new tenancy under Schedule 11, but in my submission, that's not right. The terms of paragraph 16 are mandatory. A new tenancy of the dwelling house which was let under the original tenancy is treated as existing on the commencement date between the ex-landlord and the ex-tenant provided that the home condition and the other conditions are met."

01:51:56.240,01:52:00.490,spk_5,"20th. Mr Luba's telling me. It's in both our cases, I think."
01:52:03.890,01:52:04.410,spk_1,"Yes."
01:52:11.670,01:57:20.740,spk_5,"Now, then, if one goes on to the machinery of the remainder of Schedule 11. The sharpest point is to point out that there's a heading, Continuity of tenancy, just above paragraph 21 and what Parliament has done in the Schedule has decided for what purposes the tenancy is to be automatically treated as the same tenancy, a tenancy which continued uninterrupted through the termination period. So it will -- it thinks it's positively acceptable, beneficial, in policy terms, for the tenancy to be continuous for those purposes. 21(2)(a)  benefiting the landlord because it provides for -- it prevents two successions arising as my learned friend correctly states. 21(2)(b) being for the protection of the tenant in relation to the right to buy. And Mr Luba said that 21(2)(b) didn't matter. I'm glad about that because I don't know what it refers to. So, I should keep quiet. [Laughing]. There we have a deliberate decision that some things are to be automatically treated as continuous. And then importantly, in 21(3), In proceedings on a relevant claim, the court concerned may order that the new tenancy and the original tenancy are to be treated for the purposes of claim as a) the same tenancy and b) a tenancy which continued uninterrupted throughout the continuing termination period. The following are relevant claims. And then 4(a), a claim by the ex-tenant or the ex-landlord against the other for the breach of a terminal condition of the original tenancy one, in respect of which proceedings are brought on or after the commencement date or two, in respect of which proceedings were brought but not finally determined before that date. And then a claim by the ex-tenant against the ex-landlord for breach of statutory duty and then any other claim or any description specified by the appropriate national authority by order. And can I just pause with that last one. The court will see at a variety of points in the Schedule that there are provisions which allow the appropriate national authority, the relevant Parliament, to fine-tune the provisions of the Schedule. No doubt to deal with problems that might arise in the future or problems that haven't been fully foreseen at this stage. All of that ability to fine-tune it will be completely undermined by a full retrospective overruling of Brent. Just put to one side. But just to go back to the main thrust of 21, one of the big problems of the tolerated trespasser regime, as demonstrated by Lambeth v Rogers, is how you deal with actions for damages for breach of the covenant for disrepair. The answer, given in Lambeth v Rogers was that there was indeed a discretion to order -- to make a Lazarus order to bring the tenancy back into being. And if that was done, then the tenant would have a good action for damages for breach of the covenant to repair, even in respect of the period before the Lazarus order was made. But, it would be relevant to the exercise of that discretion, whether or not the tenant had complied with the conditions of the order which had originally given rise to the tolerated trespass position or the extent of the default and no doubt a variety of other things. The word, may, in 21(3), is a deliberate policy decision by the legislature dealing with the problem that the consultation had revealed. Do we -- i.e. is it appropriate to legislate with full retrospective effect, or do we in some way regulate the intermediate position? The solution that's adopted is 21(3), a discretion. And can I, I should have made these available before, but can I just hand"

But the general policy of the Act is the same, as I understand it to be both. The reason why the assured tenancies are left in is explained, at least, in this guidance in paragraph 11."
01:58:45.100,01:58:45.240,spk_0,"And"
01:58:45.240,02:02:00.450,spk_5,"Your Lordships will see that that says, The provision in Schedule 11 were drafted to apply to all types of assured and secured tenancies. Most RSL tenancies of assured period of tenancy at the time of 2008, that was going through Parliament, the effective existing case law was the tolerated trespasser doctrine applied to such tenancies. This was the result of the Court of Appeal judgment in the case of Knowsley v White, which involved an assured periodic tenancy. The decision was reversed by the House of Lords who handed down judgement in early December 2008. The effect of the House of Lords decision is that assured periodic tenants will not have become tolerated trespassers. Over the term of assured tenants in the 1980s that includes very other types of tenancies in assured periodic tendencies. And I confess, I don't understand the detail of the rest of that. But the underlying concern is there might be a residual class which makes it sensible to leave in place the provisions are Schedule 11 dealing with the short tenancies. And then, My Lord and My Lady at paragraph 58, My Lordship and My Lady will see there's a heading, Treated the original new tenancy as continuous for certain purposes, and says, Part 2 restores tenancy status by creating a new tenancy which comes into effect on commencement. An alternative approach would have been to revive the original tenancy i.e. to treat it as though it had never ended. Indeed, this is the approach on which the government originally consulted. However, it was recognised if tenancy rights to be restored retrospectively in this way, sufficient safeguards would need to be put in place to ensure that landlords are protected from claims arising out of decisions made in good faith on the basis that occupiers were tolerated trespassers. Such an approach is likely to be both cumbersome and risky. Instead, it was decided to create a new tenancy, but to provide that for certain relevant purposes, the original tenancy and the new tenancy are treated as the same and continuous and so on. And then your -- then over the page, finally, I'm trespassing on on the court's time, I draw the court's attention to under the heading, Relevant claims, which is the one is the claim where the repairing covenant example comes into play. Paragraph 64 describes the nature of the discretion and indeed says, Courts have already been making decisions of this nature in dealing with claims concerning tolerated trespassers. And I rely on that paragraph after the event statement that the intention of the Schedule 11 is to enact in statutory form, the Lambeth v Rogers discretion. My Lord, I'm sorry I've taken quite longer."

And in the context of this case, it's importance is really this, that as I said yesterday, Your Lordships and My Lady are being invited to depart from the earlier decision of the House of Lords in Burrows, confronted with an invitation to exercise the discretion recognised by the practice direction. A court necessarily has to consider whether it's appropriate to do so itself because the effects of retrospective change are not so great as to be unacceptable, or whether it should leave it to Parliament to make the change with a number of provisions designed to protect or modify the effect of fully retrospective change. This is really an extreme example of that case we have on the statute book, a highly and carefully developed framework in Schedule 11 for dealing with the changes. All of which, as I said yesterday, we rendered nugatory, if the court was simply to do what Parliament has deliberately decided not to do and make a fully retrospective change."
00:02:40.030,00:03:50.500,spk_2,"You took us to Part 2 of the Schedule and we did see, of course, how I think it's Paragraph 21 is carefully constructed, but I have to confess I haven't been able to work out in my mind what the effect would be on parties if we were to make the change, the only parties involved, as I understand it. But correct me if I'm wrong, are the social landlords on the one hand and those who are tolerated trespassers on the other. Yes. I mean, I don't think there any third parties involved here and is it the kind of circumstance where we would need to consider a situation which I think is referred to of, a tenancy having been granted, to tolerated trespassers, to put them into some kind of regular situation. So one would have the match between us saying, in fact, they were, they had the benefit of the law as it has been established for assured tenancies.

I'll tell you that in a moment that's the purpose of the next bit of my submission is to make good the proposition that it was a deliberate decision by Parliament not to reverse Burrows in the sense of a simple retrospective legislation restoring everybody to the status of secure tenants but instead to produce a mechanism which protected landlords. When you succeed to [inaudible]"
00:08:06.370,00:08:10.680,spk_0,"you succeed to all the liabilities of the previous tenant? Yes. [crosstalk]"
00:08:12.890,00:11:11.220,spk_3,"If you succeed, the tendency according to the Section 87 I think it is, or 89, Section 89 vests in the success of the same tenancy, vests in the success. That's the mechanism. So My Lord, can I go back to that guidance and then on to Knowsley and [inaudible] make good in a hopefully coherent way these submissions. We saw yesterday Paragraph 11 of the Guidance and I'll go to that because it makes good my timing point. The second sentence says most RSL tenants have, in assured periodic tenancy, at the time that the 2008 Act was going through Parliament the effect of existing case law that the Tolerated Trespassing doctrine applied to such tendencies. This was the result of the Court of Appeal judgment in Knowsley May 2007, which involved an assured periodic tenancy reversed by the House of Lords who handed down judgment in early December 2008. The effects of the House of Lords' decision is that assured periodic tendencies will not have become tolerated trespasses, and then it goes on to explain that there may be other categories of tenants and RSL landlords who are assured tenancies other than assured periodic tendencies. And the last paragraph says while we record the decision to commence in its entirety, whilst recognising that this may render part of the provisions [inaudible] level redundant, we consider just more prudent to do this than to risk leaving any potential tolerated trespasses unprotected in the same way all types of original tenancy being catered for in the successor Landlord Orders. I do say yesterday that at commencement Parliament, at commencement Parliament was aware, or the Secretary of State was aware that he was making a commencement order which will be indeed nugatory in relation to a large class of assured tenancies, but wasn't quite sure that it was all assured tenancies. That's the approach, of course, effectively at this moment in time, the Secretary of State has been effectively invited by the House of Lords, I can put it this way, in Knowsley to make that distinction. Because the House of Lords had drawn back in Knowsley from saying Burrows is wrongly decided. It's true they had drawn back but no one invited him."
00:11:11.220,00:11:14.890,spk_1,"Nobody asked, in fact, if anything, positive discouragement."
00:11:15.180,00:11:28.020,spk_3,"I rely on that. It's not a cheap point. It is that there was a genuine recognition and some debate amongst counsel before Knowsley was argued."

00:12:05.630,00:12:36.540,spk_3,"authorities? It certainly was no argument advanced to their Lordships to the effect that it was appropriate to examine the authorities. The opposite has just been pointed out to me. But it is crystal clear from the speech of Lord Neuberger that he himself thought it right to consider for himself whether he should suggest the reversal of Burrows."
00:12:37.770,00:13:45.190,spk_6,"He did it in a reasonably guarded way did he not? He said that he suspected that, if, turned their minds to, and that's a very crude paraphrase, that they might have reached the same view in relation to a secure tenancy. But the impression that I got and it may be that this is wrong is that it didn't, the argument didn't get past first base? There are various stages. First of all, the cause of the agreement of counsel. The court decides not even to go into that territory. Second stage, maybe it looks at the, goes into the territory but decides, well, no, because of the well-established rule, we were not going to review it, and we'll give a bleak comment that we might have taken a different view had it been open to us. I wonder whether it got to that second stage with Lord Neuberger or whether he and his colleagues refrained even from going into the second stage."
00:13:45.420,00:14:57.670,spk_3,"My submission is that he plainly went to the second stage. Admittedly, I was going to go to it in a moment and I will do. I'm sorry. No, it's important. He admittedly went to the second stage only of his own volition. He wasn't invited to go there by Mr Luba as part of his argument on assured tendencies and possibly more relevantly by me. Because, of course, I was arguing to defend the position of two secure tendencies in relation to other issues from tolerated trespassers judgement that we, I formed, I make no bones about it was that I would win anyway. Turned out to be correct. And so in the position where Parliament was addressing it and where one would have had to have the argument I'm now having against myself about whether it was right to reverse Burrows in the face of Schedule 11, that choice was made. But then Lord Neuberger, who is plainly sceptical about Burrows one senses was sceptical about Burrows at the time of those looked at it for himself and decided not"

00:15:59.540,00:16:01.530,spk_2,"can do that"
00:16:01.540,00:17:20.199,spk_3,"and I'm going to show the court in a moment. Representations were made once the government had made claim that his position was simply reversed Burrows. Those local authorities in particular, made a series of submissions. Don't do that because we've been conducting our affairs in perfectly good faith for years. On the basis that Burrows is good law. And we don't want to be met with a whole series of actions which are premised on the basis that transactions are always out of a mistake of law. And look for, the history goes, consultation on full retrospective reversal representations that's not a good idea. Government thinks about whether they can simply safeguard the position of landlords in relation to some of the transactions, but instead, this is what comes out of later passage of the guidance, opts for a situation which is Schedule 11, which is that generally speaking. It's not retrospective, but it is retrospective for certain purposes, succession being one of them and can be made retrospective by the exercise of the discretion of the court in an individual case in relation to, say, preparing governance. That's the machinery."

00:17:31.040,00:17:31.770,spk_1,"you. Because"
00:17:31.830,00:17:51.390,spk_3,"it doesn't deal with. I accept it doesn't deal with this case i.e. The situation where there isn't a succession because of the full, the absence of a full retrospective reversal of Burrows that isn't discussed as far as I can see."
00:17:52.260,00:18:23.310,spk_1,"And that is interesting, is it not? Because one of the points you've just made is that a very large number of people would have succeeded if the tendency was still in existence. Because we're talking about thousands and thousands of tolerated trespassers and no doubt many of them will have died in the intervening period. So you're saying that that's a large group of people who potentially were affected, and yet it doesn't seem to have been thought about in the"
00:18:23.320,00:18:51.020,spk_3,"Well, I put it the other way around because of the range of problems. That full retrospective it will give rise to a solution which was adopted and deliberately adopted, which dealt with the position of people who in the future will be able to take advantage of the right to succeed but didn't reverse the position for those who, where the death had already taken place."
00:18:51.030,00:19:16.200,spk_1,"I understand that. But I'm really getting at whether there's any discussion of that because all the emphasis in the discussion, frankly, is on repairing covenants. And one completely understands why. Because that's a nightmare scenario for especially London local authorities over the past few decades. But so anyway, you're going to take us there."
00:19:16.210,00:19:30.610,spk_3,"I'll go there and comment a moment on that. So that's the timing point in Paragraphs 11 and 12 of this Guidance. I took the court yesterday,"

However, it was recognised that if tenancy rights were to be restored retrospectively in this way, sufficient safeguards would need to be put in place to ensure that landlords were protected from claims arising out of decisions made in good faith on the basis of the occupiers were tolerated trespassers is such an approach was likely to be both cumbersome and risky."

But I would, I caution against putting any trust in my own ability to identify them all if they, we will see in some of the consultation responses that this point, this made in 58 is recorded as having been recognised by almost all the respondents. I don't mean local authorities, all the people who responded to the consultation that you would need to have in place safeguards to deal with the possibility of claims arising out of the fact that transactions had taken place under a mistaken basis in law."

00:21:33.060,00:21:45.740,spk_2,"I'm not quite sure I fully grasped that one, even what the differences between the situation as it is, as it were, and what would happen if Burrows was reversed. In the"
00:21:46.630,00:22:40.930,spk_3,"facts of this case, maybe an example on the law as it stood if, or stands, if Burrows is rightly decided. The court confronted with an application to revive the tenancy, the Lazarus Order, by postponing the date of possession until after the date of the court order. Therefore, tenancy comes back into being. The court has a discretion with whether or not to make that order. And I'm going to take your lordships in a moment to a case of Lambert and Rogers, where the Court of Appeal discusses the basis on which that discretion is to be exercised. And it played that it would probably not be exercised in favour of the tolerated trespasser if, at the moment of the application for the order, there were, say, very substantial amounts of rent arrears."
00:22:45.440,00:23:00.990,spk_1,"But if the order is granted and so Lazarus arises, then the repairing covenants also arise retrospectively and therefore the landlord is in breach."
00:23:01.080,00:23:09.110,spk_3,"If the premises are in a state of disrepair, there may be a very substantial damages, well small or very substantial damages claim. Would the court be"
00:23:09.120,00:23:23.180,spk_0,"entitled in its discretion to say, okay, that repairing covenant, so to speak, is operative, but you can't claim for all these years, months, or whatever it is that you were in arrears and a tolerated trespasser."
00:23:23.930,00:23:26.900,spk_3,"Your Lordship said the answer to that question was, yes. I"
00:23:26.900,00:23:27.610,spk_0,"think I did, didn't I? I thought I said that, yes."
00:23:27.620,00:24:14.880,spk_3,"I don't think I, there was some debate about that in Knowsley as Your Lordship may or may not recall, but it's not necessary, for my purposes to give an answer to that. What matters is that confronted with a situation where there was a discretion to deal with, the tolerated trespassers in the repairing government, Parliament chose deliberately not to simply sidestep that discretion by a full retrospective amendment by a former effective restoration of the tenancy, but chose instead to replicate the Lambert and Rogers solution."
00:24:14.930,00:24:50.580,spk_2,"If one contemplates the repairing covenant point while the person, in possession as it were, if the property is simply a tolerated trespasser, then there isn't a covenant, and I can imagine that as far as authorities pressed with the resources and all the rest of it would say, well, we'll concentrate on the cases where there is a covenant and we'll direct our resources because we actually have to do it under contract. But we won't do it for the time being, at least in cases of tolerated trespassers and therefore, as it were, the need for a pair of grows because things are left in the state of disrepair for longer. Is that the kind of thing that one should have in mind?"
00:24:50.680,00:25:04.050,spk_3,"That's certainly a possibility. Like Mr. Luba, I suspect that, in fact, is very many local authorities don't actually distinguish between tolerated trespassers and others."
00:25:04.050,00:25:11.020,spk_4,"And we saw yesterday that there is liability for Nuisance. Even in the case of tolerated trespasser."
00:25:11.270,00:25:19.240,spk_2,"They have an interest in keeping up the standards of their housing stock because they may actually find they're using the property for somebody else next year or something like that."
00:25:19.650,00:25:32.660,spk_1,"And a large quantity of these dwellings in this part of the world at least are flats or maisonettes where you've got to keep up the building. You've got to keep up the common parts in any event."
00:25:32.670,00:26:20.910,spk_3,"All of this is correct. It's also correct that there are very large numbers of properties that are simply in disrepair anyway. My submission doesn't need to go any further than that Parliament recognised there was a policy decision to be made as to whether or not to simply retrospectively revive the tenancy with all the incidents that follow from that, the investigation in full. It's not just repairing covenants and all the covenants of the tenancy and all the other attributes that go with the status of a tenant or to devise a machinery such as Paragraph 21. I think my case comes down to the fact that in a situation where the practice direction is in play,"
00:26:21.470,00:26:21.720,spk_5,"which"
00:26:21.720,00:27:13.150,spk_3,"is you're being invited to depart from a previous decision of the House of Lords, which is the reality of this case, it is inappropriate and actually positively contrary to the orderly development of the law to render nugatory a very carefully considered settlement of a problem which obviously exists. Even if there wasn't 2008 Statues, Your Lordships and My Lady would have to think about whether it was right to upset an existing line of authority with retrospective effect. If I was representing Southwark I would plainly be saying no, it wasn't anyway, quite independently of the 2008 Act. But once you've got the 2008 Act then in my submission, it's simply not acceptable for the court to circumvent the machinery."
00:27:14.880,00:27:16.890,spk_2,"Well, thank you so much. Is there anything more in the guidance?"
00:27:17.540,00:29:31.650,spk_3,"At 58 and 59 Your Lordship, My Lady will see, 58 has said. I'm sorry 59 said it was decided to create a new tenancy provided for certain relevant purposes. The original tenants in the new tendency is to be treated as the same and continuous. In this way, the provisions ensure that as far as possible neither landlord and tenant disadvantaged by the tolerated trespasser period and then the relevant purposes are A) to ensure the tenant has already become a successor under the original tenancy does not acquire additional succession rights can only be one accession, succession by law, and then there are various other purposes which are set out to go to. And then your Lordship and my Lady will see over the page that the heading relevant claims. The guidance describes Paragraph 21.3, and Paragraph 64 says when considering such a claim will be for the court to decide whether to take into account the tolerated trespasser period or not, courts are already making, been making decisions of this nature when dealing with claims concerning tolerated trespassers. While the tolerated trespasser has no right to claim compensation for breach of a repair obligation. For example, it's within the court, power of the courts to vary the possession order to restore the trespassers, tenancy and so to enable the claim to succeed. In this way the provision in Paragraph 21 mirror the position in relation to tolerated trespass is, however, where the courts use the power in Paragraph 21.3. It is only for the purposes of the claim. It does not restore the tendency status for other purposes.

The existence of tolerated trespassers created the problem with loss of tenancy status, usually without tenants' knowledge, problems arising from the loss of Tenancy status include, and then the first of them is listed as, in fact succession rights and then right to exchange, contractual right to repair, and maintenance of property to secure tenants and lawful increases in rent voting rights.

Only around 45% of responses address this issue. A small number of responses expressed the view that it was unreasonable that tolerated trespassers have all the benefits of security of tenure. For example, it is proposed that consideration was given to denying or suspending any right to buy applications.

Those who oppose legislation did so for a number of reasons. Some respondents took the view that it was not the legislation which was defective, but the court form. Others were concerned about legislation retrospectively and felt it would pose too great a risk to landlords in terms of liability claims from current and past tolerated trespassers. One respondent suggested an alternative would be somehow to reinstate attendance rights without reinstating the tenancy itself retrospectively. Because that's pretty well what happened."

If so, in what circumstances and how they might this be achieved? Responses. Who answered this question? About 70% were virtually unanimous about the legislation to protect landlords from any liability arising out of claims arising from the restoration of tenancies to tolerated trespassers. Some question how a few of the fact that any landlord action would have been taken in compliance with the law at the time, and he claims the liability against them will be successful. However, the prospect of historic possession decisions being revisited very significant some concern among some respondents who questioned whether it be possible to legislate in such a way that it would be entirely claimed proof and so that in a way that's one of the issues where that might arise as a successor, a person who would otherwise have been a successor who is left. One can see that any claim by such a successor would be difficult. One might well feel it would be lost because he would now be able to maintain it here now, satisfied the tenant condition. History teaches that maybe unwise to deal with that, but the most important point is dealing with liability for damages. The respondents who answered this question and 70% of those respondents did answer this question that 70% were virtually unanimous about the need to protect landlords from any liability arising out of claims resulting from the restoration of tenancies to tolerated trespassers. Now it's clear from what we have already seen in the guidance that that response caused the re-think to introduce the mechanism of Paragraph 21.3."

And then one sees that when confronted with the alternatives, the government indeed consulted, first of all, on the basis that that's precisely what it would do by legislation but then opted for an alternative because of what it apprehended or was persuaded to apprehend would have been the difficulty in protecting landlords. The question is, what is the position of the court in all of this? Let us say, as I say, the premise is for the sake of argument, we consider that the Thompson interpretation was wrong."

Then, then the court may feel obliged to reverse it whatever the practical consequences, but we're not in that situation. I'm going to be making some suspicions that actually the only possible reading of 82.2 is the reading that led to Thompson and Elmbridge. I note that Mr. Luba hasn't actually put forward another construction of the words. It's quite important to realise that, one has to grapple with the wording in some way. But once in a situation where there's a decision which has been accepted as correct on the wording, albeit with unfortunate practical consequences. Then the court has to decide whether or not to use the freedom granted by the practice direction to depart from the decision or not. And my submission is no more than these practicalities are very obviously highly relevant to that decision."

She kept to the agreement and was treated in compliance with the order.

Did not leave any relevant factor out of account. And then my Lord, Lord Justice Simon Brown said, the critical question facing the Judge. The second paragraph question, which is simply not arisen in the earlier cases whether or not to allow Ms. Rogers to claim damages in respect of the disrepair of the premises between December 1992 and April 1997 i.e. during the limbo period, housing provides mechanisms where either result could have been achieved by making unconditionally. You did order. He did under Section 85(2)(b) the Judge revived previously determined, secured tenancy with retrospective effect. He could, however, have made the order by virtue of Section 85 subject to conditions see Section 85(3)(b) that Ms. Rogers' damages claim or part of it should not be pursued or he could incidentally make an order under Section 85(2)(a) which would have left Ms. Rogers a tolerated trespasser.

As Your Lordships will see that in the middle of Paragraph 73 he says, there will undoubtedly have been tens of thousands of cases in the County Court. Indeed, many negotiations much legal advice in many actions involving secure tenants, which also proceeded on this assumption i.e. the assumption that Thompson and Burrows are correct and then first sentence of Paragraph 74. Until 2007, however, there's been no case, at least in a court of record, which involved, considering the question whether the reasoning or conclusion in Thompson has improved in Burrows applied to assured tenancies. So when the Court of Appeal in Knowsley, the Appeal in Knowsley came before the Court of Appeal, it was an open question with an assured tenancy ended as soon as the tenancy to comply with the suspended order. So that's the contrast between tens of thousands of cases proceeded on the basis that poses correctly decided and this decision being made for the first time in Knowsley itself in the Court of Appeal. Well, then, Paragraph 91 through"
00:58:15.270,00:58:16.010,spk_2,"to 93"
00:58:16.010,00:59:07.620,spk_3,"he explains his approach to Burrows, 91 which I'll come back to in a moment in my final submissions on issue one is the only place where, in this hearing, any attempt is made to actually construe what Section 82(2) says. And it will be my submission with respect in a moment that the construction doesn't work. What he says is, however, it should be added that I strongly suspect that if the point has not been determined in Burrows, I would have reached the same conclusion in relation to Section 85 of the 85 Act as that which I've reached in relation to Section 9"
00:59:07.620,00:59:08.630,spk_5,"of the 1988"
00:59:08.630,01:00:46.840,spk_3,"Act. There's a powerful case for saying that quote the data on which the tenant is to give up possession in pursuance of the order in Section 82(2) of the 1985 Act can and therefore should mean the date specified in the warrant of possession, which is duly executed or acted on by the tenant. And then he makes another Section 121 point. It was arguably inconsistent with the language of 121. And then we've seen the passages in 92 and 93, but records Mr. Luba with my support and Mr. Harden support Mr. Underwood's support, saying simply too late to take that course and repeating the view that Thompson had been assumed to be right has been acted on in many tens of thousands of cases over the past 20 years or more, particularly since it had the express approval of Your Lordships house more than 12 years ago. And then he refers to the Parliamentary material in particular Schedule 11 and in my Paragraph 93. In my view, we should not reconsider the view expressed in this house in Burrows that Thompson was vitally decided so far as secure tenancies are concerned. And the reasons are in the absence of any submission to that effect from the bar in the face of discouragement from Counsel highly experienced in the field. It would be wrong for this House to effectively go back on its previous approval of a longstanding decision which had been acted on a plethora of cases where there is in place amending legislation having the same effect as such a reversal in which Parliament has decided to amend the law only prospectively."
01:00:46.850,01:01:03.860,spk_2,"It's an interesting passage because he's tempted to nibble at the point, isn't it? And then he draws back from it. Yes, but having explained why he doesn't want to pursue the point any further, it's not surprising he doesn't actually go further back, further on to examine the point than he does in Paragraph 91."
01:01:03.870,01:02:02.790,spk_3,"Completely with that. But, Your Lordship, he does earlier in the judgment it's an important part of his conclusion on assured tenancies recognise many of the practical problems that the doctrine recognised by Burrows has given rise to. Your Lordship will understand. I'm not submitting that there haven't been practical problems. That's not my case is to suggest that those practical problems don't exist, my case is first of all this point about not departing from Burrows. But the second point is the point I'm just going to come to which is that the drafting, the construction suggestion in such in Paragraph 91 doesn't actually work and if I ask your Lordships to have Section 82(2) available"

The court makes an order, the tenant leaves, say, a month after the date specified in the order voluntarily, without there ever being a warrant. When in those circumstances, I ask rhetorically, does the tenancy come to an end? The natural and absolutely straightforward reading of 82(2) is that the tenancy ends on the date on which the tenant is required to give up possession in pursuance of the order, it is to give up possession is the language of inviting the person making the decision to make a judgement at the time of the order. When is the tenant required to give up possession in pursuance of the order? Or is to give up certain again required into that. So"

When it actually was given up, which, that is, it's the choice probably is between the data on which the tenant is required to give up possession in pursuance of the order, which I say is natural meaning or Lord Neuberger's construction, which I think has to be gives up possession.

01:04:54.360,01:06:16.160,spk_3,"without straining too much, if a warrant is issued, that will specify a date on which the bailiffs are going to arrive and execute the warrant. So without doing much damage to the language of 82(2), you can see that in that situation. The date on which the defendant is to give up possession is the date specified in the warrant rather than the date specified in the order. That's a small step. Well, in fact, a lot of course, the warrant is still in pursuance of the order. But in my example, you never have a date, except the date in the order, except unless you construe 82(2) as meaning, as Lord [inaudible] says the date on which he comes to give up possession, gives up possession. And my very simple point is not what it says. I don't need to go as far as saying that that construction is so clearly right that for that reason alone, you shouldn't depart from Burrows.

01:07:38.440,01:07:51.600,spk_3,"you're in the opening words of 82(2) that is the landlord has obtained an order for possession. It's 82(2) that tells you when the Tenancy comes to an end. Yes,"
01:07:51.600,01:08:10.310,spk_1,"but it has to be read, perhaps in the context of 82(1), which is the prohibition on the landlord bringing the tenancy to an end. Yeah, that's the contrary argument, Mr. Drabble because otherwise all you have is not the tenancy ending, but the security ending."

01:08:50.930,01:09:17.839,spk_3,"think my point is that his explanation is a reading of the wording, which doesn't work. In my example, Baroness Hale is right. Then it's incomplete.

01:09:46.980,01:10:09.890,spk_3,"Exactly, I think that's the best way of seeing my case is that one gets into the territory of the factors that I've outlined because one can't simply dismiss Burrows and Thompson and Elmbridge is a judicial aberration as it were, they they are giving effect to the natural meaning of the words."
01:10:10.450,01:10:22.520,spk_0,"I mean, I think the recent jurisprudence make plain that the more obviously wrong the court thinks the earlier construction was the easier it'll be depart from it, which is not a wholly surprising proposition"
01:10:24.330,01:11:36.990,spk_3,"Indeed. Just to complete that picture which I won't invite Your Lordships and My Lady to go back to it. But it's important to bear in mind that Lord Jauncey certainly and carefully, in careful reasoning in Burrows itself adopted my approach, I'm now advancing to 82(2), and I think it's fair to say that despite the explanation for 85(3)'s reference to mean profits as an example of torrential drafting, have I got the phrase right, yeah, which maybe, well be correct. One cannot say the construction of a statutory scheme, which includes 82(2), has its natural meaning that I refer to it in a scheme which also includes 85(c). I contemplates a situation where there will be tenants ex-tenants in possession in the premises. Still, paying mean profits is obviously wrong or should just likely be put aside."

01:12:21.590,01:12:22.150,spk_0,"Yeah,"
01:12:36.390,01:13:02.140,spk_3,"I think this point it comes down to this that Lord Neuberger was able to deal with the reference to mean profits and the assured tenancy regime, partly because simply wasn't an express provision like 82(2) to deal with once you've got 82(2) in play. And then there is a situation in which somebody will be paying mean profits if my construction of 82(2) is correct."
01:13:02.720,01:13:04.320,spk_2,"Perfectly logically, as he says."

Not endeavouring to do that. I do say the problem has been addressed by Schedule 11 and Burrows isn't so plainly on the court should just put it to one side. I think these are my submissions issue one. Overnight I looked at the case that Baroness Hale mentioned Bakewell. We have copies of that available if it helps."

Of course, one is dealing with the first time an issue reaches the Lords and that the drafting of Section 98 I think it is that produced the new regime doesn't have the sort of elaborate safeguard features that Schedule 11 as in our case say. And I think I can say this one looks at the argument in Bakewell. The issue of what to do about Section 90, sorry Section 68. I don't know why I'm calling it 90.

01:18:45.920,01:18:58.790,spk_3,"it is the whole scheme. The right to apply under Section 85(2) is a right that is capable of transmission on by either will or on intestacy."

01:19:04.440,01:22:31.530,spk_3,"Our submission is that if we're right about Burrows, the court is approaching it on the basis that the true construction of the '85 Act is that the tenancy ends at the moment identified by 82(2) that is the date specified in the order. It is clear that the scheme does not contemplate anything surviving that can be transmitted to the estate or indeed, to anybody else. I can ask the court to go to Paragraph 24 of our printed case. We make the point that the apparent attractiveness of an offender argument depends upon the assumption that the right under, to make the application under 85(2). Sorry you're dropping your words. Sorry, we make the point that the right, that the apparent attractiveness of my learned friend's case rests on the assumption that the, if he's right about the nature of the right under 85(2) it will vest on death in somebody who is likely to make the application on behalf of the successor. But we see no basis for that assumption at all. It's the right, if it is capable of transmission, will vest in accordance with the will or in accordance with the rules on intestacy. There is absolutely no reason to assume that there is likely to be an identity of interest between the person who takes on Intestacy are under the will, and the successor is quite likely to be because they're going to be part of the same family often, but it's by no means obvious that that is the case we can imagine a relatively simple Will, leaving all my estate to my mother. Tenant has been living with his brother for a long period of time. Mother may feel well, I wish to make an application on behalf of the estate to [inaudible] the tenancy may not feel that, and the problem is that, the problem is that there is no reason to make the assumption that absolutely implicit in my learned friend's case and the facts as they presently stand the estate is no doubt vested in the public trustee because I understand it. Mr. Allen Austin died intestate, and there's been no Personal Representative appointed. So the person or my learned friend's argument with the right to make the application is the public Trustee. Now very difficult to see what policy basis on what the trustee, the public trustee, should decide whether or not to make the application."
01:22:31.700,01:23:10.480,spk_4,"Well, the public Trustee is not a Personal Representative of the public Trustee is simply the recipient, which would otherwise not have a home as I mentioned yesterday in this sort of situation where we're dealing with people who are not well-off, they can't pay their rent. They're not the sort of people who go to solicitors and make wills and appoint executors and the natural course, which is very natural. Not at all surprising. The surviving brother, who is the one who was living there, applies to the County Court to be appointed to represent the estate. That's entirely natural, not unusual."
01:23:10.610,01:24:49.890,spk_3,"I'm not suggesting the opposite for a moment. I can completely understand that that can happen and no doubt commonly, very commonly, does happen. But equally that's the course of the family structure of the family concerned. The position could well be that someone else is the obvious Personal Representative, or that if there's a will, the estate has gone in a very different direction. All of this is just an introduction to try to suggest that it would be rather surprising to find that the statutory scheme did envisage that the right to make the application under 85(2) devolved on Intestacy or or according to the terms of a Will, when it's crystal clear that the rest of the scheme is designed to ensure that the rights that are protected are this personal rights of the secure tenant gained by the fact that he satisfies the tenancy, the tenants condition. The rest of the statutory scheme is crystal clear that the the rights that are protected under the tenant are the rights, the personal rights of the tenant derived from his status as a secure tenant, satisfying the tenancy, a tenancy condition there being no possibility of that right being capable of transmission, as I'll show Your Lordships in the moment. But it's an axiom of my learned friend's own case that the security of status as a secure tenant cannot be transmitted except in accordance with the terms of the statute itself."

01:24:59.590,01:25:10.060,spk_1,"the creation of a secure tenancy comes through the coincidence of the landlord condition of the tenant condition, and the tenant condition is a very individual personal thing. Yes,"

01:25:24.080,01:25:31.850,spk_3,"simply, its simplest in a fixed term tenancy. Those property rights are plainly as property"

01:25:32.860,01:25:54.330,spk_3,"of transmission by will or Intestacy, and the statute envisages that that is the case, we'll come to it in a moment. The status of protection as a secure tenant is a personal status, which arises from the fact that the individual fulfils the tenancy condition. But"
01:25:54.340,01:25:59.060,spk_4,"equally the status of a successor for the purposes of the"
01:25:59.060,01:25:59.700,spk_2,"Act"
01:26:00.000,01:26:20.160,spk_4,"doesn't as you yourself have been emphasising in any way depend on rights under a Will or Intestacy, it depends on satisfying the statutory conditions. And one of the statutory purposes is to provide protection for a successor as well as for that the secure tenant while he's alive."
01:26:20.170,01:26:49.240,spk_3,"That is entirely true, but my learned friend has to face the problem that if Burrows is correctly decided, the statutory scheme envisages deliberately that the, there is nothing to vest in the successor. There is no secure tenancy at the moment of death. That's why he has to argue that the right, which appears to be associated with the security provisions, is"
01:26:49.240,01:26:50.090,spk_2,"capable of being"
01:26:50.100,01:27:00.970,spk_3,"transmitted by by will, as opposed to simply not existing at the moment that there is no secure tenant, our relatively simple construction."
01:27:01.190,01:27:17.460,spk_2,"What about Section 90? This is the term certain, we looked at that briefly yesterday. You've got a situation where the tenant dies, there's a tenant of course who dies and the tenancy is for a term certain."
01:27:20.040,01:27:20.670,spk_3,"[background noise]"
01:27:22.810,01:27:23.190,spk_1,"[background noise]"

01:27:27.250,01:27:27.620,spk_2,"Yeah,"
01:27:27.620,01:28:10.640,spk_3,"I was going to come to that. Section 90 and Section 91 in my submission, entirely consistent with my case because what they make it plain is that what cannot devolve except in accordance with the with the provisions of the statute itself, is the status of security. That's what Section 91 says."
01:28:11.210,01:28:11.560,spk_2,"Sorry."
01:28:11.560,01:29:10.890,spk_3,"Section 90, Subsection 1 applies when a secure tenancy, tenant dies and the tenancy is for a term certain, it remains a secure tenancy until its vested or otherwise disposed of in the course of the administration of the tenant's estate mentioned in Subsection 3 and then it ceases to be a secure tenancy on being vested or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the administration of the of the estate, unless vested in the, either in accordance with the Matrimonial Causes Act or in a person qualified to succeed to the tenant. So that's drafted on the assumption that there is a property right, the term certain, that is capable of being devolved by will if, in accordance with the will it ultimately vests in someone who is qualified to be a successor then the statute says that the tenancy continues to be a secure tenancy throughout that process."
01:29:13.200,01:29:26.340,spk_0,"I'm sorry, I don't under Section 90 Subsection 1. I mean, if a tolerated trespasser, albeit that he's got a tenancy for a term certain, dies. I mean, I understand you're saying they're not a secured tenant."
01:29:27.370,01:29:38.940,spk_3,"If you're dealing with a tolerated trespasser. Sorry. If you're dealing with a term certain then we won't be dealing with a tolerated trespasser, they're going to be there under the terms certain. So 90 won't actually be in play. Sorry,"
01:29:39.390,01:29:42.310,spk_0,"you can't have a tolerated trespasser under a term certain?"
01:29:42.960,01:29:44.740,spk_3,"Well, not if a term certain hasn't been terminated."
01:29:44.750,01:29:52.230,spk_4,"The term certain that is going to be subject to the ordinary Clause for general reentry, isn't it? That's got to be"
01:29:53.190,01:29:53.660,spk_3,"assumed"
01:29:53.660,01:29:54.970,spk_4,"that that was part of Parliament's intention."
01:29:56.860,01:30:14.870,spk_3,"Yes. Well, if that's the case, then if that's an example that's being put. The term certain has already been forfeit. Then we have the same problem that we're dealing with in the present case, which is the Section 90 doesn't apply because there is no secure tenant at the moment of death."
01:30:15.510,01:30:19.080,spk_2,"So the opening words of Subsection 2 couldn't apply then?"
01:30:19.710,01:30:29.170,spk_3,"And then the opening words of Section, Subsection 2 couldn't operate because you're not in. You're not within Section 90 at all because you're not a secure tenant. Not a very"
01:30:29.170,01:30:32.200,spk_0,"helpful intervention. Your answer may or may not be helpful [laughing]"
01:30:33.920,01:30:37.510,spk_3,"I think"
01:30:37.510,01:31:14.660,spk_2,"Mr. Luba was making a rather more general point. I think, really, that this is a scheme which does envisage transmission data, certain individuals, people who one can see identified in Subsection 3 of Section 90 for example, and then looks rather strange that one should cut it off in the situation we're contemplating in Section 85. He says why it doesn't mention death. It doesn't actually do that at all, doesn't say anything terminates, particularly death. And the thing should be given a sort of purposive construction, as it were to fit in with the way the other sections work."
01:31:15.090,01:31:51.340,spk_3,"Well, the answer to that is that, though that all his other examples are examples of a situation where the statute does does deliberately produce the results that he wishes in the transmission on death, where there is a secure tenants is expressly dealt with by Section 90 and Section 91. Also 91 is dealing with assignment that is dealt with by 91. Neither of those are actually in play. If there is no secure tenant because the tenant is"
01:31:51.800,01:31:52.510,spk_5,"dead,"
01:31:55.470,01:31:55.720,spk_6,"what"

01:32:02.730,01:32:19.900,spk_3,"The other example that he gives is the example in 85(5), that an individual other than the tenant commit the application under 85(3)"
01:32:20.080,01:32:21.510,spk_2,"I missed the references."

01:32:25.840,01:32:26.320,spk_2,"Yes,"
01:32:28.180,01:32:34.510,spk_3,"he is, I think, saying that a statutory scheme envisages that someone other than the tenant can make the application under 85(2). Presumably, after"
01:32:35.690,01:32:36.810,spk_0,"the death of the tenant"
01:32:37.800,01:32:38.150,spk_1,"or"
01:32:38.150,01:32:38.670,spk_0,"not?"
01:32:39.420,01:32:40.640,spk_1,"No, this, Section 85(5) certainly isn't"
01:32:41.430,01:32:44.190,spk_3,"especially dealing with that. No"
01:32:44.200,01:32:46.680,spk_1,"it's not dealing with that really at all. It's"
01:32:46.680,01:32:51.750,spk_4,"typically the case where the husband was simply left home and the wife is left there. I appreciate that"
01:32:52.440,01:32:59.630,spk_0,"but say the husband left home and dies. Is the wife then in a position to or not?"
01:33:02.730,01:33:25.120,spk_3,"If she is, it is because 85(5) expressly says so. It doesn't deal with that because it doesn't actually say death, but she is, by statute, put in the same position as the secure tenant to make the original secure tenant to make the application to postpone the data possession. That's what, 85(5) says."
01:33:25.560,01:33:30.710,spk_2,"That means you can read Subsection 2 in that way to allow her to do it under Subsection 5."
01:33:30.840,01:33:42.120,spk_3,"Yes, that may be right, but that doesn't assist in the present problem. Of course, 85(5) simply has no operation in the situation we're dealing with."
01:33:50.700,01:34:03.690,spk_0,"I mean, you have to say that if the tolerated trespasser applies and goes to court, but he hasn't quite got his judgment, and dies, that's it."
01:34:04.060,01:34:57.790,spk_3,"Yes, I do have to say that, but I do say that. But my learned friend is not making a submission that anybody can make the application under 85(2), 85(3) rather, the submission will be plainly misconceived in my submission. It's the as he himself, says the application, the ability to make the application is an adjunct of the original secure tenancy. It's designed to secure the rights of the secure tenant. We're not we're not faced with a submission that the person, a successor and as a result of that status alone, make the application, so he has to construct an edifice in which the right to make the application can be disposed of by will or on intestacy. And he has to do that in our submission that's just inconsistent with the scheme. But"
01:34:57.790,01:35:00.450,spk_1,"it is possible for the landlord to apply under 85(2)."
01:35:01.350,01:35:08.540,spk_3,"Yes, but the landlord will be will meet the landlord condition in the"

01:35:10.510,01:35:25.370,spk_3,"80. Yes. It isn't there in this clip it in the Appendix, the landlord meets the landlord condition. So an application by the landlord is an obvious adjunct of the statutory regime."

01:35:38.170,01:35:43.010,spk_3,"I'm not answering that one way or the other."
01:35:45.340,01:35:46.840,spk_1,"Why not?"

01:35:49.350,01:35:56.130,spk_2,"It doesn't rule it out and reasons for thinking it ought to be permitting it to be done."
01:35:56.810,01:36:27.050,spk_3,"It certainly doesn't rule it out. And there are certainly policy reasons for assuming that it should be allowed under the scheme. But presumably we are envisaging a situation where proceedings have been bought for a possession of a dwelling house let under a secure tenancy, the husband then leaves. If that's the situation we're dealing with. Husband then dies. Well,"
01:36:27.050,01:36:58.500,spk_1,"the odd thing is, husband then leaves. Section 81 is no longer complied with. There are oddities about Section 85(5). Husband leaves, tenant Condition is no longer fulfilled, and yet wife is allowed to go to court and say, let's please suspend the possession order"

01:37:34.620,01:38:08.990,spk_1,"suppose the only point I'm trying to get, sort of struggle towards, which is quite apart from trying to understand it, is that rather illustrates that there are circumstances in which this beast, the secure tenancy, has got a life of its own outside the presence of the original tenant. I don't mean the secure tenant, I mean 85(2) and for that matter 4 has got a life outside the presence of the original secure tenant."
01:38:09.820,01:38:12.060,spk_3,"But because 85(5) says so."

01:38:24.760,01:38:54.920,spk_3,"Barry, sorry Mr. Allen Austin could have made a will. It's highly unlikely, obviously. Could have made a will saying I bequeath to my Aunt Mabel the right to make an application under 85(2), absolutely no basis for, in the scheme for saying that it's possible to make, to assign or devolve by will that right."
01:38:55.160,01:38:58.110,spk_0,"Does somebody have to make an application. Can the court not work?"

01:39:37.760,01:39:39.370,spk_0,"argument. Very"
01:39:39.370,01:39:42.010,spk_3,"deliberately. Not my learned friend's argument. Why is it"

01:39:52.590,01:40:15.840,spk_3,"it's got to be brought before the court. Somehow or another, the issue has to arise in front of the court and short of somebody filling out an application form, saying I want this order and I'm entitled to it or it is possible to give it to me because of my status as X or Y you never get that. But"
01:40:15.850,01:40:31.460,spk_4,"if a tolerated, if a tolerated trespasser dies, it is not unreasonable. Forget about beneficial interest and that it is not unreasonable that his duly constituted Personal Representative, if he has one"

01:40:32.290,01:41:21.330,spk_4,"likely, a close relative appointed by the court to represent the estate should have some sort of status in order to deal with the local authority landlord. I mean that's reasonable enough, isn't it? There may be claims, one way or the other for breaches of repairing covenants or rent or whatever, and if you once accept which is not a very big step that someone representing the estate can reasonably expect after the tolerated trespasser's death to be there talking to the landlord. Well, it's not a very big step from that to say that the County Court should recognise him as representing the estate for the purposes of 82(2) is it?"
01:41:24.710,01:41:42.330,spk_3,"It was crucial, it's the well, he can only be recognised, he can only be representing the estate. It comes back to the fundamental question. If there is an interest capable of passing to that, to the personal representative."
01:41:42.340,01:41:43.370,spk_1,"I'm not sure"
01:41:43.370,01:42:42.380,spk_4,"about that analogy, which will probably not be familiar to you at all. But it would be very familiar if you dealt with personal injury cases of for a long, long time. It was the case that if you were killed in a fatal accident, your estate had no claim that the law has now been changed. But Lord Campbell's Act, the first of the Fatal Accidents Acts, brought in the notion that even though your estate had no claim that your dependents did, but the fact is that the normal Plaintiff in an action of that sort was the Personal Representative, even though it wasn't an asset of the estate at all. That's just one example, but one very familiar in personal injury litigation, where you forget about beneficial interest, it's simply the law recognises the Personal Representative is the person to bring this action."
01:42:43.280,01:42:53.000,spk_3,"Being an identifiable action, on Your Lordship's example. I understand what your logic is putting to me. The dependence do have a cause of action."

01:42:55.200,01:43:05.230,spk_4,"Similarly, it might be said the successor has a statutory right to follow on the tenancy, if you can get it reinstated."
01:43:05.240,01:43:37.220,spk_3,"That's my Lord, Lord Browne's, not necessarily proving it's wrong. That's the same point as my Lord, Lord Browne's point, which is that there's nothing to prevent the successor, him or herself appearing personally in front of the court in their own right to make the application. We say that's contrary to the scheme. If it's not, then we don't need the edifice of the estate in the, on the way to it."
01:43:38.120,01:44:28.890,spk_1,"That's what's rather worrying me, really. If one looks at, if there are no express restrictions on who can make bring the matter of 85(2) or (4) before the court, there may be some implied ones. It could be the original parties to the agreement or the estate of the original party. One of them, if that was an individual or it could be other wife, the former wife as we know, or why not the person who, if it were reinstated, would be entitled to succeed to it. Why can that person not do it?"
01:44:28.900,01:45:04.220,spk_3,"We need to go back to basics. The reason where this argument is taking place is because the statutory machinery, which is designed to deal with succession, has drafted, if Burrows is correct on the basis that it does not apply in a situation where the tenants and secure tenancy has already been brought to an end. So Section 89 which is the way in which the statute deals with the position, does not apply. That's the starting point. But"
01:45:04.230,01:45:20.110,spk_1,"the going back point is that because of Burrows or Thompson, we then have this creature of something that dies and can be brought back to life. Yes,"
01:45:20.110,01:45:24.890,spk_3,"brought back to life in accordance with the machinery of Section 85"
01:45:24.940,01:45:25.210,spk_1,"which"
01:45:25.210,01:45:45.450,spk_3,"includes 85(5) but does not include any other provisions enabling anybody else to make the application under 85(2) and your Ladyship's approach 85(5) would not be necessary because anybody with an obvious interest in the law generally could make the application under 85(2)."
01:45:45.460,01:46:13.780,spk_1,"That was one of my reasons for asking yesterday for the case that 85(5) was the response to, which I think was Pen and Dunn. But I haven't had time to look it up for myself. I know it was a response to a case and obviously the reasoning, which led to that conclusion that the wife couldn't apply after her husband had left. And although she got as against the husband the status of a remove ability."
01:46:15.350,01:46:20.400,spk_3,"Whatever prompts 85(5), it is an answer to Your Ladyship's question."

01:46:26.110,01:46:51.070,spk_3,"But the fact is that if 85(2) is at large i.e. anybody can make the application and you don't need 85(5). Simply redundant, then 85(5) is dealing with with a situation where"

Its occupation of the matrimonial legislation would, on the sort of approach that Your Ladyship and the rest of the court are developing against me, would have an obvious status to draw to the court's attention.

01:47:40.110,01:47:40.860,spk_3,"Yeah,"
01:47:41.390,01:47:55.240,spk_1,"the reason it was necessary to drag her in this way was decisions about what she was entitled to under the matrimonial [inaudible]. Well, not as the case."
01:47:56.690,01:48:03.040,spk_3,"I think I can't do better than say, the scheme of the statute is, in"
01:48:03.040,01:48:04.270,spk_2,"fact,"
01:48:04.280,01:48:07.730,spk_3,"that the succession takes"
01:48:07.730,01:48:08.690,spk_2,"place"
01:48:08.700,01:48:22.480,spk_3,"only where, at the time of death, there is a secure tenancy. That's what Section 89 says, and if Burrows is right,"
01:48:23.910,01:48:24.120,spk_4,"the"
01:48:24.120,01:48:29.960,spk_3,"intended consequence of that is that there is no succession if at the moment of death, there is no secure Tenancy."
01:48:32.620,01:49:01.830,spk_2,"There is one. I hope I'm not interrupting. There's one other oddity that Mr. Luba draws our attention to yesterday, which is Section 91(3)(c). It's just an example of situations envisaged where the tenant has actually died, and yet an assignment after death can take effect. There it is. It's."
01:49:02.350,01:49:03.510,spk_3,"Not before death."
01:49:03.510,01:49:04.120,spk_2,"Before death."
01:49:04.490,01:49:06.920,spk_3,"It's an assignment before deaths."
01:49:08.050,01:49:08.670,spk_2,"Yes,"
01:49:08.970,01:49:11.790,spk_3,"to a person who would be entitled to succeed."
01:49:13.350,01:49:14.020,spk_4,"Mm hmm."
01:49:14.030,01:50:08.330,spk_3,"And in my submission, all of this is part and parcel of the same structure. In order for this to be in play, you need a secure tenancy at the moment of the assignment. Indeed, if we're looking at it through Mr. Luba's eyes rather than the more broad perspective than anybody can make the application under 82, 85(2). 91 is in my favour because what it demonstrates is that security is not a matter that can be assigned except in accordance with the precise rules of the statute, which admittedly do include 91(3)(c). But you still need to be a secure tenancy, a secure tenant at the moment of"
01:50:08.330,01:50:09.480,spk_2,"assignment."
01:50:11.950,01:51:29.850,spk_3,"Yes. If you're looking at it from Mr. Luba's perspective, that is, you're looking to see whether or not the right to the application under 82(2) is capable of being devolved by to the estate, either by intestacy or by will. 91(1) based on point of against that in our submission, because what it makes it crystal clear that you cannot assign during life a secure tenancy except in accordance with the terms of the statute. So as to repeat, our view of the statutory scheme is that one has a whole clutch of provisions which deal with the devolution of the secure tenancy 87, 89, 90, 91."
01:51:30.620,01:51:30.890,spk_1,"But"
01:51:30.900,01:52:11.640,spk_3,"all of them a) demonstrate the secure tenancy cannot devolve except in accordance with the terms of the statute and b) assumed the existence of a secure tenancy at the moment of the devolution. And we say that that following Burrows is indeed the statutory scheme. When"
01:52:11.640,01:52:18.760,spk_1,"did the reference to the Matrimonial Causes Act hop in? That hopped in between 1980 and 1985 as well, didn't it?"
01:52:20.630,01:52:29.010,spk_3,"Yes, I don't know. I don't have the material to give the answer either, because I don't think the notes."
01:52:29.020,01:53:25.070,spk_1,"I'm not sure that it's possible to accept by looking at the 1980 Act, which doesn't, which is very different on this assignment point. And the only point I'm trying to make is that some, the Family Court held that a secure tenancy was property for the purposes of being able to make a property adjustment order, which meant that that had then to be put these. Obviously, somebody decided they didn't want to reverse that. It had to be accommodated in the assignment provisions. And I think that is one of the things that happened between 80 and 85 from recollection. So it's quite interesting seeing that at least one set of courts, we're looking at a secure tenancy as a secure tenancy, having enduring qualities transmissible qualities."
01:53:25.080,01:54:07.900,spk_3,"If, the only difficulty with that is that the status of security, undoubtedly property hasn't been terminated, the term certainly hasn't been forfeit or the periodic tenancy brought to an end in according to the provisions of Section 82 the property out there, the statute simply provides that it ceases to be a secure tenancy on assignment or if it vests in the estate of somebody, invests in somebody following death who is not a successor, then it loses the personal status of security."
01:54:08.830,01:54:09.060,spk_1,"No"
01:54:09.060,01:54:23.170,spk_3,"difficulty with that at all. But that's in a way, my point, that all demonstrates the personal nature of the security, which is not capable of being transmitted by will or at all."
01:54:23.180,01:54:44.740,spk_1,"But my point was that if that were as simple as that, there would be no point in the court ordering the transfer of property under the Matrimonial Causes Act. Because the moment the court ordered the person who had that personal status to transfer it to somebody else, it would go and there'd be absolutely no point in doing"
01:54:44.740,01:54:49.990,spk_3,"it. No, I may be being slow. No I may be being."
01:54:51.100,01:54:52.040,spk_5,"If"
01:54:52.050,01:55:17.850,spk_3,"you envisage a periodic tenancy, the tenant condition is met at the time that is created by the presence of the husband in the home. There is a need to exercise the jurisdiction of the matrimonial courts, and that period transfer is transferred to somebody else who meets the tenancy condition. I can't see why that isn't itself a secure tenancy or"
01:55:18.610,01:56:02.420,spk_1,"But the point I'm trying to make is that the secure tenant is the husband, shall we say, though actually, these days it's usually the other way around, but the husband, so he fulfils the Tenant Condition. The whole premise of this is that husband and wife are separating, and the court orders the transfer of the tenancy to the wife. Obviously the husband is no longer there, and the court is doing that on the basis that the security continues because there'd be no point in doing it if it was simply a periodic tenancy, because the landlord could bring it to an end by serving the notice to quit in the ordinary way and there will be no security, and the court will be beating the air."
01:56:02.530,01:56:23.760,spk_3,"If the court has transferred the property, which is the periodic tenancy to somebody who meets the tenant condition, then the result will be a secure tenancy, maybe arguments about whether it's a new Tenancy or the same Tenancy. But in any event, the tenant condition is met at that stage by the occupation of the wife."
01:56:24.620,01:56:27.230,spk_1,"Having probably not been met at the time. And"
01:56:27.240,01:56:34.350,spk_3,"that's the problem that Your Ladyship identified about 85(5), which I think the only answer I've got is that 85(5) exists, but it does"
01:56:34.350,01:56:37.920,spk_1,"exist. But then, so does 91(3)(b)."
01:56:39.520,01:56:40.900,spk_3,"Certainly."
01:56:44.840,01:57:14.830,spk_1,"Now you could say, of course, the family courts have been getting it wrong all these years because that's perfectly possible scenario. I have a feeling it was a case called Thompson and Thompson where the High Court decided that they could order and of course, there has been subsequent legislation on the basis of it, because it was extended to cohabitants in the Family Law Act 1996."
01:57:17.880,01:58:09.450,spk_3,"Look, I think in fact, those are my submissions on issue two, repeat that the statutory scheme envisages. This is all the various moments of transition there is in existence and actual secure tenancy. Subject to the quirk about 85(5). Well issue three is the human rights issue. The answer we've given to that in the printed case is Capecchi, and it's as simple as that. And in our submission, that remains a perfectly good answer. In fact, I think we set out that adoption in domestic law of Capecchi by the House of Lords in a case called RJM."
01:58:20.030,01:58:26.500,spk_2,"So it doesn't guarantee a right to acquire property. Exactly. You look at the property there and it's protected"
01:58:28.570,01:58:39.420,spk_3,"so that if we're right on issues one and two, there is no property right of which either of the Mr. Austins is being deprived."
01:58:40.700,01:58:43.660,spk_1,"Mr. Luba's argument that we should construe"
01:58:44.680,01:58:49.370,spk_3,"is circular. Is entirely circular. Absolutely entirely circular. I"
01:58:49.380,01:58:52.030,spk_1,"think he admitted that"
01:58:52.280,01:58:54.310,spk_3,"I think he said it sounded circular."
01:58:55.220,01:58:59.790,spk_2,"We"
01:58:59.790,01:59:21.420,spk_3,"say that is the end of it, that doesn't demonstrate that we are right on issues one and two. But if we are right on issues one and two, then Article 131 as the court below record that there is no Article 14 argument, I'll keep quiet. There is no Article 14 argument."
01:59:23.790,01:59:40.970,spk_0,"Are there any other problems? I mean, if you're wrong on point two? And what are the, I mean, I don't know how you put it, but is there a problem if you're wrong? I mean, what's the problem?"
01:59:40.980,02:00:42.960,spk_3,"The problem, I really do see, is the, can be seen in the version of (2) that the court is attracted by is the idea that the estate can make the application. Then the problem is simply, well I say simply, the problem will be to know on what principles the estate should act, so it may well feel it is a good idea whoever is the Personal Representative or whatever to make the application, but they may not. I simply simply doesn't know. I understand Lord Walker's point. A common place will be the person who is actually an occupation will succeed in an application to reappoint made a Personal Representative, in which case there's an identity of interest between I may not be he in his capacity as Personal Representative will feel inclined to make the application because it benefits him personally. It's not, obviously, for the advantage of the"
02:00:42.960,02:00:44.370,spk_5,"estate, it's"
02:00:44.370,02:00:56.870,spk_3,"not an advantage on behalf of the estate at all. Could it be a disadvantage of the estate? Well, it might be, well, this is an outstanding amount of arrears."
02:00:56.950,02:01:46.020,spk_4,"It's possible to imagine a fanciful example where the tolerated trespasser, even though he can't pay his rent, has made a will and appointed an executor and left his entire estate to the RSPCA, which says, why should we risk costs and going to the County Court to try and preserve rights? Well, the answer is, in that case, the brother who is there would have to say, all right, somehow, rather, I'll find the money to give you an indemnity of your costs and and if the Personal Representative still refused to go to court, then the brother would go to court and say, I'm not the Personal Representative, but what I ask for the purposes of this application to be appointed to represent the estate, its fanciful. But there is an answer in that sort of situation."
02:01:46.140,02:01:57.800,spk_3,"But I think that analysis is reinforcing our basic perspective, which is that there isn't any automatic identity of interest between the estate and the successor."
02:01:57.820,02:02:09.190,spk_4,"The successor is relying on the successors own rights and not not on anything inherited from the estate. Well,"
02:02:09.200,02:02:53.740,spk_3,"exactly. But it may be on the example, the particular example I accept is fanciful, but on the example he will be making an application which is contrary to the interests of the estate. There's no reason why it's for the benefit of the estate qua estate that the that the Lazarus Order is made in order to guarantee succession. That's the fundamental problem, obviously, in a commonplace situation there will be, and that may not be a difficulty. But what Mr. Luba's argument envisages is that an application is made by the estate qua estate in order to benefit something that isn't the estate. As"
02:02:53.740,02:02:58.110,spk_4,"I said that there is a very familiar parallel of that under the Fatal Accidents Act. It's"
02:02:58.270,02:03:00.080,spk_3,"not to the detriment of the estate. Well,"
02:03:00.080,02:03:32.520,spk_4,"it may be if the estate of someone who has died in a fatal accident has been left entirely to charity, they could say, why on earth should we risk costs of losing a claim for the of losing a claim, which is not going to bring us any benefit at all? And in that case, it would then be necessary for someone else to be appointed to bring those proceedings. It's quite quite parallel isn't it?"
02:03:33.430,02:04:01.050,spk_3,"In that situation, you wouldn't, he wouldn't be bringing the proceedings. I'm only working off Your Lordships' description of the scheme for which I apologise, but in Your Lordships' example. If the estate it's not, the Personal Representative is not willing to bring the action under the Fatal Accidents Act to benefit the dependence, then presumably you would solve that by appointing somebody to represent the dependence in respect of the causes of action."
02:04:01.900,02:04:15.360,spk_4,"In fact, in that case, the statute says that if the Personal Representatives won't act within six months, then the dependence can so it does, it does cover it, but it is nevertheless a comparable"
02:04:15.360,02:05:18.730,spk_3,"situation. But in my submission, that's my point though, what that drafting does is recognise that you're dealing with two different things on the first place. You're dealing with the causes of action in the dependence, which may be conveniently dealt with by the Personal Representative acting. And secondly, you're dealing with the interests of the estate, which may or may not coincide. Now, Mr. Luba's construction is to create an interest by constructive, a constructive interest can be transmitted to the estate and then assume that the estate will make the application, which does not benefit it at all qua Estate. It's plainly, except to the extent that you assume that the tenant has died and who had lived with his relatives for a certain period of time would normally want, for family reasons, the succession to take place. But there's no other identity of interest."
02:05:23.140,02:05:23.360,spk_0,"In"
02:05:23.360,02:05:41.110,spk_3,"our submission. That's the fundamental reason why the why this is a construction to defeat the characteristics of the scheme, as Lord Justice Longmore said. Well, I think those are my submissions. I don't think I need to add anything on issue four as my position was correctly summarised yesterday."
02:05:43.410,02:05:44.810,spk_2,"Thank you very much. Mr. Kelly?"

02:06:00.400,02:06:07.080,spk_2,"Well, I make it, actually I think we're going to go on until one o'clock anyway. So you've got 55 minutes, which might be enough"
02:06:07.670,02:06:08.250,spk_3,"You won't need that."
02:06:09.360,02:06:13.980,spk_5,"I thought, My Lord, given the indication that the court wish to rise early for lunch. No"
02:06:14.050,02:06:24.790,spk_2,"we originally were. I should have made myself clear, but we no longer need to rise at 12.30 so we can run on until one o'clock. Thank you. Then we can come back at two o'clock if you really want us to do that."
02:06:25.030,02:06:51.920,spk_5,"I shall not ask the court certainly do that. And I shall certainly seek to conclude my submissions before one o'clock. My Lords, My Lady, before I embarked on my replies friends very clear and characteristically, succinctly expressed submissions. May I make good the invitations that various members of the court put to me yesterday for additional materials to be supplied in the form of as it were, some homework. Can I pass that forward at this juncture?"

02:07:00.150,02:07:02.490,spk_5,"we did the homework."

02:07:32.380,02:08:01.640,spk_5,"three specific questions which were raised yesterday. The first set of questions related to what we've been describing the Section 85(5), and I'll say something more about those in a moment. The second was to provide the actual date for the 2008 Act. So we've done that by providing the long title, and I was asked to provide the Housing Act of 1988. That is the assured tenancy regime, and I've done that also. I hope those were the materials required. If there's any further we can supply, then of course we will at the invitation of"
02:08:01.670,02:08:02.100,spk_3,"the court."
02:08:04.830,02:08:18.260,spk_5,"Can I come back to such of that material as is relevant to my learned friend's submissions in the course of replying to them and invite the court to put those materials aside for just one moment. My Lords, my Lady, may I deal with my learned friend's responses"
02:08:18.270,02:08:19.050,spk_3,"in the order in which he"
02:08:19.050,02:09:17.170,spk_5,"developed them. First issue one and he articulated as his primary case in answer to our issue one proposition that this was all too late now it would be wrong to revisit, even if it were otherwise appropriate to do so. The interpretation and construction of Section 82(2) and indeed its place in the 1985 Act. My learned friend's opening gambit on that, in developing that general response was that my client was seeking relief in what is effectively the dying days or last gasp of the statutory scheme. In my respectful submission that is not right at all. The statutory scheme in relation to secure tenancies remains safely in place and on course, the effect of this court finding for us on issue one"
02:09:17.180,02:09:17.750,spk_3,"would"
02:09:17.750,02:09:51.660,spk_5,"be that the day after Judgment, hundreds of thousands of people who live in Council and Housing Association property would awake to find that they were no longer in limbo. But we're once again tenants of their landlords. That's not a dying days syndrome. That is a restoration of the status quo ante, which is with respect, precisely what issue one is designed to achieve. Some of"
02:09:51.670,02:09:52.460,spk_3,"the"
02:09:52.470,02:12:11.600,spk_5,"people who would wake up on the day after the house's, the court's judgement, if it found in favour of us on issue one would be only marginally better off. They would be people who could have in any event got their tenancies back on individual applications under Section 85. They could be people who are satisfied with the replacement tenancy regime in Part 2, the greatest beneficiaries will be the failed successes of which the present Appellant is a singularly good representative. So we say, it may be becoming late. But it's certainly better than never. And it has significant gains that my learned friend then sought to meet the point that the decision of the House of Lords in Knowsley and White had done much the same thing in relation to assured tenants. And it is right with respect to remind the court that before the House of Lords handed down its speeches in December 2008, everybody in the Assured Tenancy sector who had been subject of a possession order since 1989 had thought that they were no longer tenants. There were tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people who were ex-assured, tolerated trespassers immediately before this house handed down, that the house handed down its speeches. In December 2008, the effect was very much the same according to large numbers of occupiers, the rights that it had always believed that they had and that the house in Knowsley decided on a true construction statute they had retained. From my learned friend's with respect to him to suggest that the tolerated trespasser problem in the Assured Tenancy sector had only been alive for a few months. So not many people have been affected by it. The court will recall that the prospect of tolerated trespassers in the Assured Tenancy sector had been alive since the decision of the Court of Appeal in Artesian which the House of Lords took the trouble to reverse expressly in Knowsley and that decision had been given in 2000. It was reported in 2000. It may have been decided earlier. Which case was that?"
02:12:13.660,02:12:20.240,spk_2,"Artesian in 1999. Yes, I see. Overruled. Yes,"
02:12:20.250,02:12:34.710,spk_5,"Yes. So the distinction my learned friend sought to draw with great respect to him as between the incident case and its effect and Knowsley and White and its effects is, if I may respectfully say so rather more limited than he suggests."
02:12:37.760,02:12:38.130,spk_2,"However"
02:12:38.130,02:12:43.490,spk_0,"I'm sorry, I don't know, I'm just looking at Paragraph 74. Lord Neuberger, I'm not quite sure how you."

02:12:59.670,02:13:05.330,spk_0,"doesn't seem to make much of Artesian, and he puts it in a crisp parenthesis at the end. But basically,"
02:13:05.330,02:13:05.840,spk_2,"he's"

There are huge plus points for taking that approach. In my respectful submission, I'll deal with my learned friend's negative points in just a moment.

02:19:04.110,02:19:06.849,spk_2,"Well, that's what Section 21(2) seems to say."
02:19:06.860,02:20:49.430,spk_5,"Yes, exactly, Sir, My Lord. So we've already had a situation where housing officers are struggling to manage the idea that there are tolerated trespassers in their stock and have been for the last 30 years. Now they're going to be told, you will have people in your stock who are replacement tenants, assuming you can work out what rights they get under Paragraph 18, based on what rights they had under their previous tenancy, they may, in addition, have some rights as a result of Paragraph 21. The recipe for chaos is enormous. The only upside of Schedule 11 is that identified by my learned friend, and that is that it preserves for landlords the existence of a termination period, the gap between the loss of the old tenancy and the commencement of the new replacement tenancy on the 20th of May 2009, but is right in my respectful submission before considering his submissions, that it's very important to protect the advantage that landlords have gained from the termination period to recognise that the termination period is a windfall. If we are right on issue one as a matter of construction of Section 82 there never should have been termination periods. My learned friend builds his case on prejudice on a windfall that social landlords obtained, and that windfall only arises. We know from what were unintended consequences of the interpretation by the courts of the statutory provision."

Could I invite the court to go to Page 4, where the heading executive summary appears over a Paragraph 8 and this is the executive summary of the overall exercise. Paragraph 10 says there was strong support for amending the legislation to restore the tenancies of all existing tolerated trespassers as being the simplest practical solution to the problem. The paragraph then continues, and my learned friend was right to draw attention to it, that some concerns were raised about the retrospective nature of the proposal. And nearly all respondents agreed that landlords should be protected from liability for actions taken in accordance with the law at the time protected from actions they had taken certainly, no assent for the proposition that they should be exempted from liabilities. Can I go then to the government's position at Paragraph 12 on the following page? Having summarised the"

We recognise that the creation by the courts of tolerated trespassers causes serious problems for tenants and landlords alike. In recognition of the seriousness of this issue and in light of a clear response to consultation, we've decided to resolve the tolerated trespasser issue both for the future and in respect of existing tolerated trespassers, will use the opportunity provided by the bill to amend the legislation to prevent the creation of future tolerated trespassers and restore tenancy status to all existing tolerated trespassers. That was the government's response to the consultation exercise which have been undertaken. And that is why when my learned friend came to show the court the non-statutory guidance subsequently issued, it is my respectful submission, a useful indicator of what the policy intention was. Could I invite the court to a paragraph of the guidance which is loose, which my learned friend put up yesterday? But it's a paragraph to which he didn't take the court."

02:25:31.050,02:27:08.410,spk_5,"Paragraph 50, Page 18. It's headed terms and conditions of the new tenancy, and it says this as already stated the aim of the provisions, that's the provision in Schedule 11, is to provide, so far as possible that both landlord and tenant are in the same position as they would have been had the tenant not become a tolerated trespasser, and that neither is disadvantaged by the changes. That's the underlying premise of the approach to Schedule 11. It is understandable, however, that landlords lobbied and successfully lobbied to retain the benefit of the windfall that they had achieved from the existence of the termination period. And my Lord, Lord Browne asked my learned friend to identify what other benefits are issues there were, and he candidly said that the prime one is that there was no liability for repair in relation to the gap period, and that's what the landlords wanted to hang onto as the benefit they got from the windfall. Well, My Lords, My Lady, I invite this court are not to be tempted, off course, by the fact that finding for us on issue one will deprive landlords of that windfall, not least for this reason that that would be an unbalanced result. Because the occupier who has been in occupation without the benefit of the repairing obligations has been obliged to pay the full rent or the equivalent by way of mean profits."
02:27:09.730,02:27:12.690,spk_2,"Counterpart would normally be the repairing obligation."
02:27:12.690,02:28:24.050,spk_5,"Exactly so My Lord, the counterpart of the payment of rent by the quotes tenant for these purposes or the payments of mean profits would ordinarily be that they get something back for it. So this is a windfall, which is a double whammy for the former landlord. They are no longer the landlord, but they continue to receive, sometimes by dint of the court's order, the current rent and or mean profits. Now it is that double whammy benefit for landlords rising from the construction in Thompson and Elmbridge. That is the primary loss the social landlord sector would suffer if this house were to hold Schedule 11 redundant. The double whammy windfall may, in any event, has been an entirely pyrrhic gain for social landlords, as Lord Neuberger makes clear in Knowsley and White, in Knowsley, which is behind Tab 18 Lord Neuberger, in as it were in passing, noted that this proposition"

That's the defective Premises Act in this connection see Rogers and a case called Brickham Investments. But the point is not"

02:29:05.450,02:29:53.460,spk_5,"and indeed it's not. And it's yet another piece of satellite litigation that will now arise if the tolerated trespasser scenario is retained. Because, as that paragraph suggests, there is a strong argument that if a landlord receives rent payable from a tolerated trespasser, then obligations in relation to repair are maintained in any event, there is already standing for hearing in the Court of Appeal, a case which will examine the application of Paragraph 83 simply as it were suggests in my respectful submission this problem of tolerated trespassers, unless addressed only see one in this appeal will again continue to spawn this sort of satellite litigation."
02:29:53.470,02:29:56.340,spk_2,"So we read that last sentence with the previous one."
02:29:56.560,02:29:58.200,spk_5,"Yes, My Lord. It's"
02:29:58.200,02:29:59.150,spk_2,"really making the point."
02:29:59.160,02:31:41.290,spk_5,"Yes, really goes as a whole that one can see the injustice on the one hand of saying there is no obligation. Even though the landlord were, as it were, still continuing to receive the remuneration. In any event, the windfall has always been capable of being taken away on a successful application under Section 85 to revive the tenancy. But the simple fact is that so many in the sector are in ignorance of this tolerated trespasser status, and so few applications had been made that this has not been an opportunity pursued very widely. There is, in our respectful submission, no good reason why a combination of landlord and tenant ignorance and misunderstanding which has prevented tenants getting their tenancies back in that way, should now justify the continuance of this windfall gain for landlords, particularly where Parliament's starting point on the basis of the government's own statutory guidance is that it's trying to put everybody back to how they were. There is, in my respectful submission, a further reason why the court should not be deterred by the loss, which my learned friend Mr. Drabble identifies. And that is because the loss he identifies is wholly transient and temporary. But the court will appreciate that Schedule 11 creates replacement tenancies from the 20th of May 2009. From that date, the tenants have had the benefit of repairing provisions, repairing protection"
02:31:45.100,02:31:46.010,spk_1,"they can"
02:31:46.010,02:32:57.940,spk_5,"if they succeed in their application under Schedule 11 add a period before the 20th of May 2009 and, as it were, enhance their compensation by taking back their rights. At present, they could do that for up to six years from the date they bring their claim. The most recent year, 2009/10 will be covered by the replacement tenancy, and they'll need the benefit of Schedule 11 for the prior five years. But with every day that passes, they have less need of the old tenancy, the gap period and eventually on what I calculate to be the 20th of May 2015. Schedule 11, Paragraph 21 will cease to have any benefit at all because any claim brought on or after that date, which seeks the revival of the old tenancy, will be relying on a period prior to the Limitation Period. So Schedule 11, Paragraph 21 which my learned friend is so keen to preserve, will, in fact, in a short period of years, now four or five, become entirely redundant."

02:33:03.830,02:33:14.180,spk_5,"of May 2009 is the commencement date of Schedule 11 yes my Lord, and that is to be found from the Commencement Order, which we have in the bundle at Tab 49."

In my respectful submission, my learned friend was right to identify that the core beneficiary of this change is the landlord who hasn't prepared, and the core beneficiary of success on the appeal is the hundreds of people who are failed successors."

02:34:15.070,02:35:09.960,spk_5,"Well, My Lord says, dispossessed. If they were dispossessed on execution of the Possession Order, their tenancy will have terminated. That is precisely the construction of Section 82(2) for which I contend, if they have gone out voluntarily, then they will have surrendered. If they had entered into a new tenancy agreement, there will have been a novation. It is exceptionally difficult. And it's the difficulty that both I and my learned friend Mr. Drabble have found in identifying for the benefit of the court and the application of the issue one point whether there are any other losers or gainers. And that's why we focused from the landlord side on the possible liability for disrepair and on the occupier side on the loss of gain for those who are failed successes. My Lords and My Lady, were encouraged by my learned friend Mr. Drabble to hold back. I'm sorry."

02:36:00.980,02:38:11.440,spk_5,"all? Well, if I may respectfully say, I'm happy to meet the extrapolation that arises from My Lords questions so far as I'm able, it may be possible to think of a situation in which someone can say I relied on advice from you, which was wrong, and acting on that I left. And that would be no different from the position of any lawyer who acted on who gave advice based on what they understood to be the present position of the law, which was later clarified. That's the only situation in which there could, as it were be, come back as a result of the individual having left. If they leave of their own motion, then no such comeback arises. I wish to reassure, my Lord, if I can that I didn't fail to do that piece of homework. And like Mr. Drabble, I have been trying to find other examples and I haven't been able. My Lords and Lady kindly gave attention to decisions of the House of Lords yesterday, the Barrister Immunity case and the Rights of Way case, which we have both had an opportunity to consider overnight, with great indications. In terms of the Barrister Immunity case. I think, my Lord, Lord Hope, when mentioning Hall and Simons to my learned friend was met by the rejoinder from Mr. Drabble that that may have been a case in which there have been no subsequent legislation. After the house had fixed the policy of immunity back in the 1960s. In fact, an examination of the case shows that there was some statutory intervention on the question of immunity. My Lords and My Lady will recall that in the Legal Services Act 1990 Parliament expressly extended to Solicitor Advocates what had been perceived to be the immunity of Barrister Advocates. And in Lord Steyn's speech, Page 683 and Lord Hoffman's speech Page 704 both pay attention to the question of whether the house should hold back. Because there had been some Parliamentary intervention in the field and for the reasons they give, both explained that they should not. And"

02:39:05.110,02:40:25.730,spk_5,"have to change the name of the Court of Appeal decision from the name I think hanging in that case to the name Thompson in this case to be almost on all fours. And it was that proposition which this, which the House rejected as my Lord, Lord Walker, drew attention in the course of the speeches in particular of Lords Hope and Scott. Of course, that was a different case in that the proposition of law has been stated by the Court of Appeal and not previously approved in any considered judgment by the House of Lords. And I do remind the court with respect that this instant case is not that far different. Thompson and Elmbridge was never re-argued in this in the House of Lords. It was treated by the parties in Burrows and Print as having been correctly decided, and I don't seek to develop that point further. My Lords, My Lady, in an attempt to make good my a timetable, may move swiftly to the secondary way in which my learned friend sought to answer our case on issue one and that was the issue of construction in relation to Section 82(2). Can I invite the court for this purpose is just once again please to turn up Section 82 in Volume 4 behind Tab"

02:40:33.950,02:40:34.230,spk_2,"My learned"
02:40:34.380,02:42:32.780,spk_5,"friend suggested that we had not identified any alternative construct of Section 82(2) from that adopted by Lord Justice Russell in Thompson and Elmbridge. With respect to him, my learned friend was right to record that What we have done is rely entirely upon the construction identified by Lord Neuberger as being the subject of a powerful case in Knowsley and White. And it is that which we seek to pursue. Could I invite the attention of the House to what must have been the situation and function of Section 82 before we come to the exact words used. Parliamentary draftsman in 1980 when Parliament was giving security of tenure to tenants of council houses needed to devise, obviously, a textural means of doing that. He was struggling with a new methodology because Parliament had decided not to adopt the same route as had been adopted for the Rent Acts, that is to say, to allow the landlord to determine the contractual relation and then spring up a personal right to retain occupation. The Housing Act of 1980 becoming the 1985 Act operated differently. It's device was to allow the continuance of the contractual tenancy and prevent it from termination under what became Section 82 of the Act. The structure of security of tenure, therefore, under the 1985 Act, is to clothe an existing contractual tenancy with a statutory covering of protection completely, as it were different in methodology, although in outcome the same to the previous Rent Acts. The whole bundle contract, plus statutory"
02:42:32.780,02:42:33.680,spk_1,"rights"
02:42:33.790,02:44:06.490,spk_5,"was to fall and only fall on a landlord's application by the obtaining of an order for possession. And that is what Section 82 its predecessor in the 1980 Act sought to address. As Mr. Drabble put it this morning. The question that these provisions seek to answer is, when does the landlord and tenant relationship end in a secure tenancy case? That's what Parliamentary counsel was tasked with embarking upon, and he had to do that. He had to ask and answer that question because parliament had not left it free as it had in the Rent Acts to the parties themselves to determine the relation on the basis they wished. As my Lady, Lady Hale indicated, nothing in Section 82 prevents the parties otherwise terminating the relation, for example, by the tenant giving notice to quit or by surrendering. Hence, we have the wording of Section 82. In my respectful submission, the words which are actually used there and I don't shy from them I shall address them further in just one moment were settled in this context. First Parliamentary counsel knew that this provision was going to apply to about two million occupiers of social housing, at least at that date. He knew, therefore, that many orders for possession would be sought and obtained, tens of thousands, at least hundreds of thousands."
02:44:06.500,02:44:08.330,spk_3,"Possibly he"
02:44:08.330,02:44:10.600,spk_5,"also knew, based on long"
02:44:10.600,02:44:11.670,spk_3,"experience from the"
02:44:11.670,02:44:24.170,spk_5,"Rent Act situation that very many of the orders that would be obtained would be Suspended Orders. That is the point of Lord Neuberger picks up in Knowsley and White. And"
02:44:24.170,02:44:25.050,spk_3,"he knew"
02:44:25.100,02:44:33.820,spk_5,"that even if the form of possession order obtained was an outright possession order, the landlord would not instantly be able to recover physical possession"
02:44:34.670,02:44:35.160,spk_3,"because"
02:44:35.160,02:44:37.160,spk_5,"the statutory and procedural"
02:44:37.160,02:44:37.890,spk_1,"scheme"
02:44:38.040,02:46:35.590,spk_5,"always included a warrant stage. If the landlord wish to recover possession, a warrant for possession was needed after the order. He must, in my respectful submission, therefore have known that a considerable number of occupiers would remain in occupation, post the making of the order itself. If one had been standing by the shoulder of such draftsman and asked him in 1980. Are you designing a scheme under which those against a possession order is obtained but remain in occupation will be in a legal limbo for years or indefinitely under the shadow of the order? He would have said. Of course not. And if asked to prove that he would have said first, well, that makes a nonsense of the policy of the very legislation on drafting, which is to provide at least equivalent protection for the public sector tenant as the private sector tenant enjoys. Secondly, he would say that can't stand with what I've already written in Section 121? But what he would say positively is all I am doing is I am making it clear that when possession is to be given up in pursuance of the order when that date eventually arrives, both the statute and the contractual tenancy end. And that dovetails with what I've written in Section 85 about the extended discretion ceasing to be available at execution, the person standing over his shoulder may have said, well, no, surely, in Section 82(2) you mean the date that the Judge puts in the possession order at which the draftsman would have said, well, if I have meant that,"
02:46:35.690,02:46:36.600,spk_1,"I would have written it,"
02:46:36.920,02:48:09.500,spk_5,"not least given that I wrote it four lines further on in Section 82 Subsection 3, which provides where a secure tenancy is a tendency for term certain. But with a provision for re entry or forfeiture, the court shall not order possession of the dwelling house in pursuance of that provision. But in a case where the court would have made such an order, it shall instead make an order terminating the tendency on a date specified in the order, he would have said in response to the questions put to him over his shoulder. If I meant the date specified in the order, as opposed to the date on which possession is to be given up in pursuance of the order, that's what I would have written. So in my respectful submission, my learned friend is wrong, both on his first answer to our issue one. And on the second, the court should take the opportunity in my respectful submission to correct the construction of Section 82(2). May I then for my last five or so minutes a deal with my learned friend's submissions on issue two, that is to say, assume we are wrong and Alan Austin's Tenancy was lost. The respondent Mr. Drabble has to establish that it is implicit in the legislation that the extended discretion in Section 85 ceases to be available on the death of a former security. That's what he has to show."
02:48:10.100,02:48:10.400,spk_1,"It's"
02:48:10.400,02:48:45.100,spk_5,"certainly not explicit. If he were explicit, he'd have pointed to the provision he has to establish that it's implicit that Section 85 ceases to be available when the former secure tenant dies. He can't say it ceases to be available when a secure tenant dies, because the legislation envisages the secure tenants death, not ending the tenancy. Even if the secure tenancy has become a contractual tenancy, as we've seen from Section 90 it can survive"
02:48:45.100,02:48:45.800,spk_2,"and vest in the"
02:48:45.800,02:48:56.100,spk_5,"usual way. He's got to say it goes on the death of former secure tenant, although a former secure tenant only"
02:48:56.100,02:48:57.300,spk_1,"exists at all"
02:48:57.300,02:48:59.000,spk_5,"because of Section"
02:48:59.000,02:49:00.200,spk_1,"85,"
02:49:00.400,02:49:15.000,spk_5,"it's because of Section 85. We have tolerated trespassers. The very beneficiaries or all the people created by Section 85 are the people, he says on their death [inaudible] he's got to overcome"
02:49:15.000,02:49:15.900,spk_3,"the presumption"
02:49:16.000,02:50:21.800,spk_5,"that the statutory protection survives death. See Rickless. The position adopted by my learned friend is with respect to him in extreme position, with extreme consequences. Firstly, he appears to accept that the death of the former secure tenant prevents the former secure landlord making the application under Section 85. We can't say that by reference to anything in the statute. Secondly, he's got to say that the court can't make a Section 85 order of its own motion. That's extraordinary. That's not shut out by anything in Section 85. And if I may say so, picking up the theme offered by Lord Walker, it meets with the practical reality that the Judges in the County Courts in this class of case are often having to identify the wind faced with a housing officer on one side and a former secure tenants on the other. Exactly what should happen. Thirdly, it seems extraordinary, given the existence of Section 85(5), which one might"
02:50:21.800,02:50:22.800,spk_1,"think would"
02:50:22.800,02:51:01.100,spk_5,"be particularly useful where there had been a death of the former secure tenant. Even more extraordinary, given that the Parliamentary draftsman will have known that in order to turn out the family left behind, the landlord will always need a warrant for possession. My learned friend is therefore, in the course of his submissions, candidly driven to the proposition that simply death of a former security tenant ends the availability of Section 85. Even if, as my Lord, Lord Browne puts"
02:51:01.100,02:51:02.200,spk_2,"him, he's sitting in"
02:51:02.200,02:51:10.000,spk_5,"court waiting for the Judge to pronounce judgment on his application. It's at that point. I think, that it may be convenient for me to deal"
02:51:10.000,02:51:11.100,spk_4,"very briefly with Section"
02:51:11.100,02:53:14.500,spk_5,"85(5). Why we've got it and what it does. And I hope I've tried to assist the court in that respect by the additional material passed up this morning. I was asked yesterday when Penn and Dunne was decided. I've given the date for that is in fact reported. I have not copied the case. I apologise. If that is unhelpful. I was asked when Section 85(5) got into the statute and what I've reproduced is firstly Section 75 of the 1980 Act, which is the section that put Subsection 5 equivalent into the Rent Acts. I've been at Page 2 of the photocopying using the pagination at the top right hand side included Mr. Arden's, annotation of that change, which refers to Penn and Dunne and explains why it was done. And I've also identified in this cover sheet that the provisions of Section 85(5) have in effect always been there for both secure and assured tenants, as it were from the inception of the regime. I was in difficulty when my Lady, Lady Hale asked me about it yesterday in identifying whether Section 85(5) had been there since secure tenancies and started. And I now know the answers that they are because they were expressly included in Section 87 of the Housing Act 1980 which was the first enactment of the extent discretion now found in Section 85. In the course of exchanges this morning, however, my Lady pressed my learned friend to assist on the question of the interface between matrimonial rights and the statutory regime to secure tenancy. First my Lady put it to my learned friend. How does the tenant fulfil the Tenant Condition if he goes out but his wife remains the answer to that  my Lady. I'm able to give not from any materials before the court, I'm afraid. But the answer is that the Matrimonial Homes Act in Matrimonial Homes Act 1983"
02:53:14.500,02:53:15.400,spk_3,"which was the"
02:53:15.500,02:53:33.900,spk_5,"version in force when the 1985 Act applied expressly provided that matrimonial home rights designated the spouse as the tenant for the purposes of the Tenant Condition. In both the Rent Acts, the Housing Act 1988 and the Housing Act 1985."
02:53:33.900,02:53:35.900,spk_1,"In other words put the spouse in the shoes of the."
02:53:35.900,02:54:17.900,spk_5,"Exactly so my lady. And then if various orders were made under the relevant matrimonial legislation, the same for former spouses eventually cohabiters and as My Lady now appreciates civil partners and so on and so forth. So that's how it worked. That's what made the supplementary decision in Thompson and Elmbridge about Section 85(5) so extraordinary because Parliament had plainly put 85(5) there to deal with exactly that position where one spouse goes the other remains. I'm afraid I must deal with another point that came up this morning raised by my Lord, Lord Hope on Section 91 because I need with respect to my learned friend Mr. Drabble to correct his answer in violation of"
02:54:17.900,02:54:18.900,spk_1,"that"
02:54:18.900,02:54:20.600,spk_5,"Section 91(3)(c)"
02:54:20.600,02:54:21.700,spk_3,"as"
02:54:21.700,02:55:21.000,spk_5,"the court will recall, we went to as an example of a situation in which a secure tenant can assign their secure tenancy. And I hope I didn't give the impression to my Lord that this was a situation in which an assignment could take place after death. The purpose of Section 91(3)(c) is to enable the secure tenant to assign while alive to somebody who would succeed them or could succeed them on death. My learned friend suggested in the course of his reply to my Lord's question on Section 91 that such an assignment could not take place unless the tenancy were secure. I'm sure he did that entirely inadvertently, because the section which says the reverse is only reproduced in the Appendix and not in the version, which is behind Tab"

02:55:36.800,02:55:38.300,spk_2,"Oh, yes, I see."

02:55:41.400,02:56:00.400,spk_5,"of Section 95 is to ensure that if, as it were while you're insecure, you've temporarily gone out of occupation, for example, you assign, then, nevertheless, the restrictions on assignment and the exceptions to them apply with the modifications shown there. And"
02:56:00.400,02:56:04.300,spk_2,"that was in the Act from the start and understands from the derivation provision?"
02:56:04.300,02:56:15.400,spk_5,"Yes, my Lord, Yes, and I think entirely inadvertently. I'm sure Mr. Drabble said tenancies can only be assigned while they're secure. And that's not the case under the statutory regime."
02:56:17.900,02:56:18.900,spk_1,"Finally,"
02:56:18.900,02:56:44.800,spk_5,"in terms of questions on this issue this morning, my Lady asked about the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 and the assignment of the tenancies. My Lady is quite right. The case that decided that an assignment could be ordered as a Property Adjustment Order was Thomson and Thompson endorsed by the Court of Appeal, subsequently in a case called Hale and Hale, which"
02:56:44.800,02:56:46.400,spk_1,"There are a lot of us about."
02:56:46.700,02:58:05.400,spk_5,"That case singularly important for those of us who work in housing because it showed that a secure tenancy was property for the purposes of Sections 23 and 24 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. It produces a situation for a spouse where she or he has two ways of getting their hands on a secure tenancy. One is by vesting, which would be achieved under what was the Matrimonial Homes Act now the Family Law Act, or alternatively, by assignment, which is what you get If you proceed under the 1973 Act. My Lords, My Lady, I have about four more minutes. If I may, I'll continue just shortly, I was addressing the court on issue two and suggesting that my learned friend had to show that the statutory scheme envisaged a loss. A shut off of the available is Section 85 on death, he says. That's inherent from the scheme with respect to him. My answers to that proposition are as follows firstly, that this is a scheme which contemplates and expressly deals with death. Sections 87 to 89, Section 90 and the Right to Buy provisions. All deal with death."
02:58:06.600,02:58:07.000,spk_1,"If"
02:58:07.000,02:58:33.000,spk_5,"death had therefore been a cut off for Section 85 it's astonishing that the Act doesn't say so. Secondly, Section 85 requires the making of no application. It doesn't say you can't apply once you're dead because you don't need to apply at all. Section 85 is simply a descriptor of the discretions in either"
02:58:33.000,02:58:36.400,spk_2,"one. Thirdly,"
02:58:36.400,02:58:40.300,spk_5,"as I've already indicated, we have Section 85(5) expressly building in"
02:58:40.300,02:58:41.300,spk_3,"a provision which is likely"
02:58:41.300,02:58:42.500,spk_5,"to be very useful"
02:58:42.800,02:58:43.800,spk_1,"where"
02:58:43.800,03:00:48.500,spk_5,"a former secure tenant has died. Fourthly, Section 85 includes an express limiter that it's not available once the order has been executed. On reflection in the course of argument, it has become clear the way that my Lady and my Lord, Lord Walker in particular, from putting questions to myself and my learned friend that a more appropriate way, perhaps of advancing and understanding the Appellant's case is to simply put it in this way that the respondent has not shown why the statutory discretion cannot be invoked after the former tenant has died. The respondent has not shown why the statutory discretion cannot be invoked after the former tenant has died. That strips out the as my Lord, Lord Walker has described inappropriate in context issues about estates, Personal Representatives and so on and so forth. It simply it puts very simply, Section 85 is available unless the statute expressly or impliedly indicates that it's not. And there is no such express or implied indication. Finally, can I deal with two points raised by my Lord, Lord Browne relation to this point? First of all, Lord Browne put to me yesterday that it was not unknown for some causes of action not to pass on death, and my Lord was absolutely right and gave me the example of Defamation cases with respect would remind my Lord that that is because Defamation is expressly excepted from passing as a cause of action by Section 1 of the 1934 Act, which is in the appendix at Page 81. All other causes of action will pass. The second point is a point, my Lord, Lord Browne put to my learned friend this morning, and that is as two advantages and dis-benefits. If we're right on issue"
03:00:48.500,03:00:49.800,spk_3,"two. And"
03:00:49.800,03:01:15.000,spk_5,"if I may respectfully say so, my learned friend was absolutely candid in this regard. It's very difficult to identify any disbenefits that is for landlords or tenants. The advantages are obvious, and they include in the instant case, the person that statute intended should succeed a secure tenant, namely his brother, may be unable to do so."
03:01:28.000,03:01:28.400,spk_6,"Well,"
03:01:28.400,03:01:44.400,spk_2,"thank you very much indeed. We're extremely grateful to counsel for their assistance both orally and in writing and also for sitting at 10 o'clock today so that we're able to finish at such a convenient time. We will take time to consider our decision, which will be issued in due"
03:01:44.400,03:01:44.900,spk_3,"course."
