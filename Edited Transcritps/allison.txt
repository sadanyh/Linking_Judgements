p1,00:00:43.450,00:00:45.020,spk_1,Hearing of Alison v Her Majesty's.
p1,00:00:45.030,00:00:45.580,spk_2,Advocate.
p1,00:00:46.290,00:00:46.730,spk_3,[Background noise].
p1,00:00:54.350,00:01:37.610,spk_2,"Mr. Jackson, we're proposing to hear Allison first. I hope that's convenient to everybody. And what we'll do is we'll hear the entire argument in Allison. And then that having been completed, we'll pass onto McInnis. And I suggested that council who are in Allison's case should be in the front row and for obvious reasons, McInnis in the row behind. Yes, it seems to be a very large measure of agreement between you and the Lord Advocate."
p1,00:01:40.650,00:01:43.270,spk_4,[Inaudible] almost no disagreement at all.
p1,00:01:44.360,00:02:23.370,spk_2,"Well, there are two basic points I would have thought the first was whether there was a failure to disclose material which should have been disclosed. And that's accepted that the outstanding charges should have been disclosed. And I think it's accepted that the court below went too far in just dismissing the outstanding charges is something which could not possibly have any importance. And then there's a question whether the devolution issue and that's accepted, Mr. Prentice, I think, isn't it? So there we are and the question really is disposal, isn't it? And that's what we do next. I mean what I do next is turn over four pages [inaudible] [laughing]."
p1,00:02:27.200,00:02:41.960,spk_3,"I mean, I know it's really largely, How would you exactly? I think there is some question as to exactly what the relevance of outstanding charges are on how one would put the test."
p1,00:02:41.970,00:02:52.720,spk_4,I would not put the test any differently than My Lord Roger has outlined in the case of McDonald.
p1,00:02:53.520,00:02:55.820,spk_2,Should we look at the case then just to see exactly what the proposition is.
p1,00:02:55.820,00:03:04.350,spk_4,"Because that in my submission sums it up, if I may say so fairly well. And that is a tab 10 and the volume of authorities and"
p1,00:03:04.360,00:03:05.150,spk_5,paragraph 50.
p1,00:03:08.420,00:03:15.190,spk_2,Is this a joint volume? A single volume?
p1,00:03:15.200,00:03:17.300,spk_4,"Yes, just a single volume of authorities."
p1,00:03:17.310,00:03:17.950,spk_2,Yes.
p1,00:03:19.440,00:03:19.820,spk_6,[Background noise].
p1,00:03:28.010,00:03:28.510,spk_0,Paragraph --
p1,00:03:28.510,00:03:29.380,spk_2,what did you say? 50?
p1,00:03:29.390,00:03:30.900,spk_4,"50, five zero."
p1,00:03:36.030,00:03:36.650,spk_3,Yeah.
p1,00:03:41.350,00:03:54.310,spk_4,"And reading just at the top of the page into paragraph 50. As the appeal court pointed out in the present case, and these decisions, the judges use slightly different expressions"
p1,00:03:54.380,00:03:54.710,spk_6,to
p1,00:03:54.710,00:03:58.230,spk_4,describe the nature of the material that has to be disclosed.
p1,00:03:59.110,00:03:59.360,spk_2,I
p1,00:03:59.370,00:04:18.660,spk_4,do not regard those verbal variations as being of any significance. I would respectfully agree with that I tried to list all the ways that the test has been described. Sometimes it's a risk of real prejudice. It's described in a host of ways but I would agree with the statement that these
p1,00:04:18.670,00:04:19.829,spk_2,different
p1,00:04:19.829,00:04:28.900,spk_4,ways of putting it all come to the same thing. And My Lord goes on to say all the expressions are designed to describe the same obligation.
p1,00:04:29.880,00:04:30.110,spk_2,The
p1,00:04:30.110,00:04:43.470,spk_4,"Golden Rule Court described by Lord Bingham of Cornhill and R v H and C, has the advantage of encapsulating both the positive, negative, possible negative effects of material on the crown's case."
p1,00:04:43.760,00:04:44.120,spk_0,And it's
p1,00:04:44.120,00:04:47.020,spk_4,possible positive effect on the defence case.
p1,00:04:47.910,00:04:48.440,spk_5,Put
p1,00:04:48.440,00:05:05.930,spk_4,"shortly, the crown must disclose any statement or other material of which they are aware and which either materially weakens the crown case or materially strengthens the defence case. Now, with respect, I can't find a better way of putting it."
p1,00:05:06.250,00:05:24.450,spk_3,"It's nice of you to say so, Mr Jackson, but really getting slightly different. What supposed you've got this material? The outstanding charge. What can you do? What exactly can you do? Because I think that's raised a little bit."
p1,00:05:25.360,00:05:32.990,spk_4,I'm not sure what My Lord means by what could I do with it? I can certainly answer why I think it was important.
p1,00:05:33.680,00:05:35.150,spk_3,That's probably the same points.
p1,00:05:35.160,00:06:06.690,spk_4,"The reason I was distinguishing there is the question is raised as to how one deals with it. But I take the view that there is no direct case this has happened. If you're dealing with, as it were, a dead witness, then you couldn't put the previous convictions to that witness. But nevertheless, it would be relevant to bring them out in certain circumstances. So you would just by some other method an extract conviction or whatever you would place before the jury that he had those convictions."
p1,00:06:06.700,00:06:19.610,spk_2,What would the relevance be? The court put it in paragraph 20 judgement we have in the bundle of volumes.
p1,00:06:19.610,00:06:20.230,spk_4,I understand.
p1,00:06:22.080,00:06:39.310,spk_2,Thank you. Lord Osborne I think he's making a point that individuals charged with a crime are innocent until proven guilty we can't assume from the fact that there are outstanding charges that he was guilty.
p1,00:06:39.310,00:06:46.520,spk_4,"That, I suppose, is their argument for saying that outstanding charges are not material which should be disclosed."
p1,00:06:47.450,00:06:48.010,spk_2,But
p1,00:06:48.010,00:07:01.280,spk_4,"we have, I think, got past that in that this court has decided in a number of cases, and that's what we're in agreement on. And that's where My Lord began with me that outstanding cases should be disclosed."
p1,00:07:02.140,00:07:05.490,spk_3,"Yes, but the point remains exactly what do you do with them?"
p1,00:07:05.800,00:07:06.550,spk_4,What value would they have?
p1,00:07:06.740,00:07:08.990,spk_3,"Yes, that's I think what's My Lord was asking."
p1,00:07:09.020,00:07:31.090,spk_4,"I would answer that by that needs to be applied to the facts and circumstances of a particular case. One can imagine various ways in which they might matter. For example, they could provide a motive for someone cooperating with the police. That would not be an uncommon situation"
p1,00:07:32.790,00:07:33.320,spk_2,where
p1,00:07:33.320,00:07:42.660,spk_4,"someone with outstanding charges is of the view that if they cooperate with the police or as it were, gives someone else"
p1,00:07:42.670,00:07:43.430,spk_3,"up,"
p1,00:07:44.110,00:08:02.000,spk_4,"then it might go in their favour at some later proceedings. It also can simply go to the question as to whether or not this is a person that one can properly and easy rely on as a truthful, credible"
p1,00:08:02.000,00:08:02.800,spk_2,witness.
p1,00:08:04.490,00:08:25.830,spk_4,"So to use the old cliche, it goes to credibility. In general terms, it goes to credibility, but in more particular terms. In some cases, it might be demonstrating the motive. So the question as to whether or not it matters has to be looked at doesn't matter in that particular case."
p1,00:08:26.430,00:08:27.430,spk_3,"I mean,"
p1,00:08:27.440,00:08:29.060,spk_4,And that's always the difficulty.
p1,00:08:29.070,00:08:49.010,spk_3,"Yeah, I mean, if one we're dealing with someone just in a private capacity, one's attitude to him or her might change. If one knew that there was an outstanding charge of fraud against him or her even if it hadn't been yet approved taking into account,"
p1,00:08:49.020,00:08:53.910,spk_4,"You wouldn't still buy the used car, even although they were innocent technically of the crime."
p1,00:08:54.000,00:08:56.090,spk_3,You would certainly think twice. You
p1,00:08:56.090,00:09:13.680,spk_4,"would certainly do that. And the only real difference, I think if I've got this right between myself and Advocate Depute in this case is how it mattered in the present case. Because we both say that it should have been disclosed."
p1,00:09:13.690,00:09:14.310,spk_2,We're
p1,00:09:14.310,00:09:42.440,spk_4,"both content with the test, which I mentioned in paragraph 50 of McDonald, which is repeated, I think, by both My Lord, Roger and My Lord in the chair in the case of Marta, no one is in this argument. At least I can't speak for other cases. But no one in this argument is disputing the test, and therefore the only matter which is between us is whether or not in the circumstances of this case, it would have mattered."
p1,00:09:43.640,00:09:52.660,spk_2,There is a helpful discussion in the case for the respondent in paragraph 14. We don't know whether you agree with the
p1,00:09:52.670,00:09:54.200,spk_5,way
p1,00:09:54.810,00:10:04.300,spk_2,"this works, is there. This is where we have our 14. That's the respondents case. He says the crown doesn't resist"
p1,00:10:04.340,00:10:04.610,spk_5,the
p1,00:10:04.620,00:10:18.890,spk_2,"proposition that outstanding charge Crown witness might be capable of materially weakening the Crown case. And the example is, if the witness and this is assuming a live of course now, is denying he's ever been in trouble with the police."
p1,00:10:20.480,00:10:21.010,spk_3,Absolutely.
p1,00:10:22.470,00:10:25.280,spk_2,That one could see that that would be relevant.
p1,00:10:28.465,00:10:45.195,spk_4,"Which is why I say that one has to start with, it is disclosable. The test is what in a shorthand as a materiality test. And then you simply have to apply it to the particular case because it could be a huge variety of ways it could apply to different cases"
p1,00:10:47.865,00:11:00.760,spk_2,"mentioned, but also the idea that the witness might have a personal animus against somebody because charge with some details as to what the charge was. Yeah, based"
p1,00:11:00.770,00:11:01.120,spk_4,on
p1,00:11:01.780,00:11:02.420,spk_2,allegations by somebody.
p1,00:11:02.870,00:11:32.960,spk_4,"Without being anecdotal, there is a case due to come back to the appeal court in Scotland and precisely that point. Where a key witness it has now been discovered had an outstanding charge, and the witness against him in the outstanding charge is the person who gave evidence against in the trial. Now that case is in the pipeline to come back as a reference from the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission. So it gives a perfect example, if I may say so of that happening."
p1,00:11:33.410,00:11:40.140,spk_3,"In Holland, there was, there was they were the outstanding charge related to drug dealing from the very premises, which were involved."
p1,00:11:41.200,00:12:07.610,spk_4,"But one just to see how it matters, one has to see how it matters in a particular case, one simply has to take materiality test and then say, as a matter of judgement, because in the end of the day, these things are always a matter of judgement. How does it apply to the particular case? And I say in this case, because this is the only area with disagreement on. So I moved to that that in this case it does matter."
p1,00:12:08.490,00:12:43.520,spk_0,"Mr Jackson, I mean, in a way, if it's already agreed this these outstanding charges fell within Lord Hope's definition of what was disclosable in McDonald in the past has almost been so isn't it? Because the obligation is to disclose these sort of things if they do materially weaken the Crown's case or material strength of the defence case and if they do either of those things almost by definition, if it's material."
p1,00:12:44.640,00:12:45.210,spk_3,That's right.
p1,00:12:45.390,00:12:52.710,spk_0,"But I mean, that's not quite what's agreed here. What's agreed here is that they might be capable of materially weakening the Crown's case."
p1,00:12:52.720,00:12:59.190,spk_4,"Yes, that's where we are in disagreement. If we were in agreement on the final point, there would be nothing to argue."
p1,00:12:59.200,00:13:12.460,spk_0,"But I'm just, I'm just suggesting that therefore the you actually have to. I mean, the question is whether they should have been disclosed, not whether their disclosure remained a difference strictly."
p1,00:13:12.930,00:13:13.670,spk_4,"Well,"
p1,00:13:14.010,00:13:21.940,spk_0,"I mean, I think I thought we agreed in the later case of Murdock that actually just to be on the safe side, you disclose these things anyway,"
p1,00:13:21.950,00:13:27.400,spk_4,I don't think the cloning and disagreement with that I think we are in agreement they should have been disclosed.
p1,00:13:27.410,00:13:32.790,spk_0,"But not because they met that test, because the test goes too far. If"
p1,00:13:32.790,00:13:36.370,spk_3,"that's what. You should really, which may either materially weaken -- exactly."
p1,00:13:36.370,00:13:37.230,spk_0,Exactly. I
p1,00:13:37.230,00:13:43.280,spk_3,"mean, that would be the best, that would refine it. Yes. I think that that would be preferable for the reason Lord Browne says."
p1,00:13:43.290,00:14:14.840,spk_4,"But what I think. I don't want to speak for the Advocate Depute and what the crown, I think are saying in this case that is all curable at this stage in the sense that when you look at it, you would say, well, it's not material in the same way as rightly or wrongly, the appeal court in Scotland cure, if i may use that word, the lack of disclosure of the previous convictions. The crown are inviting you to do the same with the outstanding cases and say, in lay terms, it didn't matter all that much."
p1,00:14:14.850,00:14:19.360,spk_2,"In the way it's put, and I'm sorry to keep referring to Mr Prentice's case, but it's a useful,"
p1,00:14:19.990,00:14:20.840,spk_4,I intend to do that.
p1,00:14:20.850,00:14:25.080,spk_2,"He intends to use page 12 in his case, he's saying"
p1,00:14:25.080,00:14:26.230,spk_5,that
p1,00:14:26.780,00:14:39.400,spk_2,the outstanding charges could not have been deployed and no unfairness was caused. And he's got seven points that he makes in order to reach that conclusion
p1,00:14:40.090,00:14:40.790,spk_4,and what I had --
p1,00:14:40.790,00:14:41.760,spk_2,that's an issue between them.
p1,00:14:41.960,00:14:54.240,spk_4,"What I had intended to do in presenting to this court. Why it does matter was, in fact, to use the Advocate Depute's seven reasons as to why it didn't matter and to answer each and every one of them."
p1,00:14:55.630,00:14:56.490,spk_2,Should we proceed then?
p1,00:14:56.500,00:15:14.420,spk_4,"That, I think, is the only matter in dispute answering those seven points. The Advocate Depute says first of all, it was part of a circumstantial case against the appellant and was not of such significance as to be decisive."
p1,00:15:14.850,00:15:24.890,spk_3,"I would just say, my mind, we're what, we're considering is what additional would come from disclosing the outstanding charge?"
p1,00:15:24.890,00:15:25.750,spk_4,Why it would have mattered?
p1,00:15:25.750,00:15:37.220,spk_3,"Why that, given that we have to assume that it wouldn't, it didn't make enough difference that they hadn't disclosed the previous conviction."
p1,00:15:37.310,00:15:39.600,spk_4,"Well, I'm stuck with that."
p1,00:15:40.020,00:15:40.640,spk_3,You
p1,00:15:40.650,00:15:51.330,spk_4,"might not agree with it and I will have to deal with that. That's one of the seven points, but I expect I accept to a degree, I stuck with"
p1,00:15:51.460,00:15:57.520,spk_0,"it. I mean, why? Why? Why aren't you suggesting that, really what we should be considering is the"
p1,00:15:57.520,00:16:05.620,spk_4,"cumulative failure. Well, My Lord, I mean, is ahead of me. That is what I would have said. It is the cumulative, what I meant I am stuck with. I'm"
p1,00:16:05.620,00:16:13.410,spk_0,"not suggesting, incidentally, don't get too optimistic, but I'm trying to see how you could be putting it."
p1,00:16:13.420,00:16:23.870,spk_4,"I, the accumulative point was the point I was going to meet when I said I was stuck with it. I mean, I'm stuck with what they did. But my answer to it, if"
p1,00:16:23.870,00:16:24.470,spk_3,you add this then it tips it over.
p1,00:16:24.480,00:16:45.120,spk_4,"Absolutely. It is what I will call, but I'm jumping ahead the tipping point. But they say that they're going to be answered in the number of ways he says. First of all, it was part of a circumstantial case and was not of such significance as could be decisive. Well, I would say that in a sense is"
p1,00:16:45.870,00:16:46.740,spk_2,true.
p1,00:16:46.750,00:17:12.209,spk_4,"In a sense, in a sense, in that it was a circumstantial case and that circumstantial case I don't intend to go through in detail but is laid out in a number of places in the volume. In particular, you would find it in the judgment in Allison in tab 10 and paragraph 16. It's also in the judge's report, which is a tab 4."
p1,00:17:16.480,00:17:23.209,spk_2,You've got the right. It's not. I'm sorry. There are two paragraphs 16 in the judges -- I'm
p1,00:17:23.209,00:17:23.620,spk_4,sorry [inaudible]
p1,00:17:25.480,00:17:30.360,spk_2,"paragraph 6(1) headed under the heading of the decision. Oh,"
p1,00:17:30.370,00:17:37.980,spk_0,"two where's the other. There are, there are two 16's and 17's and 18's."
p1,00:17:37.990,00:17:42.240,spk_2,Wait
p1,00:17:42.360,00:17:44.020,spk_0,a second. Wait
p1,00:17:44.030,00:17:47.650,spk_4,"16 where the word's, the decision, appear before the paragraph number."
p1,00:17:47.660,00:17:54.060,spk_2,It is my mistake. 16 is a quotation from Lord Hamilton.
p1,00:17:54.210,00:17:56.970,spk_3,Supplementary report Lord Bracket is at tab 8.
p1,00:17:56.980,00:18:03.380,spk_4,"Yes, that way it's laid out"
p1,00:18:03.380,00:18:04.310,spk_0,in a number of different
p1,00:18:04.310,00:18:08.440,spk_4,places. I'm content to say that that is the better place to do it from.
p1,00:18:11.140,00:18:16.500,spk_3,Thank you. It gives a great deal. It's actually it's tab 8.
p1,00:18:17.030,00:18:19.250,spk_4,And its in the third report.
p1,00:18:19.520,00:18:24.970,spk_3,One which goes into the detail. One thats got all the writing on it.
p1,00:18:24.980,00:18:29.560,spk_4,But that is the circumstantial case. But can I without going through in
p1,00:18:29.560,00:18:31.160,spk_2,"detail, just"
p1,00:18:31.160,00:18:34.550,spk_4,say one or two things about that to make the point I want to make?
p1,00:18:38.800,00:18:43.090,spk_3,Towards the back. Towards the back.

p1,00:19:19.530,00:19:21.670,spk_4,But about the circumstantial case.
p1,00:19:22.830,00:19:23.450,spk_5,What
p1,00:19:23.450,00:20:03.410,spk_4,"I would say is this and this in is my submission, the important point, the evidence that Stronach gave via his statement evidence which came from, as it were, the dead Stronach was of a different character than all the other pieces of circumstantial evidence. It was not just a piece of circumstantial evidence like any other. By that, I mean, it was the only piece of circumstantial evidence that directly linked the accused Allison to a drug transaction."
p1,00:20:06.540,00:20:08.220,spk_3,It was the only piece of direct evidence?
p1,00:20:08.230,00:20:30.070,spk_4,"It was directly linked to a drugs transaction. Everything else linked him to people who were involved in the drug business. It was every other piece of circumstantial evidence involved him with meeting people, people. It was his evidence of association with people who in turn, were involved in the drug business"
p1,00:20:30.910,00:20:32.330,spk_2,to the bottom of page 3 of the report.
p1,00:20:33.210,00:20:34.340,spk_4,"Indeed,"
p1,00:20:34.350,00:20:35.370,spk_2,it mentions him by name. Indeed.
p1,00:20:35.560,00:20:36.560,spk_0,"Indeed,"
p1,00:20:36.570,00:20:38.470,spk_5,but
p1,00:20:38.500,00:20:39.570,spk_4,what Stronach was
p1,00:20:39.570,00:20:40.240,spk_2,saying
p1,00:20:40.780,00:21:04.020,spk_4,"was that on the day he had driven a car to Ayeshire and had been stopped with £30,000 worth of illegal drugs in his car. He was on that day driving on the instruction of a man whom the jury could infer was Mr Allison. So it was not a piece of evidence like any other."
p1,00:21:06.130,00:21:06.480,spk_3,It
p1,00:21:06.480,00:22:58.940,spk_4,"had a particular significance. Although this is not in the documents you have, it is not without note, because I checked it just recently that in dealing with this in his speech to the jury, the Advocate Depute described that piece of evidence as being significant. In that sense, he did give it some prominence because he speaks about and I quote, Mr Stronach said, that it was Stevie who asked him to take the car down to Kilmarnock. Now, if that is true, that is clearly a quite, significant piece of evidence because it would closely associate Stephen Alison with a specific vehicle on a specific day. A specific vehicle that you know, was found later that same specific day to contain a substantial quantity of cocaine. So the Advocate Depute was, to some degree and quite properly majoring on the fact that that linked him directly to a drug transaction. Everything else is just association with people who are in the drug business. So when the Advocate Depute says it is part of a circumstantial case, he's right. When he says it was not of such significance as to be decisive. If he means by that, was there a sufficiency of evidence without it? Then he may be right, but it should not be thought it was just a piece of circumstantial evidence like any other. It was a highly significant piece of circumstantial evidence because it was, as I repeat, the only direct link to a drug transaction. And therefore was that the jewel, as it were in that particular case."
p1,00:22:59.660,00:23:10.460,spk_2,"The Appeal Court at page 14, the bottom of the page we consider"
p1,00:23:10.460,00:23:11.490,spk_0,that a corroborated
p1,00:23:11.500,00:23:14.860,spk_2,case existed against the appellant without the necessity of taking into account the evidence given by Mr Stronach?
p1,00:23:18.520,00:23:52.750,spk_4,"I have just conceded that. I've not said it was decisive in the sense it was crucial. I'm not saying it was crucial for sufficiency. Therefore, when the Advocate Depute says it was not of such significance to be decisive, if he means it wasn't necessary for sufficiency, then I give him that. But what I say is it was It is wrong to jump from that to say it was just a circumstantial piece of evidence like any other. It was not. It was far more significant than any other piece of evidence."
p1,00:23:54.830,00:23:55.480,spk_2,
p1,00:23:59.530,00:24:33.050,spk_4,"The second matter the Advocate Depute made, if I go through this quickly, is that the witness did not give evidence before the court. I'm not quite sure how that helps him, because that I would have suggested to this court makes matters worse because a witness who does not give evidence having material with which to discredit him is even more critical because your normal methods of undermining the witness are not present."
p1,00:24:35.240,00:24:39.270,spk_3,"I mean, here, the witness was undermined. Yes,"
p1,00:24:39.270,00:24:47.700,spk_4,I come to that. I do come to that. But I'm simply dealing with the issues that are raised. And the second one is he wasn't giving evidence. Now
p1,00:24:48.020,00:25:08.590,spk_2,"it's true. The point he is getting out, I think, is that it wasn't possible to put details to him and therefore one of the uses to which one would put the outstanding charges.Yes, yes. Isn't available. For example excepting that he was in trouble with the police."
p1,00:25:08.600,00:25:14.560,spk_4,That's right. But the point I would make the the converse of
p1,00:25:14.560,00:25:16.650,spk_5,that is that
p1,00:25:16.660,00:25:24.670,spk_4,a witness by a Section 259 notice is for the defence counsel extremely difficult altogether
p1,00:25:24.680,00:25:25.640,spk_2,because
p1,00:25:25.640,00:25:53.600,spk_4,"it's almost undealable with because there's no one there under oath, there is no cross examination. There is no assessing the demeanour of the witnesses and the witness box. He may or may not have looked like a shifty character to use a phrase, but we will never know that. So any ammunition you have to discredit him becomes all the more critical when you can't use your normal tools to discredit"
p1,00:25:55.020,00:25:57.960,spk_2,for the avoidance of doubt allows the court.
p1,00:25:58.120,00:26:12.560,spk_4,"That's the method by which his evidence was led. I'm sorry, I'm sorry in My Lord's that's the procedure under the Scottish legislation that allows evidence of a witness to be led without the witness being present."
p1,00:26:12.570,00:26:15.460,spk_2,Is a trial judge expected to give directions to the jury about the care that is to be taken?
p1,00:26:19.410,00:26:21.510,spk_3,I
p1,00:26:21.520,00:26:43.420,spk_4,"think the point out, as he pointed out in this case, that he was not cross examined. He was not on oath to say those things. They don't give the equivalent of what I call an [inaudible] warning, but they don't I think, tell that the jury specifically they must treat the evidence with care. But they would tend to point out the limitations that is. But he's always evidence given, like that is always"
p1,00:26:43.870,00:26:54.220,spk_3,"does say, he says, you're going to have to exercise great care. And he says that in his charge bottom of page 23 top of page 24."
p1,00:26:54.230,00:26:57.480,spk_4,"I understood, My Lord in the chair to have asked me was it a sort of"
p1,00:26:57.480,00:26:58.810,spk_5,set in
p1,00:26:58.810,00:27:04.170,spk_4,"stone legal ruling that had to say that I'm not aware of that, although I accept he said it very much in that case."
p1,00:27:05.100,00:27:16.120,spk_0,"But I mean, had you known everything. Are you in a position to say I mean you might have been able to object to his evidence being allowed in under section 259. Having regard to all this"
p1,00:27:17.890,00:27:48.720,spk_4,"the difficulty. I would like to say that I could, but I don't think I could have, because the law's pretty much settled that if he is dead, it is allowed in. It is a matter of assessment later on in the trace as to what can be made of it. It is very, very difficult to stop evidence being led under Section 259 if the witness is dead. Perhaps should be easier, but I have to say it's not, it's not at all easy, so I don't think that stopping the evidence would have been possible. My complaint"
p1,00:27:48.720,00:27:50.180,spk_0,"is, I mean, we've"
p1,00:27:50.180,00:27:51.090,spk_5,had
p1,00:27:51.100,00:27:52.750,spk_0,on this side of the border.
p1,00:27:52.930,00:27:53.950,spk_6,We're
p1,00:27:53.950,00:27:59.760,spk_0,"giving judgment in a case. Is it tomorrow called [inaudible], which deals with a whole host of Strasbourg?"

p1,00:28:00.790,00:28:14.140,spk_0,"anybody not? Absolutely. And there's a case called Al Quadra, and I mean Strasbourg put huge question marks over the use of dead witnesses and so forth. I mean, that's in the context, with the solar and decisive"
p1,00:28:14.150,00:28:14.980,spk_5,evidence.
p1,00:28:15.910,00:28:26.490,spk_0,"That is, that is true that is true. But, I mean, I think our own domestic legislation has built in safeguards. I don't know,"
p1,00:28:26.500,00:28:36.430,spk_4,"but the point being made about solar and decisive evidence would apply, as I understand that north of the broader where it is decisive, then we're into a different,"
p1,00:28:36.440,00:28:37.140,spk_2,
p1,00:28:37.150,00:28:45.910,spk_4,"into a different part. But in this situation, do I think had I had this extra ammunition, I could have stopped it being led. No, I don't. I absolutely"
p1,00:28:46.050,00:28:47.490,spk_0,think that
p1,00:28:47.490,00:28:50.400,spk_4,would not have been something I would have tried or succeeded
p1,00:28:50.400,00:28:50.930,spk_2,in.
p1,00:29:01.260,00:29:36.410,spk_4,"And I suspect, perhaps generally speaking to do, I'm not entirely sure of that, but I think probably to do. But my point remains that the fact he is not giving evidence is a point, as it were in my favour, because I don't have the normal tools to deal with him. So anything I can have to discredit him becomes evolving more value because I can't use his demeanour. I can't cross examine him. I can't do any of those things. So having the discrediting tools is even more important with the witness led under 259 because"
p1,00:29:36.410,00:29:37.970,spk_5,"of,"
p1,00:29:37.980,00:30:11.240,spk_4,"the fact that he is not presently. It's the same, of course, and some force in this and I think this is the point Lord Roger was making to me. It is accepted by all parties that Mr Stronach was a liar and told many lies in his interview. And that is true. Clearly, the Crown case depended on him telling lies because, for example, in his statement, he said, Mr Allison told me to take the car, but he did, said he told me to take it for a different reason. The Crown wanted part of that and not part of it."
p1,00:30:11.250,00:30:12.450,spk_3,He said he was going to sell it?
p1,00:30:12.450,00:31:22.160,spk_4,"To sell it, and indeed, in his speech to the jury is very much said. But I say that doesn't matter. The question is not whether he was a liar. The question is whether one could reliably believe anything this man said, and in the end of the day, the Crown are saying yes, this person does not always tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. But it remains the position that this very significant part of the crown case and I go back to the fact it was significant depended on that part of it and asking a jury to accept the man being truthful on that matter. And the question is not whether or not he was a liar. In some ways, the question is whether or not he should have been believed in anything, whether he was a man, that anyone could place any credence on or any reliability on the Crown in my submission can't get away from that by saying, Well, we said he was not entirely truthful. I was gonna say in almost every case, in lots of cases, well, the Crown can find something to criticise their own witness. That's not the issue. The issue is whether he can believed at all."
p1,00:31:22.210,00:31:32.860,spk_2,"Point 3, i don't know whether you finished point 2. Point 3 is accepted by all parties. That's"
p1,00:31:32.860,00:31:34.560,spk_4,"what I'm trying to answer, point 3."
p1,00:31:34.670,00:31:50.880,spk_2,"and what we have the material for. The outstanding charges, which has not been proved against him, of course, are two charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act. One charge of death by housebreaking and a number of road traffic"
p1,00:31:51.450,00:32:01.390,spk_4,I can come to that if i may My Lords. But that's right. But the fourth matter there is because that comes in 2.5 I think the fourth matter the crown
p1,00:32:01.390,00:32:02.320,spk_2,raised
p1,00:32:02.620,00:32:05.310,spk_4,is that the only evidence they relied
p1,00:32:05.310,00:32:05.890,spk_2,on
p1,00:32:06.820,00:32:30.310,spk_4,"that is the piece about the instruction to take the car to Ayeshire was supported by independent evidence. No, I don't accept that. I simply do not accept that the independent evidence was that car being seen in the driveway of the appellant earlier the same day."
p1,00:32:31.080,00:32:31.400,spk_5,Now
p1,00:32:31.400,00:33:15.970,spk_4,"that is only as it were independent evidence to support what one knew anyway that there was evidence of association with people. The key part of Mr Stronach's evidence is the instruction he was given that Allison gave him to drive it. The car and the driveway earlier doesn't help in that at all. It only adds to the general level of association. I'm sure the crown prayed at an aide in the sense of it was part of the picture of association. But what they were really relying on in Stronach's evidence was Stronach says Allison, or the man who could be inferred to be Allison told me to drive the car to Ayeshire."
p1,00:33:17.690,00:33:18.850,spk_3,"I mean,"
p1,00:33:18.860,00:33:25.870,spk_4,"that's not supported, that key issue, which is a significant part of the Advocate Depute's significance."
p1,00:33:26.660,00:33:27.210,spk_5,That's
p1,00:33:27.210,00:33:29.180,spk_4,not supported by independent evidence at all.
p1,00:33:30.020,00:33:43.900,spk_3,"I mean, obviously, I mean, I said it, but I mean, the fact that it was in the car was in the driveway at morning, and drugs are found in it later that day. I mean, it's part of the circumstantial picture."
p1,00:33:43.900,00:34:09.290,spk_4,"Of course. I don't say it is not of value, but I don't say it is a much value in it supports that. It supports the fact that Mr Allison associated with these people, it doesn't, the key part, what is really significant in Stronach's evidence by 259 is that we gave him the instruction to go there. That's what links us to drug transaction. The independent evidence doesn't help with that."
p1,00:34:10.190,00:34:11.810,spk_0,Does it speak to an association
p1,00:34:11.810,00:34:29.159,spk_4,"with the car? Yes, of course. But, if I'm associated with a person who has a car, I may well, also be, it doesn't. It doesn't change the the problem the Crown have of adding to giving instruction to go there."
p1,00:34:30.190,00:34:31.129,spk_3,Well the significance
p1,00:34:31.129,00:34:32.690,spk_0,of Stronach's evidence
p1,00:34:33.179,00:34:33.340,spk_6,and
p1,00:34:33.340,00:34:34.520,spk_5,the part of his evidence
p1,00:34:34.520,00:34:35.820,spk_2,that the crown
p1,00:34:35.820,00:34:36.950,spk_5,wish to rely

p1,00:34:39.290,00:34:40.139,spk_0,the association
p1,00:34:40.139,00:34:40.990,spk_5,with the cars. Isn't that
p1,00:34:40.990,00:34:41.490,spk_2,right?
p1,00:34:42.260,00:35:05.760,spk_4,Not quite. Association the crucial part of that so called association. What takes up to the next notch is that we were instructing him to make the journey with the car in a drug transaction that's more than association. That's what links us directly into the drug transaction and takes it up a
p1,00:35:05.760,00:35:06.520,spk_5,notch.
p1,00:35:08.130,00:35:08.880,spk_3,

p1,00:35:13.680,00:36:22.120,spk_4,"next point which has made it is the point already mentioned that the high court has already considered the previous convictions and said that didn't matter. And that's what I was grateful to My Lord, because that's where I was going to say my answer to that was the answer I've already been given that it is a cumulative thing and you cannot look at it. The failure to disclose the outstanding cases in the vacuum. It is going back to looking at the whole picture. Now that is not revisiting because I can't ask you to do that. I may not have liked it, but I can't ask you to revisit the high court's view of the previous convictions. But this court is now looking at the totality of it, the cumulative effect and as I've already hinted, who knows what the tipping point is? Who knows. All I know is that the defence did not have all the ammunition. Now who knows how many bullets it would have been necessary to fire to get the desired result. All I know is that one of those bullets was not in the defendants"

p1,00:36:59.140,00:36:59.490,spk_6,the witness. But it is for you to show that it does tip the balance?
p1,00:37:07.290,00:37:17.240,spk_4,One can never be absolutely sure it tips the balance. One can get the jury back in and ask them what they would have done. So I can absolutely show it tips the
p1,00:37:17.240,00:37:18.800,spk_5,balance. But
p1,00:37:18.800,00:37:43.050,spk_4,"what I can do is say, in terms of the test which has been outlined of materiality in a witness that I can't cross examine. And in a witness whose evidence by 259 is, I come back again and again, the most significant piece of evidence. It's not a circumstantial piece like any other, then not to have that is material. In terms of undermining the Crown case."
p1,00:37:43.060,00:38:11.190,spk_3,"I accept one sense. It's a disadvantage not able to cross examine. And, of course, in another sense, you don't, he can't answer back either. You just have to take it. Mr. Watson was in a position to reveal all these lies and so on, and there was no, there was no come back to witness the danger. I don't need to tell you the danger, of course, is the witnesses response."
p1,00:38:11.200,00:38:16.360,spk_4,"I take my Lords point, but perhaps it's the arrogance of counsel. I would sooner have the chance at cross examining."

p1,00:38:28.390,00:38:32.090,spk_4,6 is the same. I think it's Point 6 is they would not have added

p1,00:38:32.930,00:38:35.450,spk_4,"and I think that's really the same answer, which I'm"

I don't accept that. For this reason, it was never going to be in dispute. In the real world of the case, he was associated with people like that. So leading evidence that someone he associated with had a drug conviction was not that harmful because that was passed praying for. What was necessary was to say to the jury, you can't rely on this man, so I don't see how bringing out he would have had a previous conviction. A man, he would have been linked to a man who had outstanding charges for drugs matters would have been of terrible importance because the crown were proving that umpteen times"

p1,00:40:26.140,00:40:31.300,spk_2,have to say about that? He's already been convicted three times for crimes of dishonesty.

p1,00:40:33.800,00:41:28.920,spk_4,"I can only come back to the point I've made about the tipping point. That's the only way I can answer that. There is a tipping point in a case and who knows how juries mind may precisely work they may, also, there is the idea of which I don't know how this would have worked to the trial, that someone may have a motive if they have outstanding charges. Juries, for all I know, maybe more worried about people with outstanding charges. They may find it less that to My Lords point about whether one would buy the used car from a man with a fraud outstanding charge that the layperson may have more worries about accepting people with outstanding charges than with convictions. All I say, it is cumulative, and when you can't cross examine the witness and the evidence is as important as this evidence was to be denied ammunition like that is material in terms of the test we have."
p1,00:41:28.930,00:41:30.490,spk_2,What about the last sentence?

p1,00:41:32.250,00:41:39.960,spk_2,of the charges. I think
p1,00:41:39.960,00:41:57.090,spk_4,"that was inevitable because I think that was to do with this transaction. I've discussed that this morning with the Advocate Depute because we think the outstanding charge was the fact that he would have been in trial for this particular one. So that that was inevitable, that that was just part of the general picture. Because he was the man who was caught with the £30,000"
p1,00:41:57.480,00:41:58.300,spk_3,so
p1,00:41:58.300,00:42:23.610,spk_4,that that was it wasn't anything that wasn't something disclosed. That was something in the true sense. It wasn't something disclosed. That was something which was known by definition. He must have had the outstanding charge because he would have been charged with that. And at least other crime of dishonesty.
p1,00:42:24.490,00:42:24.820,spk_5,This
p1,00:42:24.820,00:42:26.510,spk_4,position is. And I think it's

The defence asked for this. This was specifically requested. I think that's common ground between us. The defence sought the material both previous convictions and outstanding challenges, but in terms of the culture of the day, they did not get them."

p1,00:46:28.620,00:46:30.000,spk_3,with the matter. They

In other words, everything with an agreement with would detain this court for no time at all, they would simply send the matters I've actually been spending time on back to another court to deal with. Now that has not been the approach which I can find this court has taken. Well"
p1,00:46:59.370,00:47:05.000,spk_2,it may depend on the case. There could be cases where the facts are so complex.

p1,00:47:07.150,00:47:08.930,spk_4,That's right. I concede

p1,00:47:24.820,00:47:53.760,spk_4,"I totally followed that. And I can see there are complex cases where it would go back. All I would say is, this is not one such. And when I look at the cases which have been here, for example, The Sinclair, for example, where this court has looked at it and then decided to materiality test is satisfied, and this case would be no more difficult to deal with on that basis in a case such as that, in other words, it's"

I accept there may be cases My Lord in the Sinclair case says where the complications of facts are such that you just don't want to get involved in it. But I don't say that this is a case like this, and I'm fortified in that by the Advocate General agreeing with me as far as I can see.

p1,00:49:20.610,00:49:26.420,spk_0,thought 28 says that if we find Article 6 is breached.
p1,00:49:28.850,00:49:38.220,spk_4,"Yes, but it's previous, but it's only breached. That's coming to the same thing because it's only breached if I'm right."
p1,00:49:38.470,00:50:03.650,spk_2,"In his case, I think is the same as it is in McInnis. I think it's pretty well word for word the same in the issue. And McInnis is really whether, in looking at the Article 6(1) can take account of the functions of the appeal court in having the ability to remedy a failure to disclose by looking at all the material. Discuss in more detail."

p1,00:50:04.880,00:50:20.700,spk_4,"I don't understand paragraph 28 to be disagreeing with what I'm saying because he is saying there that where it's been breached then would cause the conviction, breached arises for more than just nondisclosure. Further, to be a breach, I have to get over the materiality hurdle as well. I accept,"
p1,00:50:20.700,00:50:35.280,spk_3,"that well, there is no --  with respect, Mr Jackson, there is a breach. Yes, there's a duty of disclosure, and there is a breach of that duty of disclosure so that to that extent, Article 6(1)"

p1,00:50:36.610,00:50:49.920,spk_3,"violated. The question, nonetheless, is whether or not looking at the whole thing all over there has been, the trial has been unfair or whether or not it's caused a miscarriage of justice. However, one likes to put"

p1,00:51:04.540,00:51:04.750,spk_3,the
p1,00:51:04.750,00:51:11.700,spk_4,court should look at the reasons I have given why the materiality test has been passed and should quash the conviction rather than send it
p1,00:51:11.700,00:51:16.260,spk_2,back. I think the general rule in McInnis accepted the approach that if it's a clear case then it would not be unreasonable for this court to set conviction aside.

The defence may not be impaired as a result of the obligation to disclose not being complied with. It is obvious I submit that a finding that an accused right to disclosure has been violated does not end the analysis. A failure by the crown to disclose material may be incompatible with Article 6(1), but it by no means necessarily follows in my submission that the accused has not had a fair trial in terms of Article 6, or that there has been some other miscarriage of justice and I take up the point made by Lord Roger in McDonald found at tab 10, paragraph 77."

Thus, we have a clear and simple case in which the convictions of the prosecution witnesses, witness was not, were not disclosed when they should have been as a result of inadvertence or oversight. What is the effect of such non disclosure? If a defendant is convicted in evidence of convictions in the part of the prosecution witness, then comes to light? There is no simple and straightforward answer to that question. The answer will depend on the weight of the evidence in the case. Apart from the evidence of the witness whose convictions have not been disclosed, the greater the weight of the other evidence, the less significance, other things being equal. The non disclosure is likely to have had. The answer will also dependent on the extent to which the credibility and honesty of the prosecution witness, whose convictions have not been disclosed is at the heart of the case. If, as here, the prosecution witness whose convictions have not been disclosed, is the only witness against a defendant, the defendant and his credibility and honesty are squarely an issue, and the jury are led to believe that the witness is of good character when such is not the case, then there is a strong ground for contending that the conviction is unsafe. And one can see that as an obvious example where non disclosure would have a quite significant impact upon the actual live issues at the trial."

But, yes, it's part of the overall picture of the status, as it were of the deceased witness. In other words, My Lords, in my submission, is not the application of a simple equation. Nondisclosure equals unfair trial. And a good example of this can be seen in an English case that the case of the Queen against Craven Tab 16 of the Joint"

The murder weapon being a pint glass a third party fingerprint was found on the glass and this was not disclosed on the face of it that might give rise to real prejudice. But as explained in the case, the court considered that the undisclosed evidence in the light of the material available and as to what extent the non disclosure affected the verdict of the jury In so doing, the quote was not restricted to a consideration of that evidence in the context of the information which was available to the jury at trial. But it was entitled to look at the evidence now available. This properly secured the rights of the defence for the purposes of Article 6."

It is necessary, firstly, to have regard to the particular vice, which it is said to constitute unfairness, and secondly, the extent to which the Appeal court is in a position to correct that Vice at one end of the scale will come. Those cases, such as those in which the prosecution amounts to an abuse of process where clearly vice cannot be corrected on appeal, is of sufficient. It is of itself sufficient to justify the conclusion that the proceedings are unfair and, as the Lord Justice Rose held in the case of Mullen, referred to in the case in the judgment of Lord Chief Justice unsafe Further. There are cases where the independence of the trial court is called into question and I want to reference to Finley against the United Kingdom,"

The serious offence was entitled to First Instance tribunal, which fully met the requirements of Article 6(1) again, there could be no question of that being capable of being rectified by the process of appeal. Reference is further made to Edwards to which I'll return to. However, Edwards, the European Court of Human Rights had to consider the question of whether or not the fact that evidence had been withheld from the defence at trial rendered the proceedings unfair. The same issue as is raised in the case in this case, the Court of Appeal in that case consider that the evidence that had been withheld in the light of all the material available and concluded that the evidence that had been withheld would have made no difference to the jury's verdict. The European Court of Human Rights held at the proceedings were not unfair, although there had been a defect in the trial at first instance that had been cured by fair and proper consideration of the evidence in the Court of Appeal."

p1,01:08:17.170,01:08:30.170,spk_6,"Yes, when you cross on, page 23 explains the particular status that he has the bottom of page 23 line 23. You will have to decide whether"
p1,01:08:30.170,01:08:31.109,spk_0,what
p1,01:08:31.120,01:12:01.400,spk_6,"should be, John Stronach said is credible and reliable, and in doing so, you will have to exercise great care. You will have to approach what he said with caution, and this is for a number of reasons. First of all, it's not evidence not given under oath and explains that, and he also explains that not had the opportunity to see him being cross examined at line, 16 and 17 not tested in Line 19, His lordship said, It seems pretty clear, accepted, really at all hands by both the crown and by the defence that in the course of what he told the police, he told many lies both about what happened on the 24th of November and about other matters. Much of what he said was contradicted by the contents of surveillance logs, that should be, and the other evidence, such as the searches of his house referred to in the drug inquiry or whatever. There is, however, a passage in which in which the crown do seek to rely. And that is what he said about a man called Stevie from Abran Hill, whom he described and said that he had asked him to take the car down to Kilmarnock. And the crown suggests first that you could infer that that was a reference to the first accused and that if you took the part that you if you accepted Mr Stronach's account, the man, Stephen made an arrangement and told him to take the car rejected his qualifications that it was for the purpose of selling the car and took along with other evidence and took that along with other evidence in the case. Then it pointed to the first accused being concerned in the supply of drugs the crown suggests to you. You could find comfort for accepting that particular part of his evidence in the interview, from the evidence of Detectives Sergeant Duncan Smith to the effect that he saw the usual car in the driveway of the house about lunchtime on the day. And also, I think the Advocate Depute referred to in evidence that on the 27th of November, the first accused took the passport of John Stronach to Airdrie Sheriff Court for all the the purpose of Mr Stronach being released on bail on the charge that related to the journey to Ayeshire and that has a compelling piece of evidence as well in my submission, and indeed that there was reference to the other journey linking the appellant. And it's described of as being a spectacular coincidence by the Advocate Depute if he were not connected. And that, of course, was precisely a matter for the jury to assess. But he was not presented by the crown it's ultimately a matter for the jury was not presented as an absolutely honest and truthful man, and indeed, while is not evidence, of course of what the Advocate Depute said in his speech. The acceptance of him being a liar would my submission have carried significant weight in the deliberation of the jury and the invitation to only rely on those parts of his evidence which were supported by other evidence, was another safeguard. So it was pretty clear in my submission. This is a witness who could not be trusted, but on key parts, the Crown invited the jury to accept evidence which was capable of being looked at elsewhere in my submission that there was plainly sufficient evidence without the 259 statement and the direct link because --"
p1,01:12:01.410,01:12:02.360,spk_3,nobody disputes that.
p1,01:12:02.610,01:13:22.990,spk_6,"No but it was there and in my submission, had the witness been presented is entirely credible. With nothing lurking around this at all, the position might have been different. But that's not the situation in my submission. This is a case where even applying the lowest possible threshold test to determine whether there has been an unfair trial, that test would not be met. There is no prejudice, I submit. In this case, it's not a case where there was not even no risk of prejudice. There was no prejudice but what?My learned friend Mr Jackson says that he wants all the bullets, but that my respectful submission appears to mean no more than to fire the last bullet into the dead body. There's no purpose to be achieved with that. That jury could be in no doubt of the stated status of Stronach. And in these circumstances, this would have added nothing to the significant body of material and successful attack upon the credibility of the witness, as recognised by the trial judge and therefore applying the two stage tests in my submission that the parents should fail in this, that this would not have affected the outcome of the trial at all."
p1,01:13:25.800,01:13:27.120,spk_2,That brings us to disposal.
p1,01:13:28.130,01:13:44.570,spk_6,"Yes, on disposal as set out in the case, the Crown invite  Your Lordships, to simply firstly, answer question one in the negative. But if if Your Lordships take a different view that the appellant"
p1,01:13:45.300,01:13:47.020,spk_0,"Sorry, what question one?"
p1,01:13:48.250,01:13:48.690,spk_6,That's
p1,01:13:49.260,01:14:01.330,spk_2,"whether the failure was incompatible with the right to a fair trial. That is, on the basis that the violation can be cured by an analysis of all the materials by the appeal court."
p1,01:14:01.370,01:14:11.440,spk_6,"Yes, yes, that's that's the position. And if Your Lordships take the view that the appeal court"

p1,01:14:12.310,01:14:19.670,spk_6,not approached this in a proper way then the Crowns invitation is to send the case back for it to be considered.
p1,01:14:20.750,01:14:20.990,spk_2,But
p1,01:14:21.000,01:14:23.480,spk_3,you except that they didn't approach in the proper way.

p1,01:14:24.900,01:14:29.400,spk_3,You accept they didn't approach the proper way because they ruled out?
p1,01:14:31.470,01:14:32.950,spk_2,"Well,"
p1,01:14:32.950,01:14:35.540,spk_3,you're not supporting the court of appeal on that?
p1,01:14:37.470,01:14:37.710,spk_2,"Oh,"
p1,01:14:37.710,01:15:15.690,spk_6,"no, I'm not supporting no, no, no. But they held that there was no miscarriage of justice. So that's what I mean to say that ultimately concluded there was no miscarriage of justice. But I don't see and I make it clear I don't seek to support the observation that under there was insuperable difficulty in employment deploying outstanding cases. I don't seek to support that at all, and it's pretty obvious. Perhaps nothing further need to be said about that. But I don't support that unless it's taken to mean its application to the present case only, although pretty ordinary reading suggests a wider application. But if that's what is meant, I don't support"
p1,01:15:15.690,01:15:17.340,spk_2,that it's difficult to believe --
p1,01:15:18.350,01:15:19.080,spk_6,"yes,"
p1,01:15:19.440,01:15:20.720,spk_0,yes.
p1,01:15:22.660,01:15:26.450,spk_6,But so but if you --
p1,01:15:27.090,01:15:35.390,spk_0,"so who has to take the decision whether this failure to disclose these, in addition, made a haporth or a pennyworth of difference?"
p1,01:15:36.060,01:15:40.630,spk_6,Your Lordships to take that view and just to conclude that it made no difference and that's
p1,01:15:40.730,01:15:42.920,spk_0,it for us. We wouldn't want to send that
p1,01:15:44.480,01:15:49.630,spk_3,"we can. We can dismiss the appeal, but we can't. We can't allow it outright is that"
p1,01:15:49.640,01:15:57.640,spk_6,I'm not especially pressing either. I made it clear that equally if the court was
p1,01:15:58.110,01:16:02.820,spk_3,"crowned, take this idea of where is it? I got this idea of sending it back from what is that?"
p1,01:16:02.830,01:16:17.540,spk_6,"It's really more a principal and perhaps designed to stop Your Lordships being troubled with many cases which will have a lot of events turning on the evidence. This is quite straightforward in terms of the evidence, but many cases will not be, and"
p1,01:16:18.230,01:16:35.910,spk_2,"one is aware that some feeling in Edinburgh to adventurous exercising the functions which they believe they have. But it's clear, and I think the Lord justice general acceptance is in the Guinness. There really is no reason why we shouldn't simply do the sensible thing and dispose of the case here."
p1,01:16:36.300,01:16:38.240,spk_6,I don't argue against that.
p1,01:16:41.120,01:16:41.290,spk_1,I
p1,01:16:41.290,01:16:53.010,spk_0,"mean, now that it's known that you ought to disclose this, that and the other. I mean, why do we have to get it here? Why can't it all go back for another shot in Edinburgh?"
p1,01:16:54.920,01:16:55.000,spk_3,I
p1,01:16:55.000,01:17:02.050,spk_0,"mean, isn't there some process of referring back appeals that have been dismissed on a wrong basis, or whatever it may be?"
p1,01:17:03.300,01:17:10.800,spk_6,"Yes. And the first suggestion was that that could be done. If Your Lordships are not satisfied, that --"
p1,01:17:10.900,01:17:32.290,spk_0,"But why does it have to come near us? I mean, look, you know, I mean, after Murtar, presumably everybody recognised. As you're recognising that here's a case where not only should the previous convictions, but also the outstanding charges should have been disclosed. Okay, Yes. Why? Why? Why can't it then go back to the appeal court in Edinburgh for them too? Why is it going to come"
p1,01:17:32.290,01:17:33.410,spk_3,here?
p1,01:17:34.260,01:17:35.790,spk_6,"First, I didn't bring it"

p1,01:17:38.010,01:17:41.220,spk_0,"I mean, there's no mechanics. I"
p1,01:17:41.230,01:18:03.930,spk_3,"mean, they have decided, despite what had been said in Holland or whatever it was that they didn't take the view that outstanding charges and that was that's the view they took. Once they've taken that there is no mechanism, as far as I know, short of going to the commission or whatever it is for dealing with that matter. So they took the obvious route and they came here."
p1,01:18:03.940,01:18:09.730,spk_2,"We gave permission in this case because, first of all, we had to be satisfied because of the devolution issue."
p1,01:18:10.290,01:18:10.930,spk_3,which
p1,01:18:10.930,01:18:29.880,spk_2,"you accept. This court gave permission for the point to be argued so it is properly before us. The question really is having having, as it were, received the case and examined it.

p1,01:23:00.900,01:24:14.170,spk_4,"said most of what I want to say, but just one of two things, perhaps it has to be remembered. in my submission. Why in the first place outstanding cases are material which should be disclosed at all, and it is because there is a recognition that they are the sort of things the category of things which a defence counsel would wish to have. They're not unimportant matters which of course, ties in with the fact that in this case, the defence asked for them. So they are matters of some importance or else they would not be material which required to be disclosed. That in my submission is the very important starting point. And the second thing I would say, and only this, it is, I hesitate to use the word disingenuous and I mean no disrespect by it but for the Advocate Depute, to say that would have been finding into a dead body is not consistent with the position adopted by the Advocate Depute at the trial because he was not presented to the jury as a dead body, he was presented as someone who could be used on a matter of great significance."
p1,01:24:14.310,01:24:18.830,spk_2,"Of course, he hadn't been hammered with the outstanding, with the previous convictions at that"
p1,01:24:18.830,01:25:01.020,spk_4,"stage. Indeed indeed, but I venture that the Advocate Depute would not have been abandoning this piece of evidence no matter what had been put to him. I don't think no matter how many bullets have been fired into him, he would not have become a corpse as far as the Advocate Depute was concerned, and that is why he goes on to say in the passage I read. I will not read again. He describes this as being a significant piece of evidence. Now you cannot have it both ways if the previous convictions would have turned him into a dead body then the previous convictions plus the outstanding charges certainly turned him into a dead body."
p1,01:25:01.940,01:25:02.180,spk_2,And
p1,01:25:02.180,01:25:38.660,spk_4,"if he is that, then the fact that he became a material piece of evidence almost by definition means something has gone wrong. So it must be disingenuous for the Advocate Depute, describe him at any stage is a dead body because if this disclosed material had made him that, then the appeal in my submission was required to succeed because clearly it would have mattered because the fact of the matter he was not treated by the advocate deputy as a corpse, he was treated and would always have been treated as being of some significance"
p1,01:25:38.660,01:25:44.900,spk_3,He was treated as a highly flawed witness but on this one area he was to be accepted that is what they say.
p1,01:25:45.350,01:26:08.630,spk_4,"Indeed, but it is that one area that was an area of extreme significance and that is my point that this was one area of great significance, and the question is whether he could be relied upon at all. And that, of course, is the cumulative effect and tipping point. I don't think I can add anything else. I just listened to"

p1,01:54:17.940,01:56:37.630,spk_5,"Though it is not apparent that what was the appropriate test was a matter of argument before the judicial Committee and Lord Roger's test is not repeated in Sinclair, which is concerned with underscored statements. In the latter case, Lord Roger was in a position to conclude that the appellant's Solicitor Advocate quote would have been in a position to cross examine Mr Ritchie effectively, and the appellant's trial as a whole would have been fair, paragraph 50. Lord Roger's test has been used or abused in argument in this jurisdiction to suggest that the threshold of reversing the verdict of a jury in a non disclosure and analogous cases is low. That this may be a [inaudible] of Lord Roger's words in the context of determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice or we think an unfair trial, a robust test is required. The test of a real risk of prejudice to the defence was rightly, in our view, adopted in Kelly v Her Majesty Advocate, Paragraph 33. My Lords I turn to that part in a moment. But the second reason I say that the court adopted the wrong test can be shown that adopted the wrong test is the way in which it treated the previously withheld evidence in this case, in the context of the rest of the evidence. When the appeal court came to look at what was not disclosed at the trial, they appear to have taken a very strict approach, suggesting that the barrier has been raised. My Lords, it was never argued, referring to the first part of this point. It was never argued in the Appeal Court that there was a low threshold. What was argued was that, quite rightly, my submission and it's accepted by the crown was the threshold. The test is materiality. It could never be suggested that a piece of immaterial information such as who took photographs, could affect the outcome of anything. It maybe, if the person who took the photographs heard a comment by a complainer, for example, but generally speaking, it can't, its materiality. Except it was also accepted at the trial that the court must make some assessment of the withheld evidence in the context of the evidence that was learned at trial. So"
p1,01:56:37.640,01:56:59.630,spk_2,"just to be a little more specific, we're dealing, I think, with the witness, Brian Pearce. Yes, that's right. And he attended an identification parade and he made certain remarks when he was leaving the parade, which were recorded but not disclosed. That's material. So the question is, what one makes of that there having been a failure to disclose?"
p1,01:56:59.850,01:59:25.450,spk_5,"Yes, the failure to, failure to disclose in relation to Mr Pearce is possibly better understood. I would submit My Lords if we understood the rest of the evidence in the case, and particularly what Mr Pearce had to say from the moment the police spoke to him, and that can be encapsulated fairly briefly. My Lords would trust my recollection of the narrative without having to go specifically to each statement. There was an incident, not an untypical incident, of course, a fast moving, violent event where lots of people are doing various things to different people at different times and Mr Pearce was one of the stewards on duty at the particular hotel where this incident occurred. Now, when he first spoke to the police about three o'clock in the morning shortly after the event, he initially described two people as having attacked Mr Sweeney, the complainer. He did not describe in his first statement to the police anyone with a black jacket, a black leather jacket and by that reference, I am talking about the appellant, Ian McInnis. In a second statement given that same day about 8:40 PM on the 16th of December 2000, Mr Pearce then introduced in his information to the police the description of the roundhouse kicker, who was ultimately, in his view, Mr McInnis. And it was in that second statement that the first indication of some error or some uncertainty in his position was shown because his first statement describes somebody with a tan fleece jacket and a scar on his face having actually been involved attacking the complainer. His second statement, he made it plain that tan fleece with this scar was not involved in attacking the complainer. So he started to change his position slightly, at least as far as the police record was concerned. Now, on that occasion, on the 16th of December, about 20:40 hours, he was also shown a photo board and the photo board, and there's an error in the case that was presented and i'll clarify that for My Lords. But the photo board showed what the police would have regarded that time as possible suspects. Undoubtedly, that's the police"

So his position, we can see changed from the very"

Originally, when the application for leave to appeal was discussed and granted, it was in relation to the test to be applied and the approach to be followed once that test has been identified. The Crown's position is that they look at the proceedings, I suppose, in the round. But take a look at the proceedings taken as a whole, there's a slightly different position adopted by the crown in this."
p1,02:01:40.320,02:02:17.310,spk_2,"Well, it's not very easy for us. It's also a mistaken dates somewhere because one version refers to trial is ending on the 15th December 2002 which doesn't seem to be right. And Crowns version says that trial ended on the 13th of December 2001 and then we've got, as you point out, different issues. But are you are you agreed the issue that we should really be addressing is the one in the crown version, which directs attention to the question whether the procedure before the appeal court was sufficient to remedy the unfairness?"

p1,02:03:36.010,02:03:39.620,spk_0,I wondered why we haven't got some convenient statement of the succession

He does that on the second page of the statement, which is appendix part 2 page 4. Towards the top, he says, he says, I saw one of the group kicked the boy, complaining Sweeney in the face with what I would describe as a roundhouse, a round kick which later became a roundhouse, I would describe was 28 to 30 years of age dark hair, which is quite long. Medium build, 5 ft 9. Now, you"

p1,02:06:23.280,02:07:46.870,spk_5,"he says. I've been shown photographs, but I cannot identify anyone or recognise anyone from the photographs that I have been shown, I can identify all the persons I've mentioned. With the exception of the male with the black hooded top. In the exclusion of the person with the tan jacket, My Lord's will see that at the first page of that statement of the 16th of December 20:40 he commences that in the middle of the second paragraph in the bottom where he says one of the people involved in the fight was David Wong, who I already identified. I also identified a male in my original statement, and it gives the description, which is the tan fleece scar on the face and says this male was not involved in the fight outside. As far as I could see, he was involved in the initial fight inside the hotel, so it's a somewhat different position from his first statement. But the reference to the photographs, My Lord, must be photographs shown that the police thought were at least included a suspect. This statement was taken, of course, at the second statement was taken, of course, at 20:40 hours on the 16th of December."
p1,02:07:48.760,02:07:49.110,spk_2,But

p1,02:08:02.360,02:08:02.500,spk_4,[Background noise].
p1,02:08:10.380,02:09:21.750,spk_5,"My Lords would see that is a production which was, in fact, a police photo board was produced during the hearing on the appeal where the suspect is stated. There is being Paul McInnis at image number four, but the witness who has shown this, stated as Brian Godkin. But the most in my submission, My Lords. Perhaps significant feature of that is the time at which that photo board was created, which is 11:11 on the 16th of December, some seven hours or so before Mr Pearce was asked about the incident that evening and before he was in fact shown the photo board. So it does seem likely. Very likely indeed, that Mr Pearce would have been shown a photo board, which included a picture of Mr McInnis. Unfortunately, the board that was shown to Mr Pearce was not produced either at the trial or on appeal. But does point to a reasonable likelihood, strong likelihood perhaps that a photoboard such as that with Mr McInnis on it was shown to this witness."
p1,02:09:24.600,02:09:25.430,spk_2,Yes.

p1,02:09:33.620,02:09:58.090,spk_5,"The test that was identified and applied in McInnis does appear, at least intentionally to have been moved away from the test that was adopted by the Privy Council in Holland. The Hog v Clarke test, which, of course, is common law."
p1,02:09:58.420,02:10:04.960,spk_3,Wouldn't move very far if you just call it if you said the possibility had to be a real possibility.
p1,02:10:09.660,02:10:38.570,spk_5,"The court indicated that I do appreciate that the courts is the test of a real risk of prejudice. The defence was rightly now if you adopted in Kelly v HM Advocate, it's with on having looked at Kelly. Although initially in the application for leave to appeal, it was thought that the Kelly test Kelly test was higher. When one looks at the Kelly test, it's the same test, just different languages. It's the Hog v Clarke test. It uses a different language."
p1,02:10:38.580,02:10:43.560,spk_0,So what? I'm getting awfully lost. What is the correct test on your submission?
p1,02:10:45.080,02:10:56.020,spk_5,"In my submission My Lord, the test is whether the prejudice, which is said to arise, amounts to no more than a loss of opportunity."

p1,02:12:14.410,02:12:14.890,spk_5,"mean,"
p1,02:12:15.490,02:12:30.490,spk_0,"are you criticising that test? You ask, in the respect of the failure has, that caused a real risk of prejudice to the defence? Do you accept that that's correct test or would you say it's a wrong test?"
p1,02:12:30.920,02:13:46.850,spk_5,"It is the correct test My Lord, but in my submission provided the prejudice, the risk of prejudice is not overstated by the court, or at least over applied, perhaps by the court in assessing the materiality of the information that was previously withheld and in a trial of course, the accused need only if anything, raise a reasonable doubt. He need not even raise it. The jury would be directed that if a doubt exists, or if a doubt arises, that sufficient for an acquittal. So where an accused person has been denied the opportunity of pointing to reasonable doubt because a piece of information material information, of course, it's only material has been denied him then he is prejudiced. He's prejudiced at the trial stage because he can't point the jury, the fact finder, who's heard all of the evidence and seeing the witnesses and observed the demeanour he can't point to that piece of material information that raises a reasonable doubt, not a speculative, fanciful doubt but a reasonable doubt. And that could arise from a number of things, and particularly in a case involving identification, where in this particular case, identification was the only issue."
p1,02:13:46.910,02:13:54.870,spk_2,"Is the test described accurately, then, in your case at paragraph 6, page"
p1,02:13:54.870,02:13:55.700,spk_0,12?
p1,02:13:57.030,02:14:08.860,spk_2,"As I read it, you are making the point that there's, as you detected two possible tests, one setting a lower threshold than the"
p1,02:14:08.860,02:14:09.800,spk_5,other? Yes.
p1,02:14:10.210,02:14:23.260,spk_2,"And you're you're picking up what was said in Holland and pointing to the fact that it had some, some predecessors in earlier Scottish authority, particularly in case of Hog v"
p1,02:14:23.260,02:14:24.810,spk_0,Clarke
p1,02:14:25.040,02:14:44.110,spk_2,"and as I read your case, you were asking us to endorse the test as set out in in Hog by Lord Justice General Clyde, Is that right? Yes, My Lord. So is that really the answer to Lord Browne's question that if you wanted it succinctly put you find it in the quotation from Hog against Clark?"
p1,02:14:44.220,02:14:50.320,spk_5,"That is the answer, My Lord but the crown's position is, of course, that the same test was applied in McInnis"
p1,02:14:50.320,02:14:51.270,spk_2,"case. Yes,"
p1,02:14:51.280,02:15:39.440,spk_5,"so we have different forms of words as the court pointed out in McInnis, at least observed in paragraph 20 of McInnis. Suggestion seems to be, for example, Lord Son by introducing the concept of prejudice somehow moved away from a test that was properly applied and the court didn't. Introducing prejudice is, of course, all well, good provided prejudice, the prejudice is properly understood in my submission, the prejudice to the accused must be a loss of opportunity to point to something that could raise a reasonable doubt in the trial because that really is his one chance before the fact finders having heard all of the evidence for an acquittal, that's his one chance."
p1,02:15:39.670,02:16:26.750,spk_2,"It could be said, that that's just one step along the road to a conclusion. First of all, you have to identify this being a devolution issue that there was a breach by the Lord Advocate of the duty of disclosure, and that's accepted here, that the exit statements were not revealed and therefore that breach is there, and then you have flowing from that. The consequence of the fact that you didn't have this material was there was a loss of an opportunity to put that material to the witness at the trial. But that still leaves open the question as to what the net result of that is. The end result, I should say, is, and are we not taken back to the statutory test as to whether there was a miscarriage of justice?"
p1,02:16:28.300,02:17:41.570,spk_5,"Well, there is, the Advocate General for Scotland's touched upon that this morning. This possible, the difficulty with whether it should be a miscarriage of justice or nullity. The devolution issue, of course, raises an issue under Section 57(2), and Lord Osborne in Fraser seems to be suggesting that for so long as the income-- incompatible act persists, the Lord Advocate can't move forward and seek a conviction. Any convictions a nullity seems to be a different test than the one that might be applied for a miscarriage of justice because he does also indicate that in a miscarriage of justice case, what we're looking at, there is a trial that was fairly and properly conducted. But for whatever reason, reading into what Lord Osborn suggested the accused should not have been convicted, it turns out, perhaps with fresh evidence he was entirely innocent. That's a miscarriage of justice. It seems to be quite different test. But what I'm saying, My Lord is in the section 57 (2) and one with Lord Osborne and this, of course, in a section 57 (2) issue for so long as that breach persisted, Lord Advocate should not have sought a conviction."
p1,02:17:41.660,02:17:46.920,spk_2,I think you need to explain a little more what Section 57(2) is talking about. That's in the Scotland Act isn't it?
p1,02:17:47.000,02:18:56.110,spk_5,"Section 57(2) of the Scotland Act, which is the provision which makes it unlawful for a Scottish minister. Of course, the Lord Advocate of the Scottish Minister under the act to act incompatibly with the convention right and the incompatible, the sorry should the issue of whether an act is incompatible is something that seems to, of course, some debate in Scotland because it seems to be viewed as something that must be a breach of a convention right, whereas in my submission, My Lord, properly understood, incompatible is simply, as Lord Clyde said is an act. It's in conflict with the convention right. There may never be a breach of an actual violation, albeit there may be an attempt to breach. Sorry there. There may never be an actual violation, although although there may be an attempt to violate an article of the convention, so an incompatible act doesn't necessarily result in a violation."
p1,02:18:57.360,02:19:04.950,spk_0,"I'm getting completely lost. I mean, is it your submission that the mere nondisclosure? Because that on the face of it"
p1,02:19:04.950,02:19:05.800,spk_2,is
p1,02:19:05.809,02:19:15.400,spk_0,"inconsistent with the obligation to disclose under Article 6, that is incurable by any appeal process?"
p1,02:19:17.219,02:20:05.820,spk_5,"The mere nondisclosure provided material information is curable. If the court applies the proper test, it is curable. I think I have to accept that My Lord, the Strasbourg Court seemed to accept that as well. It is curable, provided the proper tests applied. But in a case where the Lord Advocate is responsible for the withholding of the information in this case, whether personally vicariously is not relevant but where the information is withheld by the prosecutor. The court obviously looks at whether that was material. Could it have made a difference? And if that information could have made a difference to the outcome of the trial, then the high court should have quashed the conviction."
p1,02:20:05.820,02:20:45.770,spk_3,"The only question is whether it is whether it has to be a real possibility. The Court assess that, I don't think you really dispute it has to be a real possibility. It can't be a fanciful or speculative possibility. It's got to be a real possibility. Or as the court put it in whatever the case is called a real risk. I mean, that's that's it. And the question here is I would have thought the only question at this stage is whether that's whether that test was satisfied here or not. And the court of appeal said no and you say they, they misapplied it is that right? Right and"
p1,02:20:45.770,02:20:51.310,spk_2,that's really what it all comes to. How we analyse paragraph 20 and the Court of Appeals judgment.
p1,02:20:51.320,02:20:51.690,spk_5,Yes.
p1,02:20:53.840,02:21:24.060,spk_2,"And paragraph 21 begins with the first sentence says applying that test was the present appellant denied a fair trial and if the answer to that is yes, then that would amount to a miscarriage of justice and lead to the setting aside of the conviction. That's the step in which step by which they proceed. And do I understand that you would say that's the correct way to go about it so long as the correct test is applied in following that route?"
p1,02:21:25.090,02:21:48.860,spk_5,"So long as the correct test is applied to, the court seems to have wanted to move away from the test that led up to higher test. So although the words appear similar when we look at the way in which the court actually applied the test to the evidence in this case where identification was an issue and Mr Pearce or in relation to Mr Pearce was very little required to put him over the edge and out of consideration by the jury, perhaps we may have disregarded his evidence?"
p1,02:21:48.870,02:21:51.870,spk_3,Do you dispute the real risk of prejudice?
p1,02:21:52.430,02:21:54.890,spk_5,"No, I don't dispute a real risk of prejudice."
p1,02:21:55.510,02:22:10.000,spk_0,"And he comes back to it later on the same page, five lines up from the bottom critical issue as well. The non disclosure of that information presented a real risk of prejudice, the conduct or offence. So he stated it twice you. You except it's the right test. You say misapplied?"
p1,02:22:10.290,02:22:10.860,spk_5,Misapplied.
p1,02:22:18.660,02:22:23.700,spk_2,"Well, it's a fairly short point, Mr Carroll, is there anything more you would like to show us"

p1,02:22:26.860,02:22:36.310,spk_3,"Why do you say, Mr--  Just as I'm clear, I'm not quite sure I've grasped the facts well enough to know why exactly you say misapplied."
p1,02:22:37.080,02:23:34.940,spk_5,"The words, the words used the word obviously are clearly similar to the words used in Kelly. The Kelly Test the Kelly judgment. When it's analysed, it's clear it is in tune with Hog v Clarke. Although the words are different, it is in tune with Clarke. And in Kelly, the court did look at the evidence that had been withheld properly, analysed it in the context of the evidence that had been led at the trial and said it would have made no difference. It is quite clear it would have made no difference and indeed went on to say that the Crown could have used the evidence that had been withheld and advanced its own case, so there was no realistic prospect there of raising a reasonable doubt in that trial, and therefore therefore there was no prejudice in the McInnis case. The court in paragraph 20 does indicate that it seems to be unhappy with what's being said about the Hog test. The Hog v Clarke test,"
p1,02:23:35.580,02:23:35.840,spk_0,and
p1,02:23:35.840,02:24:06.320,spk_5,"although it the court then talks about the Kelly tests and the real test is, as explained in Kelly, when the court goes on, then to analyse the evidence that was not withheld, namely the uncertainty about Mr Pearce's evidence, it then takes what was a very strict approach which it shouldn't have taken. It takes a strict approach, pointing to in my submission, pointing to the conclusion that the court had adopted, albeit the words are there, but had in fact adopted a different approach."
p1,02:24:06.330,02:24:07.470,spk_3,"Where do you see that, Mr Carroll?"
p1,02:24:08.460,02:24:10.770,spk_5,I say that because the evidence --

So although the words --"

Of course, counsel had available a note that was taken within the proper fiscals office. And this was taken by the solicitor, with the representative of the crown seeming to read from the crown precognition. But he wouldn't be able to put the gist of that note to witness. He could only just cross examine around the generality of that note in order to attack the witness. He was required to have the witness's statement and put the words to the witness, just actually what he did say. And in the exit statement in relation to this parade,"

p1,02:29:05.560,02:29:47.200,spk_2,"I think the Court of Appeal appreciate that in the last four lines, because what they're then doing is seeing what could be made, what could be made out of this.

And that's that's a basis for saying, well, let's let's give you that amount of credit for the fact that this was withheld will therefore be useful material to you for those reasons.

p2,00:02:04.170,00:03:45.210,spk_1,"The test having been identified what the court seems to think in my submission, is stated that Paragraph 20 of the judgment in the closing remarks at Paragraph 20, when the court refers to the possible misreading of Lord Rodgers words, We venture to think an unfair trial, and just after that the court says, A robust test is required. Now, that my submission suggests the raising of the bar for an appellant who has been denied access to information. But further indication of the way in which the court applied it may then be seen if My Lords look over the page there to about halfway down Paragraph 22 on the following page, which is page 19 in the original printed report, the court is looking at the evidence. The withheld evidence, to use that expression and says, Had the exit statement of 17 journey have been available to put to Pierce when being cross-examined in relation to administer the roundhouse kick that would, in its qualified form, hardly have constituted a coup de grâce. Now it does appear, in my respectful submission, My Lords, that what the court is looking for here, having stated that the test is, and then said it must be robust, is then looking for a coup de grâce. And that is not something that I would suggest is required in a trial, in a thin case such as this, thin on identification, all the jury may be looking for in relation to Mr Pierce's admittedly shaky evidence on identification is something that puts them over the edge."
p2,00:03:45.540,00:03:47.090,spk_0,Tipping the balance.
p2,00:03:47.090,00:05:12.660,spk_1,"Yes it tips the balance. Yes. Yes, My Lord. And in my submission, My Lords, it cannot properly be said that this could not have raised the reasonable doubt. And the loss of opportunity to put that information to the witness should have been available, should have been, as I say, remedied by the High Court without the High Court looking at such high burden really, onus on the accused to get beyond a robust test, which it's not suggested there's a robust test, because arguably Kelly test is, in fact, lower than the test in Hogg v Clark. Because Hogg v Clark seems to suggest that the accused requires to establish that he was in some shape or form, prejudiced by the loss of opportunity. Whereas in Kelly, it's just that risk that requires to be identified. And it may be that the use of the word prejudice throughout many of our reports in Scotland, Scots law, the word prejudice, has perhaps, in the mind of the court, elevated the obstacle, if that's the correct term, has raised the obstacle to the accused because of the notion that it's in some way a robust test and requires the piece of evidence requires to deliver a coup de grâce."
p2,00:05:12.940,00:05:23.460,spk_0,"So you are saying that provided one properly understands many of these words, real risk of prejudice would be the right test? Yes. But you have to understand what it really means. Yes, My Lord."
p2,00:05:23.460,00:05:36.510,spk_1,"And when those factors, that's the identification of the test. The way in which the court viewed the test and then the way in which the court applied the test to the evidence in this case are all taken together."
p2,00:05:36.520,00:05:38.930,spk_3,Are you inviting us to apply the test?
p2,00:05:38.940,00:05:41.850,spk_1,"I'm inviting this court to apply the test, My Lord, yes."
p2,00:05:43.270,00:05:54.090,spk_3,So the question for us is whether we regard the failure to disclose and there's all these reasons as giving rise to a real risk of prejudice.
p2,00:05:54.100,00:06:38.620,spk_1,"Yes. And if the test is applied without this appendage robust, and without seeking a coup de grâce, then we're back to where we were in Kelly, in fact, we're even back to where we were in Hogg v Clark, which does appear to be, and I think this is the part of the Crown's argument in this case, that the Hogg v Clark test is perhaps a [inaudible] test, and the real risk of prejudice is a lower test. So whichever test applies, it is certainly much lower in my submission than the test that's been applied by the High Court in determining this appeal. Unless My Lords wish me to go into the evidence in this case to explain any further why I say that because you --"
p2,00:06:38.620,00:06:39.710,spk_3,"Well, could you just help me on the last part of Paragraph 22,"
p2,00:06:39.710,00:06:42.220,spk_1,the reference
p2,00:06:42.220,00:06:42.880,spk_0,to change of
p2,00:06:42.880,00:06:45.540,spk_1,facial appearance. That's because your
p2,00:06:45.540,00:06:46.690,spk_0,client had grown
p2,00:06:46.690,00:06:51.890,spk_1,"a beard, is it? Well it was said --"
p2,00:06:51.890,00:06:52.780,spk_3,"Or if not, can you explain what that does refer to?"
p2,00:06:52.780,00:07:46.370,spk_1,"Yes, it was said in the identification period report, that the accused for some facial hair because there was an objection taken to the standards on the basis that the accused, the suspect, had a degree facial hair. Now it doesn't -- with respect, it's difficult to know what happened, but it doesn't with respect, seem likely that the police would have conducted an unfair identification parade by parading the only man with a beard. Otherwise, a lawyer present would have objected to it being a full beard and indeed counsel at the trial, having been appraised of that information, may well have raised the issue of whether that identification parade was indeed fair. That didn't happen. And so the reference to a growth, and I think that's about as much as it went at the parade, doesn't seem to have been a growth such as to single out the suspect McInnis on that parade."
p2,00:07:46.900,00:08:19.620,spk_3,"So if we look at the the transcript, which is appendix tab 7 page 131, last few lines, we'll see that the Mr Pierce in evidence said that, Why didn't he actually recognise, That was because I told the police at the time he never had a goatee beard, But on the line-up he had a goatee beard, I couldn't identify him positively. I told that to the police, page 131, and that's reflected in"

p2,00:08:26.030,00:10:15.020,spk_1,"see that, My Lord, but in actual fact, on the information that was disclosed, that's the prior statements of Mr Pierce, he doesn't tell the police the difficulty was in relation to the goatee beard, the person he tells is a precognition officer within the procurator fiscal's office, at some stage, much later on, it seems. I'm sorry I can't hear very well. So he didn't on the, on the statements that were lodged, that is Pierce's prior statements that are lodged with the bundle, he doesn't tell the police that the difficulty was to do with the goatee beard, and the suspect on this parade, the person he tells is, in fact, a precognition officer. That's a person within the procurator fiscal's office at Glasgow who takes a subsequent statement from the witness. He tells that person about the goatee beard. Now, the issue about facial hair, such as it was, would already have been raised in any event within the identification parade reports. And one of those reports was crowned production 19 in the actual trial. So there was already a reference to facial hair. And it doesn't, with respect, appear necessarily damning that the witness would have explained that there was a change of appearance for a number of reasons. It's firstly, the suspect, Mr McInnis, wasn't aware that he was a suspect until August, seven months after the incident. He's perfectly entitled to grow a beard, and nobody suggested that he change his appearance. The parade itself must have been fair, otherwise, one would think that an objection would have been taken, and so this notion that that would in some way have damaged the defence, had that information come out, is mitigated, it's largely eliminated."
p2,00:10:15.020,00:10:27.790,spk_3,"You said, just to be clear, Mr Carroll, you say the first time, the first indication we, in the papers, is a page 35 which is the core of"

Yes. Now you say that's the first time that --"
p2,00:11:00.820,00:11:36.370,spk_1,"That's the first time that that's mentioned, it's not in a police statement. And so counsel, in response to that reference for having told the police, could well have deployed the prior statements and indeed, on one view, had counsel the prior statements, particularly the exit statements, in the parade and even the other prior statements, had council not deployed them in the trial in the face of this evidence, counsel himself may have faced a complaint of failing to provide adequate representation in this case."
p2,00:11:36.370,00:11:37.660,spk_0,"So I say, I mean, he mentioned"
p2,00:11:37.670,00:11:38.450,spk_1,just

p2,00:11:48.420,00:11:50.340,spk_2,"the problem he'd had with the beard, is that it?"
p2,00:11:50.340,00:12:34.640,spk_1,"Yes My Lord. But he mentions that to the procurator fiscal, effectively to the procurator fiscal. Now the precognition, there is a distinction, I should say, between a precognition and a statement. What My Lord is looking at here, starting at page 29 of the core volume is a precognition given to a member of staff within the proper fiscal's office. Now that is a process by which the witnesses brought into the proper fiscal's office and questioned by that member of staff about his evidence and perhaps even any prior statements to ascertain just what it is that witness is likely to say. That document was not disclosed to the defence, and they're not normally disclosed because it's a precognition."
p2,00:12:34.650,00:12:40.370,spk_0,"So you wouldn't be complaining about a failure to disclose, contrary to Article 6, because you've not got this?"
p2,00:12:40.380,00:14:01.820,spk_1,"Not in that, it's not normally disclosed, but what was done in this particular case, it seems, when comparing -- and this comparison was done before the Appeal Court before the hearing, the Appeal Court, was that the member of staff had the solicitor, a Mr Adam, before it, before him rather, in the proper fiscal's office and the member of staff read elements from this actual precognition. In reading the elements from the precognition there is, there was no reading of the difficulty in relation to, for example, photographs in December 2000, on the night following the incident, there was no reference the precognition to that. The reference to the goatee beard, certainly the solicitor would have been aware of of that because there was already, it seems to be a minor issue raised at the identification parade anyway, so there were no surprises there, and there can be no complaint, for example, if the Crown did not disclose this precognition, the defence had enough information from that. And were aware of the essence of this issue with regard to the goatee beard, they knew that and that information --"
p2,00:14:04.680,00:14:10.970,spk_3,"Sorry, I'm not following quite what you're saying quite about that, what was the issue they raised at the parade, the issue they raised at the parade?"
p2,00:14:11.640,00:14:19.270,spk_1,The issue that was raised at the parade was that the suspect was that the suspect was only person on the parade with facial hair.
p2,00:14:19.280,00:14:20.460,spk_3,"Oh, that was raised."
p2,00:14:20.590,00:14:32.090,spk_1,"Yes it was raised at the parade, and the police officer said that, He got in someone else, An additional stand-in, But he wasn't going to be changing the format, The parade"
p2,00:14:32.090,00:14:33.020,spk_2,would continue.
p2,00:14:33.030,00:14:48.030,spk_1,"And, indeed, it did continue. And what I say, My Lords, is that had there been any unfairness as a result of that facial hair or any impropriety as a result of it, then the matter would most likely have been raised in an objection at the trial --"
p2,00:14:48.040,00:14:48.780,spk_0,Which there wasn't.
p2,00:14:48.900,00:15:15.460,spk_1,"Which there wasn't, there was no real issue taken there. And of course, Mr Pierce said, at the trial, that he told the police he had a difficulty about the facial hair. But that is not recorded in the exit statement, so that could have been put to him. And it's not recorded in any of the statements that he gave to the police that he had difficulty over a facial hair. The first reference to facial hair was made by the witness to the procurator fiscal after that identification parade."
p2,00:15:15.710,00:15:34.570,spk_3,"The position, just so -- what the objection, which was taken at the parade, was, and accuses the only guy who's got facial hair, to which the reply was, Yes that's so it doesn't matter because at the time, he didn't have facial hair."
p2,00:15:35.190,00:15:42.950,spk_1,"Yes that's right. As My Lords would see from the photo board that was examined earlier, the photograph of the suspect, in position"

p2,00:15:44.300,00:16:12.630,spk_1,"is no facial hair. And so these matters could have been put to the witness that he hadn't told the police about facial hair. He could be asked, When did you first raise a concern about facial hair? The matters could quite easily have been explored. And indeed, it would be, indeed, unimaginable that counsel in possession of the exit statements would not have raised that. So that may have been enough just to tip the balance in favour of the accused in a thin case on identification."

p2,00:18:54.820,00:18:55.650,spk_0,The critical
p2,00:18:55.650,00:20:07.110,spk_2,"issue, in our view, is whether the principle of equality of arms is breached and references made to the case of Sinkler and Lord Hope and Lord Rodger, it will so be breached, if access to the statement in question would have been a material assistance to the defence, as it plainly would have been in Sinkler, so the denial of access prejudiced that defence, it might also be breached if having regard to the realities of the trial and viewing the matter realistically, the denial of access might have prejudiced the defence, Whether there has been or may have been such prejudice will be a matter for assessment by the Appeal court in the circumstances of each case, such an assessment will not always be a straightforward or easy task, but it will not be an unfamiliar one, the Appeal Court regularly has to assess whether procedural failures at trial have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. So, My Lords, in my respectful submission, it appears that the Appeal Court it was fully appraised of the matters that they had to consider in applying what has now conceded to be the correct test, and Your Lordships have been referred -- and I don't intend to read this out at all of Paragraphs 22"

p2,00:20:20.640,00:20:28.910,spk_2,"considered all of the material before them and for cogent reasons, set out the fact that there was no miscarriage of justice."

p2,00:20:44.990,00:21:25.080,spk_2,"Well, whether something is pitched a little bit high or not, scarcely meets the test of this court, attempting to disturb the conclusions of the Appeal Court who have now, on the concession made, applied the correct test in analysing the matters before them. If they've applied the correct test, if they've looked at all the information before them, and if they arrived at a conclusion in my respectful submission for this court, to disturb that conclusion would require them to find that the reasoning was a logical or fatally flawed, and it doesn't meet any of that criteria at all."
p2,00:21:25.090,00:21:57.580,spk_0,"It may be the same point, but I'm slightly troubled by the phrase, A robust test is required. One's assuming, I think, that there is prima facie, a violation of Article 6, because there's a failure to disclose, and one's then looking at the essence of a fair trial. And is it right to say that you've taken a robust approach to that? In other words, you've got to have a great deal of persuasion that something has gone wrong before you could say that they had actually been a failure to provide a fair trial?"
p2,00:21:57.580,00:22:02.310,spk_2,"My Lords, the test of a real risk of prejudice is robust"

And whether that was described as robust or not in my respectful submission is not particularly the point at issue. The question is, what is the test they actually applied? And the test they actually apply is the real risk of prejudice."

And I would have been attempting to persuade the court that that was an entirely appropriate test to apply."
p2,00:22:55.760,00:23:00.020,spk_0,What does the adjective robust contribute to the application of the test?

So My Lords, in my respectful submission, looking at the way the math was set out in Paragraph 20 the court is familiar with the matter is that it has to consider when deciding or not, whether, in this case, a real risk of prejudice it was made"

It was in my respectful submission, that was a conclusion the court was entirely entitled to reach based on the material before it."

Now, My Lords, will have read the statement of case for the respondent, where there is an analysis of what Lord Rodgers said in Holland, and perhaps I needn't go into it, standing the concession now made.

p2,00:28:37.330,00:29:53.140,spk_2,"paragraph and, My Lords, will bear in mind that the case of Holland dealt not only with issues of non-disclosure but also dealt with issues of identification, particularly adult identification and also issues of previous convictions, if I remember correctly. And in Paragraph 82 it's set out that, clearly, if the appellants convictions had been revealed to the jury, this might have well been a disastrous consequence to adopt the Lord Justice Clark's description, but given what Miss Lin said in evidence and Miss Gilchrist's claim that she did not know what was meant by gear, and I am unable to say that cross-examination of the complainers about the outstanding drugs charges would inevitably have led to the Crown being permitted to cross-examine the appellant on his previous convictions, Information about the outstanding charges might therefore have played a useful part in the defence effort to undermine the credibility of the crime principal witness in charge two, At least that possibility, he says, Cannot be excluded. One cannot tell for sure what the effect of such cross-examination would have been, But applying the test suggested by Lord Justice General Clyde in Hogg v Clark, I cannot say that the council was unable to cross-examine in that way, it might not possibly have affected the jury's majority verdict on charge number three."
p2,00:29:53.430,00:30:19.610,spk_3,"Now the situation was that this was a very material thing in one sense, because here she was saying that she didn't know what year in this drug related sense was, and here was an outstanding charge relating to drug offences, and the only reply to that which had come from the Lord Justice Clark, If I remember rightly, was, Oh well it would have been very risky to raise that because you have put your, You would have been open to cross examination on your prior convictions --"

p2,00:31:21.990,00:31:23.410,spk_2,Correct.

p2,00:31:45.450,00:31:45.970,spk_3,Yes.
p2,00:31:46.780,00:33:55.230,spk_2,"And what he says is this, But the ultimate question is whether the trial as a whole was fair, And that question can only be decided by the same court, considering all its relevant strengths and weaknesses, including any breaches of specific safeguards and Article 6 together, It follows that although the issues relating to identification and non-disclosure were argued in sequence of the hearing before the board, in deciding whether the appellant can be said to have a fair trial, the board must consider all the relevant elements together. So, My Lords, in my respectful submission, with the Lord Rodger dealing with the issue of dock identification Paragraphs 47 to 63, non-disclosure of outstanding charges, Paragraphs 64 to 75, and the failure to disclose a remark made by a witness at Paragraph 76, he then correctly, in my respectful submission, at Paragraph 77, again sums up the position, saying this, It is now necessary to consider whether taken as a whole, the appellant's trial was fair in terms of Article 6(1), and that's with reference to Paragraph 43. So, in other words, in my respectful submission, he's claiming to speak for himself, but in the paragraphs to which I have referred, balancing the various factors, he had regard to all of these which had a bearing on the overall fairness of the trial and insofar as he refers to Hogg v Clark, in the context of determining the significance of one, of the supposedly unfair features, the non-disclosure of certain information in my respectful submission, no conclusion at all that can be drawn at this point in the opinion, that the proceedings were unfair solely on account of that one factor, and it has to be put into the context of what he said before and what he said later. And it was only when taking all of the matters together -- and he again at Paragraph 85 repeats"
p2,00:33:55.230,00:33:55.800,spk_3,that
p2,00:33:56.430,00:35:44.540,spk_2,"by saying, Taking all the relevant factors together, I have reached the conclusion that in this case, the failures of The Lord Advocate's Representative to disclose information to the defence and the advocate deputy's reliance on the dock identifications of Gilchrist and Simpson were incompatible with the appellant's core Article 6 Convention Rights, taking together, they resulted in an unfair trial. So as I understand that a proper analysis of what His Lordship said, he makes it plain that it was the cumulative effect of all the factors taken together that led to the conclusion that the trial was not fair. And what I would invite this court to do is to come to the view, for purposes of clarity, for those who seek to seize upon that particular passage to which I have referred, is to come to the conclusion that His Lordship was not stipulating that the Hogg v Clark test should be used in order to determine whether there had been a miscarriage of justice or unfair trial. Rather what he was attempting to do, correctly in my respectful submission, was considering whether the non-disclosure of the outstanding charges was so unlikely to have been a practical effect that it could be left out of account all together, as opposed to whether it forms part of a cumulative evaluation. So, My Lords, in terms of My Lord and the chair's question about how this matter has come to pass, it has come to pass as a result of that particular remark by His Lordship in the paragraph to which I have referred being taken entirely out of context and applied to grounds of appeal, in particular additional evidence appeals, before the Criminal Appeal Court in Scotland."
p2,00:35:44.550,00:36:15.710,spk_0,"Now, you just used that phrase which I was going to ask you about, you used it earlier -- additional evidence appeals. Am I right then in understanding that, in practise, the Appeal Court looks on these cases of non-disclosure when one sees evidence that should have been available for use in the same way as they have traditionally dealt with additional evidence cases? We've got an example in tab 1, I think, it's the very familiar case of Cameron, and we don't need to look very far than just holding at the very beginning."

p2,00:38:05.030,00:38:34.430,spk_0,"Yes, well, that brings me to the point I was really trying to get at, which is assume that one has got over subsection 3(A), and the court is then feels itself entitled to look at the evidence, then the question is what test does it apply there? And is it sensible to think that there should be a different test where the fresh evidence is really evidence that was not disclosed, as opposed to evidence that was simply not available because it was undiscoverable at the time of the trial?"
p2,00:38:34.470,00:39:07.090,spk_2,"Yes, and it is correct to say that they shouldn't be treated differently, because otherwise one would have one test before the Court of Appeal in relation to issues of non-disclosed material and, at the same time, a different test for material that comes to light after the trial, pointing towards someone's innocence that wasn't in the Crown's possession pre trial.

Plainly, the court will require to be satisfied, not merely that the additional evidence was relevant for consideration by the jury, Setting aside the verdict of the jury is no life matter before the court can hold there has been a miscarriage of justice it will, under reference to the language of Section 228, require to be satisfied that the additional evidence is not merely evidence that should have been relevant to lied at the trial, But that it is relevant evidence of such significance that it will be reasonable to conclude that the verdict of the jury reached in ignorance of its existence must be regarded as a miscarriage of justice, The decision on the issue of the significance of the additional evidence is for the Appeal Court and before the court will be in a position to decide that the verdict of the jury represents a miscarriage of justice it will require to be satisfied that the additional evidence is important evidence of such a kind and quality that it was likely to have been found by a reasonable jury under proper direction of material assistance in their consideration of a critical issue which emerged at the trial."

And, My Lords, in my respectful submission, when one is looking at non-disclosed material by the Crown it is entirely appropriate that the court and look at that material as if it's dealing with fresh evidence appeals."
p2,00:47:01.040,00:47:44.130,spk_0,"Well I'm just wondering whether that is really right. As Lord Brown was pointing out, the starting point of this particular chapter of that part of the criminal jurisprudence is a violation of Article 6, and the requirement that it should be a fair trial. And if there's a real risk of prejudice, going back to the phraseology we were using before, one can understand that, maybe it's muddling it up too much to get involved in the Cameron test and so on where you've got to get through a different hoop to get there, and it's the appellant himself who is trying to adduce fresh evidence, not complaining of a non-disclosure, I'm just not certain about it."
p2,00:47:44.140,00:48:02.460,spk_2,"There are a number of cases that come before the Appeals Court in Scotland, which are cases which involve non-disclosure. Some are presented as fresh evidence cases, and some are simply presented to the court that it was a breach of Article 6. And so they come before the court by different routes."
p2,00:48:02.460,00:48:19.940,spk_0,"It could be for different purposes. Fresh evidence would be straightforward evidence that you would want to have led, a non-disclosure case such as the present is one which is really concerned with additional ammunition for cross-examining a Crown witness. These may lead to different conclusions."

p2,00:51:43.180,00:51:44.730,spk_0,that's the Pendleton test.

p2,00:51:46.810,00:51:47.750,spk_1,for some sort of consistency across the border [laughter].
p2,00:51:47.750,00:52:02.480,spk_2,"Well, of course, I'll be inviting the court not to come to the view that consistency across the border is necessarily useful or appropriate, but certainly I take My Lords"
p2,00:52:02.700,00:52:03.870,spk_3,point
p2,00:52:03.880,00:54:40.530,spk_2,"that in all of the jurisprudence in a number of different jurisdictions, that generally is the kind of approach that's taken in American jurisprudence, it's a reasonable prospect of a different result, for example. And is also consistent with the approach taken to fresh evidence in England and Wales, where the Court of Appeal considers whether the evidence given a trial might reasonably have affected the jury's decision to convict. So I take entirely Lord Brown's point in relation to that. The formulation of the various words used effectively amount to the same thing, that there has been prejudice caused to the appellant in his trial that might reasonably have affected a jury's decision to convict him. And, frankly, if the court in Scotland will keep the matter simple and consistent, it would be of use to everybody, including this particular court and, in my respectful submission, eventually alighting upon the world's, real risk of prejudice is a perfectly sensible and practical way of remedying any defect that has occurred in the original trial. My Lords I don't wish to take the matter any further unless My Lord's wish me to. But I would invite them, respectfully, in relation to what Lord Rodger has said, if issuing any judgement in this case, to make it clear that that those remarks to which we've been discussing have been taken out of context and should not be in future cases, and that may be of assistance both to counsel drafting grounds of appeal, and to the Court of Appeal. I would also invite them to come to the conclusion that the test alighted upon by the Appeal Court, namely real risk of prejudice, was entirely appropriate and was compliant with Article 6, and I would also invite them to come to the conclusion that in applying that test, they did so correctly, providing cogent reasons for their decision and that they were entitled to reach the conclusions that they did upon that material. And, My Lord's have heard what I have to say about issues relating to fresh evidence appeals, and how there can be a consistency between the various tests, all be it expressed somewhat differently in their terms, and on that basis, we to come to the conclusion the appeal has currently set out and argued today"

p2,00:54:54.720,00:55:55.840,spk_4,"I should say I was initially tempted to critique, to a degree, the observations made on behalf of the respondent, in the respondents case dealing with the role of the Supreme Court that seemed to suggest that the Supreme Court, in its approach might equiparate, might be equiparated to that of the European Court of Human Rights, I'm assured by the Land Advocate depute, that those observations in Paragraph 6 and 7 of the case are specific to -- were to be specific to this case and he has not relied on in this case. Therefore, my sense of, the sense of being tempted to critique has perhaps flown away, and in the light of the excuse, in the light of the approach adopted in Alison this morning, the exchange between My Lords and the Advocate depute indicating the role of the Supreme Court perhaps is wholly unnecessary."
p2,00:55:55.850,00:56:15.820,spk_0,"Could you just help me to understand what you just said about Paragraph 6 in particular of the respondents case, when we are asked to follow a similar approach to Edwards, we're asked to consider the proceedings as a whole, including the appeal process. Are you are you disputing that?"
p2,00:56:15.890,00:57:20.580,spk_4,"My Lord no. It's where it continues to, It should consider whether the procedure for the report of the High Court of Judiciary, remedied any unfairness at the trial stage, In so doing, it needs not to make its own assessment of the facts or the evidence that is being matters primarily for the Scottish courts. Now in relation to that last point, and, it can, of course, be open to My Lords to make an assessment of the facts if they are so minded to do in the interests of justice. And that is really the point that I raised in relation to Alison, and which formed part of the exchange between the Lords and the Advocate depute in Alison. There seems to be some suggestion there that the Supreme Court is limited in its jurisdiction when matters come before it, and that, in a sense, the facts are to be left only for consideration by the Scottish court. Now I do not understand that to be the proposition that has been advanced as a generality."
p2,00:57:20.770,00:58:09.080,spk_3,"You're saying, in other words, that if one came across, I'm not suggesting it would ever such a thing would happen, but if one came across a case where the Appeal Court had purported to apply an appropriate test but had gone about it in such a way as to abuse it in a sense, and therefore, although nominally if it was applied correctly, it would remedy the whole situation, there could be a situation where if it had failed to appreciate to do a proper and had done a perverse appreciation of the facts, in that situation, even though they are purported to apply the correct tests and all that something which, if applied correctly, would have led to the thing being remedied, in that situation, this court could indeed interfere, you would?"
p2,00:58:10.430,00:58:12.320,spk_4,"Precisely so, My Lord, Inevitably --"
p2,00:58:12.940,00:58:50.760,spk_0,"The context of that will always be a devolution issue won't it, and I suppose the basis for your argument if one takes it all the way back to base is that this court is under a duty, as any other court is, to apply Article 6 so that in the resolution of the devolution issue, we have to be satisfied that there has been a fair trial, and its part of our function to provide that if we thought that that that hadn't been achieved, Would that be right? Precisely so My Lord, precisely so -- So you're not really suggesting that particular problem is arising here are you?"
p2,00:58:50.930,01:00:13.910,spk_4,"My Lord, no, it's just if this passage were intended to be offered as a generality, it has been clarified to the land advocate depute that it is not offered as that . So that is why I don't go further in that, the only other point I would make is really by way of comment. Again as the learned Advocate Depute has set out, there is a real need for clarity in the, particularly the area of disclosure, because of the approach which is taken to the speeches of My Lords, in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases, that they're approached on, apparently, a conveyancing analysis, which leads to if not confusion at least to considerable fine arguments made frequently before the courts, in which, no doubt, will end up in certain guises before My Lords. So that is why I allow myself, with the learned advocate depute, in the desire for clarity -- I should offer one observation that where words like robust are used, the they will be provided with a meaning by the way in which they are assessed, and it will be somehow seem to mean something firmer or stronger than materiality. There is, plainly, again, a risk that that will happen."
p2,01:00:13.910,01:00:15.990,spk_0,"You don't want us to use the word robust, you mean?"
p2,01:00:16.000,01:00:43.350,spk_4,"It would be a plea My Lords, My Lords, the word robust is used by my ministerial colleagues day and day, and I can then understand why maybe said it has no meaning in certain matters, but it will, as a matter of law, doubtless be seen to in some way elevate a test in someway. So that would be a plea My Lord, rather than an argument. My Lords, I have nothing further to add."
p2,01:00:44.760,01:00:48.000,spk_0,"Thank you very much indeed, Mr Carroll?"
p2,01:00:48.240,01:02:16.710,spk_1,"Very briefly, My Lords, in case there's any doubt about my position on this matter, the learned advocate depute said that I made a concession that the court identified and then applied the correct test. What I did say, and I've checked the notes with my colleague, is that I conceded they certainly identified the test, but I said they misapplied it. So in effect is, I suppose, the metaphor is having the correct horse but putting the wrong rider on its back, and as a result of that, it effectively neutralised the whole process. The second point, My Lords, very briefly, is I do not submit or accept that examining fresh evidence appeals in terms of The Criminal Procedure Act Scotland 1995 offers a great deal of assistance because, in relation to non-disclosure, for example, I think My Lord Brown I identified the point, perhaps, is also, and My Lord in the chair identified the point, I think it was, that a fresh evidence case is looking at something that was never before the court, whereas in a case such as this, where it's withheld evidence, it could in fact be more of the same, but the sort of material that could tip the balance where, for example, one witness says another witness is incorrect. But if there's a battery of witnesses who are not disclosed, say that witness was incorrect, that's not fresh evidence as such. It's quite a different, it's a different animal. So those are the only points I wish to raise with My Lord, My Lords."

My Lords, I appear together with my learned friend, Miss, Mrs [inaudible] and Miss Mitchell, the co-appellants represented by my learned friend Mr Brown, assisted by Mr Devlin. The Advocate General appears together with my learned friends Mr Muir, the advocate general."

p3,00:02:24.930,00:02:29.360,spk_3,"I'm sorry My Lords. The Advocate Depute and the Advocate General appears on his own together with my learned friend, Mr Lindsay."
p3,00:02:29.840,00:02:47.060,spk_2,"Now, we have a list of hours which seems to exceed by some margin the time available. But I take it that the Advocate Depute and the Advocate General's two hours are not to be added together. You take two hours, is that right, to reply to the?"
p3,00:02:48.640,00:02:50.400,spk_3,"[Inaudible] Yes, that is correct."

p3,00:02:53.340,00:02:53.740,spk_3,[inaudible].
p3,00:02:54.340,00:03:05.090,spk_2,"All right. And that would be in toto for both cases, really, taking them as one effectively? And Advocate Depute is that your position too?"
p3,00:03:05.100,00:03:06.050,spk_4,I would
p3,00:03:06.640,00:03:08.580,spk_2,anticipate being something of that
p3,00:03:08.580,00:03:10.820,spk_0,order myself for the two
p3,00:03:10.820,00:03:28.210,spk_2,"appeals. Yes. And would it be convenient if we, I don't know how the division is between you, Mr Shed, and Mr Brown, but it would seem better that you both address us first, and then we proceed to the law officers. Is that what parties were anticipating? Yes."
p3,00:03:28.210,00:03:29.380,spk_3,"It was, as I understand it, My Lord, yes."
p3,00:03:29.400,00:03:30.650,spk_2,Yes. Good. Very well
p3,00:03:31.420,00:03:35.080,spk_0,is there any difference at all between the two cases? I haven't detected it.
p3,00:03:35.090,00:03:38.460,spk_3,"I don't believe so, My Lord. No. No material difference."
p3,00:03:38.460,00:03:40.280,spk_0,So why are we going to hear both of
p3,00:03:40.280,00:03:41.650,spk_1,you?
p3,00:03:42.040,00:03:50.710,spk_3,"Well, I suppose would be a matter for Your Lordships to consider how best the procedure should be regulated. It's in deference to My Lord and the Chair's indication, I think."
p3,00:03:50.720,00:03:54.290,spk_2,"Well, I was hoping we wouldn't take five hours for the pair of you, I would hope we could--"
p3,00:03:54.300,00:04:22.260,spk_3,"No, My Lord, I'm slightly perturbed to hear My Lord indicate the position in relation to the proposed timings. In fairness to parties, My Lord, I think it was thought that the timings might be worked out on the basis that the appeal might start at two o'clock today and tomorrow would be available if necessary. I see. And I think that as I had done the arithmetic My Lord, those timings were to fit within this afternoon and tomorrow. I see. But it may be that Your Lordships have received a message which suggests a rather more alarming vista."
p3,00:04:22.740,00:04:35.060,spk_2,"Well, let's proceed in that way. What we'll do is we'll hear you, and then Mr Brown can add anything he would like to add and then we'll proceed to the Advocate Depute and then to the Advocate General."
p3,00:04:35.840,00:04:36.010,spk_3,I
p3,00:04:36.010,00:04:37.620,spk_0,"must share, this is a cavernous"
p3,00:04:37.620,00:04:38.870,spk_2,"space. Yes, My Lord."
p3,00:04:38.880,00:04:45.450,spk_0,"So you really have to raise your voice, because it's no good pretending that the loudspeaker system works, it doesn't."
p3,00:04:47.540,00:04:49.740,spk_3,"I'll do my best to assist then, My Lords, if I"
p3,00:04:49.740,00:04:50.060,spk_1,may.
p3,00:04:51.340,00:05:43.630,spk_3,"As Your Lordships will be aware, the issue in the appeal is whether Section 45 of the Criminal Proceedings etc. Reform Scotland Act 2007, in so far as it increases or purports to increase the maximum sentence on summary conviction for a contravention of Section 103(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act in 1988, as amended, is within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. And My Lords, I think we'll see the issue set out in the statement of facts and issues which My Lords will find, I hope in the bound volume at tab 2. Yes. Lords, if I could say just a very little about the immediate background to Mr Martin's case before inviting Your Lordships' attention to the terms of the Scotland Act. My Lords, before the passing of the 2007 Act, the relevant"
p3,00:05:43.640,00:05:45.040,spk_0,penalty was
p3,00:05:45.040,00:06:10.760,spk_3,"provided for by Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, and My Lords will again find reference to that in the bound volume at tab 2 at page 5, and at summary level, the penalty was six months. So the practical territory that the appeal crosses, My Lords, is the difference between the penalties that stood six months and the penalty as it now purportedly is 12 months."
p3,00:06:10.770,00:06:18.140,spk_2,"It was an either or type of offence, wasn't it, in the sense that it could be prosecuted either summarily or on indictment?"
p3,00:06:18.150,00:06:37.340,spk_3,"Absolutely My Lord. There was specific provision, in respect of Scotland, for the offence being tried either way, though I understand from the helpful research as undertaken by the Lord Advocate that there's an indication in the papers that the position was not so in England. But in any event, as My Lord and the Chair points out, so far as Scotland was concerned, that was absolutely the position. Right."
p3,00:06:37.940,00:06:40.850,spk_1,So it couldn't be at prosecution and indictment?
p3,00:06:41.540,00:07:10.690,spk_3,"That's my understanding My Lord. So My Lords will know the facts so far as relevant, very briefly stated, are the appellant pled guilty to two charges of driving while disqualified. Those were committed in December 2007, and in respect of those charges he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. The charges were committed while he was on bail, and so he received a sentence of eight months in respect of the substantive offences and four months in respect to the bail aggravation."
p3,00:07:12.640,00:07:14.460,spk_2,Yes. His
p3,00:07:14.460,00:07:32.830,spk_3,"bill of suspension laws was dismissed by the High Court of Justiciary on the sixth of January of this year. No argument haven't been heard. My Lords will be aware from the papers that there had been an earlier case as heard in the summer last year by the High Court Justiciary, which raised similar points. At that stage My Lords it was perhaps anticipated"
p3,00:07:32.840,00:07:33.470,spk_1,that the
p3,00:07:33.480,00:07:37.410,spk_3,present appellants would be heard at the same time. But for practical reasons that didn't occur.
p3,00:07:37.740,00:07:46.400,spk_2,"And just so, quite clear, a bill of suspension as a means of bringing under review of the High Court decisions of the Sheriff Court?"
p3,00:07:46.410,00:07:59.930,spk_3,"Absolutely My Lord. And it's classically regarded, if it's of assistance to the court, as being deployed in this context where there's a challenge to the competence of the sentence. Yeah. And that's why it's the vehicle which has been adopted by both appellants in"
p3,00:07:59.930,00:08:01.640,spk_1,this court.
p3,00:08:02.440,00:08:03.950,spk_0,[Inaudible].
p3,00:08:05.140,00:08:27.940,spk_3,"Now, My Lords, it is, as I understand it, a matter of agreement that the road traffic legislation is a reserved matter within the meaning of Part 2 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act, and that the appellant was subject to the enhanced penalty under Section 45 of the 2007 Act, at the material time."
p3,00:08:28.440,00:08:31.540,spk_1,
p3,00:08:36.440,00:08:39.830,spk_3,"Now My Lords,"
p3,00:08:39.830,00:08:48.620,spk_0,"therefore the-- Did you start serving your disqualification, or sorry, no what, did you go to prison [inaudible]?"
p3,00:08:48.670,00:08:58.140,spk_3,"Yes, My Lord. And he has served some time in that sentence being admitted to interim liberation, I think in March, I'll have the precise date checked My Lord if I could. He served -- why"
p3,00:08:58.140,00:09:05.560,spk_0,"was he released? After we gave leave wasn't he, or after leave was given?"
p3,00:09:06.540,00:09:21.190,spk_3,"No. I'll need to check the precise timing My Lord, if I may, just to come back to My Lord about that matter. It's not uncommon, My Lord, when an issue of competence about the sentence is raised for the High Court to consider admitting someone to bail pending the determination of their bill of suspension."
p3,00:09:21.200,00:09:23.050,spk_2,So did the High Court make an order?
p3,00:09:23.340,00:09:23.880,spk_3,Yes.
p3,00:09:23.890,00:09:28.910,spk_2,"Somebody applied for it. Presumably your client applied for that, who was given it during --"
p3,00:09:28.910,00:09:35.100,spk_3,"yeah, absolutely My Lord. The appellant has to apply for for interim liberation pending the disposal of the bill. And that occurred in this case My Lord."
p3,00:09:35.100,00:09:38.200,spk_0,I mean you were sentenced from the 17th of December 07.
p3,00:09:38.270,00:09:39.010,spk_3,"Yes, My Lord."
p3,00:09:40.140,00:09:45.020,spk_0,But you didn't get leave even until January '09. Is this it?
p3,00:09:45.030,00:10:03.160,spk_3,"Absolutely, My Lord, that that was a practical reason effectively connected with the hearings and the other cases in July last year, but to answer My Lord's question about the date of interim liberation, Mr. Martin was granted interim liberation in the 28th of March 2008."
p3,00:10:03.840,00:10:06.940,spk_0,"He, sorry, he was bailed on the 20th of March '08?"
p3,00:10:06.950,00:10:12.060,spk_3,"28th, My Lord, of March 2008."
p3,00:10:14.040,00:10:17.820,spk_0,"Oh, sorry. Yes, that's called interim liberation. Is that it?"
p3,00:10:17.830,00:10:19.030,spk_3,"Yes, My Lord. I see,"
p3,00:10:19.030,00:10:19.260,spk_1,okay.
p3,00:10:20.140,00:10:30.380,spk_3,"It's not uncommon as a generality, My Lord, for those who use this mode of appeal to apply for interim liberation pending the court considering the merits of the bill. I see."
p3,00:10:30.390,00:10:48.760,spk_2,"And it sounds, the sequence of events would be that interim liberation would be granted, a date fixed for the hearing of the bill of suspension, and then you've explained what happened then and the order was not recalled because it was indicated that the matter would come before this court?"
p3,00:10:49.140,00:11:32.050,spk_3,"My Lord, when the bill called for, before the High Court Justiciary in January 2009, the bill was dismissed, but at that stage the Crown did not seek a warrant for his reimprisonment, which would, as My Lord and the Chair certainly, and Lord Rodger, would bear in mind was a common enough practice, but on that occasion, the Crown did not do so, as My Lords know, there was subsequently a hearing for seeking what was then leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council before the High Court Justiciary. And as My Lords know this was then granted. And against that background, very helpful and very properly, the Advocate Depute did not move for the recall of interim liberation since the matter was coming before Your Lordships."
p3,00:11:33.340,00:11:34.440,spk_2,"Yes, thank you. You"
p3,00:11:34.440,00:11:36.130,spk_1,didn't appeal against the sentence as such?
p3,00:11:37.040,00:11:40.240,spk_3,Not as such My Lord. The bill of suspension is directed to this issue alone.
p3,00:11:40.260,00:11:42.140,spk_2,So it's entirely competency.
p3,00:11:43.100,00:11:56.960,spk_3,"Indeed so My Lord. Though perhaps since Your Lordships are raising these questions, I might indicate my understanding is the Sheriff reduced the sentence in recognition of the fact there was an early plea of guilty."
p3,00:11:57.440,00:11:58.830,spk_1,Reduced it because of what?
p3,00:11:58.840,00:12:01.190,spk_3,"The fact that there was a plea of guilty, My Lord, in this case."
p3,00:12:01.200,00:12:02.080,spk_1,"Yes, yes."
p3,00:12:07.440,00:12:07.950,spk_2,Yes.
p3,00:12:09.640,00:12:09.960,spk_0,My
p3,00:12:11.040,00:12:40.560,spk_3,"Lords, the, perhaps the most important provisions of the Scotland Act for present purposes, if I may respectfully suggest, Your Lordships, are Section 29, Section 101 and 126 and Schedules 4 and 5, particularly Parts 2, paragraph's 2 and 3 of Schedule 4 and Part 2 of Schedule 5. My Lords, I understand that those provisions at least have been reproduced for Your Lordships' benefit in volume 9, tab 107 of the volumes."

p3,00:14:12.540,00:14:41.820,spk_3,"My Lords will see that Subsection 1 provides that an Act of the Scottish Parliament is not law so far as any provision of the Act is outside the legislative competence of the parliament. And then Subsection 2 provides very broadly the circumstances in which a provision might be said to be outside that competence.

p3,00:15:22.870,00:15:49.060,spk_3,"Absolutely My Lord. I'm very much obliged, the Subsection 3 appears to be pointing Your Lordships' attention to how the question of whether a provision relates to reserve matter should be adjudicated, and My Lords will see for the purposes of this section, that is Section 29, the question whether provisions of an Act of the Scottish Parliament relates to reserve matter is to be determined, subject to Subsection 4, by reference to the purpose of the provision,"
p3,00:15:49.070,00:15:50.900,spk_0,"having, among"

p3,00:15:54.890,00:16:00.060,spk_2,"And then Subsection 4, which may be thought to cast further light on what is meant by B?"
p3,00:16:00.440,00:16:23.760,spk_3,"Absolutely My Lord, it provides a provision which would A. otherwise would make, would otherwise not relate to reserve matters, but B makes modifications of Scots private or Scots criminal law, as it applies to reserve matters, is to be treated as relating to reserve matters, unless the purpose of the provision is to make the law in question apply consistently to reserve matters and otherwise."

p3,00:16:27.370,00:16:37.160,spk_3,"of course, My Lords, is the structure of the section. My Lords will also be aware that relevant, therefore, for present purposes, are the provision of Scheduled 4 to the Act."

p3,00:20:16.740,00:20:20.270,spk_0,"Yes, My Lord. Sorry, Schedule 5, what?"
p3,00:20:22.140,00:20:30.220,spk_1,"Page 83 on the print out. Section E(1)(d). The Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. Yes,"
p3,00:20:30.220,00:20:35.550,spk_3,"I'm most obliged, My Lord, thank you. If it's any assistance, My Lords, I don't understand this point generally to be controversial."
p3,00:20:36.220,00:20:38.500,spk_0,Well we might as well -- just
p3,00:20:38.500,00:20:40.170,spk_1,identify where we're going.
p3,00:20:40.180,00:20:40.770,spk_0,Absolutely.
p3,00:20:41.840,00:20:45.010,spk_2,Should we go back to Schedule

p3,00:20:46.060,00:20:49.670,spk_2,"Paragraph 2, subparagraph 3."
p3,00:20:50.040,00:20:53.670,spk_3,"Yes. My Lords, if I can take My Lords therefore to that,"
p3,00:20:55.140,00:21:09.170,spk_0,"I'm terribly sorry, just, the subject matter of is page 83. How do we get into this subject? Where's the lead in to to page 83? I mean."
p3,00:21:10.040,00:21:10.230,spk_1,My
p3,00:21:10.230,00:21:12.880,spk_3,"Lord, we see that page 83 --"
p3,00:21:13.350,00:21:25.080,spk_0,"No, I do see that there is a heading, and it says the subject matter of D and then our 2 1988 Acts, but, I mean, I don't quite know"
p3,00:21:25.080,00:21:35.850,spk_1,"what -- Section 30 is the one which gives rise to the Schedule. Yes. Section 30, Subsection 1 defines reserved matters. Oh,"
p3,00:21:36.350,00:21:38.550,spk_0,that's it. So it's Section 31.
p3,00:21:38.940,00:21:39.920,spk_1,"30, Subsection 1, yeah."
p3,00:21:40.740,00:21:58.880,spk_0,"30, Subsection 1. Schedule 5 [pause]. By the time you get"
p3,00:21:58.880,00:21:59.380,spk_1,to
p3,00:21:59.970,00:22:03.440,spk_0,"E1, what is it E1 of? I mean, where's the lead in?"
p3,00:22:04.240,00:22:05.160,spk_2,To specific
p3,00:22:05.160,00:22:06.780,spk_0,"reservations, is this is it?"
p3,00:22:07.740,00:22:14.360,spk_3,"Lord, E(1), if I can assist in any way, My Lord, is part of Schedule 5, which deals specifically with the reserved matters as My Lord Rodger of Earlsferry has"
p3,00:22:14.360,00:22:15.170,spk_0,pointed out -- I know.
p3,00:22:15.640,00:22:16.450,spk_3,How
p3,00:22:16.450,00:22:18.460,spk_0,do you get to E1?
p3,00:22:18.940,00:22:19.930,spk_2,"Well, that's specific"
p3,00:22:19.930,00:22:23.920,spk_1,"reservations, Part 2. What? Specific reservations, Part 2."
p3,00:22:23.930,00:22:25.560,spk_0,Part 2? Yeah.
p3,00:22:27.540,00:22:28.400,spk_2,Of the Schedule.
p3,00:22:28.540,00:22:34.480,spk_3,"It's page 76, My Lord, I think it's Part 2, specific reservations and then they're enumerated under various heads."
p3,00:22:34.940,00:22:45.660,spk_2,"Yes, it's, paragraph 1 says that matters to which any of the section's in this part apply are reserved matters for the purposes of the Act. We need that, don't you? Yes."
p3,00:22:47.040,00:22:48.770,spk_3,Yeah.
p3,00:22:49.240,00:22:49.450,spk_1,
p3,00:22:50.740,00:23:22.160,spk_2,"And the next one, paragraph 2, a section applies to any matter described or referred to in it when read with any illustrations, exceptions and so on and so forth. But we're really concerned with paragraph 1, and all of this takes us back to what, 292(b) is dealing with when it says relates to reserve matters. Absolutely. You need to know what that is. Yes indeed. But before we leave Schedule 5, should we just bear in mind 2, Subparagraph 3?"
p3,00:23:24.040,00:23:25.360,spk_1,
p3,00:23:26.140,00:23:38.980,spk_2,"Because I think that is in play. Yes, indeed My Lord. This is Schedule 5, page 71, paragraph 2, Subparagraph 3?"
p3,00:23:40.740,00:23:45.460,spk_3,"Yes, indeed My Lord. And if I could just remind My Lords therefore, that"
p3,00:23:45.510,00:23:46.390,spk_0,paragraph
p3,00:23:46.390,00:24:02.310,spk_3,"1 applies in relation to a rule of Scots private or Scots criminal law, whether or not contained in an enactment, only to the extent that the rule is special to reserve matter, and the other aspect of the matter is not immediately relevant for present purposes."
p3,00:24:02.530,00:24:13.000,spk_2,"That falls to be read, I think, with the definition of Scots criminal law on page 61 which is in the Section"
p3,00:24:13.010,00:24:14.220,spk_0,"126,"
p3,00:24:14.220,00:24:25.430,spk_2,"Subsection 5, which I think explains that Scots criminal law includes, amongst other things, penalties. Indeed. Which is what you're concerned with."
p3,00:24:25.440,00:24:36.160,spk_3,"Absolutely. My Lords will see that's not an exhaustive definition in 126 Subsection 5, but it certainly sets out a number of specific matters, which include penalties."
p3,00:24:37.040,00:24:39.730,spk_1,"If one looks at, Section 29"
p3,00:24:39.820,00:24:40.160,spk_0,"(2),"
p3,00:24:40.640,00:25:05.160,spk_1,"I'm just trying to get my bearings on it, because one is aware of the complications of this subject, do I take it that something is out of competence if it relates to reserve matter, but it's also out of competence, even if it doesn't relate to reserve matters, if it is in breach of the restrictions in Schedule"
p3,00:25:05.160,00:25:06.190,spk_3,"4? Precisely, My Lord."
p3,00:25:06.300,00:25:18.190,spk_1,"So it's not enough, so to speak, that you escape from B. You've also got to escape from C. Is that right? From the point of view of the legislature?"
p3,00:25:18.290,00:25:22.240,spk_3,Absolutely My Lord. And then that's the submission I make on the appellant's behalf.
p3,00:25:22.250,00:25:29.060,spk_2,"So a lot turns, I would suggest, on what is really meant by relates to in Section 29,"
p3,00:25:29.440,00:25:30.230,spk_0,2
p3,00:25:30.240,00:25:38.600,spk_2,"(b), because if I understand the system correctly, if you are able to get within 2(b), then you're home and dry, aren't"
p3,00:25:38.600,00:25:39.240,spk_3,"you? Yes, indeed, My Lord."
p3,00:25:39.470,00:25:49.740,spk_2,"But it may be said indeed, said against you, it doesn't actually relate to reserve matters, and therefore you have to try to find a solution in little C which takes you to the Schedule."
p3,00:25:49.750,00:26:02.940,spk_3,"Yes, indeed My Lord. So, My Lord, I wonder, if I just could, My Lord, before I seek to address that, if I, on behalf of the appellant, if I could also just mention to Your Lordships so far as Schedule 4 is concerned, before Your Lordships, as it"
p3,00:26:02.940,00:26:04.180,spk_0,"were, leave"
p3,00:26:04.180,00:26:05.380,spk_3,it for the time

p3,00:26:06.180,00:26:14.960,spk_3,"that as well as the Subparagraph of paragraph 2, read to Your Lordships, there's also paragraph 3"
p3,00:26:15.440,00:26:15.670,spk_1,-
p3,00:26:16.140,00:26:27.410,spk_3,which may be relevant. And My Lords will see that the paragraph 2 does not apply to modifications which are incidental to or consequential on --
p3,00:26:27.440,00:26:28.000,spk_2,Yes.
p3,00:26:28.740,00:26:57.400,spk_3,"Provision made. And My Lords will see, the first aspect in A is incidental to or consequential upon provision made which does not relate to reserve matters. And (b), do not have a greater effect on reserve matters than is necessary to give effect to the purpose of the provision. And if I could just also mention to Your Lordships, My Lord and the Chair has already alluded to Section 126, which"
p3,00:26:57.400,00:26:57.800,spk_0,is the
p3,00:26:58.250,00:26:59.660,spk_3,interpretation section.
p3,00:27:00.840,00:27:01.330,spk_0,I will
p3,00:27:01.340,00:27:06.060,spk_3,"just draw attention My Lords, if I may, to the fact that on page 60 My Lords will see that"
p3,00:27:06.070,00:27:07.200,spk_0,enactment
p3,00:27:07.210,00:27:12.310,spk_3,includes an Act of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland legislation in the meaning of the 1998

p3,00:27:13.140,00:27:24.580,spk_3,"and an enactment comprised in subordinate legislation, and includes an enactment comprised in or in subordinate legislation under an Act of Parliament, whenever passed or made. My Lords will also see --"
p3,00:27:24.820,00:27:27.560,spk_0,Have we got any subordinate legislation in play here?
p3,00:27:28.340,00:27:40.670,spk_3,"Well, it depends on one's view as I understand it. One view of the matter, My Lord, is that all the provisions, in particular, Section 45, is subordinate legislation, even though made by the Scottish Parliament."
p3,00:27:43.040,00:27:48.320,spk_4,"Well, that hardly squares with the definition of subordinate legislation at the top of page 61,"
p3,00:27:48.330,00:27:48.770,spk_1,does it?
p3,00:27:49.340,00:27:57.670,spk_3,"No, I appreciate that, My Lord. Certainly, from the perspective of the Human Rights Act, Acts of the Scottish Parliament are defined as subordinate legislation."
p3,00:27:58.940,00:28:02.050,spk_1,"Yeah. Yes, they are."
p3,00:28:02.440,00:28:02.760,spk_3,Yes.
p3,00:28:03.630,00:28:04.320,spk_1,"Yes,"
p3,00:28:04.740,00:28:10.640,spk_3,"for the purpose of that Act, My Lord, and appreciate Your Lordships required to be guided by what is said here."
p3,00:28:10.740,00:28:11.540,spk_0,If I could
p3,00:28:11.550,00:28:25.980,spk_3,"also mention to My Lords, for what it's worth, the word modified also appears in, modify, I should say, appears in the interpretation section and that, as My Lords will see, includes amend or repeal."
p3,00:28:26.940,00:28:29.130,spk_0,
p3,00:28:29.140,00:28:41.660,spk_3,And My Lord Walker has already called attention to the specific definition of subordinate legislation at the top of page 61. And My Lord in the Chair has noticed Subsection
p3,00:28:42.540,00:28:43.670,spk_0,5.
p3,00:28:50.240,00:29:08.560,spk_2,"Are you able to direct me to the provision in Schedule 2 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, which I think is printed in full in volume 8, tab 104, so we can actually see the layout of the provision we're dealing with? Yes, indeed."

p3,00:29:19.750,00:29:20.560,spk_2,[Inaudible].
p3,00:29:21.340,00:29:22.990,spk_0,[Inaudible].
p3,00:29:24.640,00:29:41.630,spk_3,"My Lord, if I can draw My Lords' attention to the Road Traffic Offenders Act, which as My Lord observes, is that that tab, My Lords, it's in tabular form at page 4403 of the statute."
p3,00:29:41.640,00:29:51.500,spk_2,"Yes. And so we see the Section of the Road Traffic Act itself, 103, which is a relevant section."
p3,00:29:51.520,00:29:52.210,spk_3,Yes.
p3,00:29:52.360,00:30:22.560,spk_2,"For our purpose. And there is a different system for Scotland as compared with England and Wales, in that, as I understand it, the only method of prosecution in England and Wales is summary prosecution. And then we can see in Scotland, there are the alternatives at the bottom of the page. What's effectively happened, I suppose, is that under the punishment section for six months, you now read 12 months, if the provision is competent."
p3,00:30:22.570,00:30:24.270,spk_3,"Yes, My Lord."
p3,00:30:24.280,00:30:24.860,spk_1,"It,"
p3,00:30:25.440,00:30:27.960,spk_3,"as it happens, My Lord, it's a doubling of the existing penalty."
p3,00:30:28.540,00:30:29.000,spk_2,I'm sorry?
p3,00:30:29.010,00:30:31.500,spk_3,"As it happens, it's a doubling of the existing penalty."
p3,00:30:31.620,00:30:35.770,spk_2,But not as far as the indictment is concerned. That remains untouched.
p3,00:30:35.780,00:30:36.460,spk_3,Absolutely.
p3,00:30:36.840,00:30:44.030,spk_2,"So the only change is a change from 6 in little (b), is that right, against the summary"
p3,00:30:44.030,00:30:44.770,spk_3,prosecution?
p3,00:30:46.140,00:30:50.890,spk_1,"So in Scotland, you can get 12 months for this. In England, you can't get more than six?"
p3,00:30:51.740,00:30:52.340,spk_3,Correct.
p3,00:30:52.350,00:30:59.670,spk_1,Even on the existing preamended version. Is that right?
p3,00:30:59.680,00:31:08.870,spk_3,"Yes, in the preamendment version, My Lord, one can only be prosecuted at summary level for this offence in England and Wales. And that was the penalty as provided for in the Schedule for the Road Traffic Offenders Act."
p3,00:31:09.040,00:31:11.820,spk_0,"Sorry, how much can you get in England and Wales summarily for this offence?"
p3,00:31:11.820,00:31:12.630,spk_3,Six months My Lord.
p3,00:31:13.050,00:31:13.960,spk_0,That's the maximum?
p3,00:31:14.840,00:31:15.860,spk_3,I understand so My Lord.
p3,00:31:17.440,00:31:35.350,spk_1,"I mean, is this table unlike almost every other provision, the criminal law escaped amendment since 1988. I seem to remember having a version of it, these things at hand when I was Lord Justice General, which had lots of changes in them."
p3,00:31:36.040,00:31:37.030,spk_0,The Road Traffic
p3,00:31:37.030,00:31:44.920,spk_3,"Act, My Lord, and possibly the Road Traffic Offenders Act, as I'm trying to answer My Lord's question immediately didn't undergo amendment, but so far as --"
p3,00:31:45.010,00:31:45.670,spk_1,Not at all?
p3,00:31:45.740,00:31:48.070,spk_3,But not at all so far as this is concerned as I understand. Right.
p3,00:31:48.080,00:31:52.820,spk_2,Somebody's very kindly set out in the statement of facts and issues in your case on page

p3,00:31:54.000,00:32:03.260,spk_2,"in the very table we're looking at, I think, which doesn't contain any indication of amendments on this provision anyway, It seems to be agreed. I hope it's correct."
p3,00:32:03.840,00:32:05.280,spk_0,I
p3,00:32:05.290,00:32:06.450,spk_3,"will make efforts, My Lord, to double check that."
p3,00:32:07.060,00:32:08.470,spk_1,"No, I'm sure you'll be right My Shed."
p3,00:32:08.480,00:32:12.700,spk_3,I think it is. I think it's one of the matters which is common ground in the appeal.
p3,00:32:12.710,00:32:19.140,spk_1,"The effect of this, therefore, is that in Scotland you can get 12 months summary, whereas in England you can only get six."
p3,00:32:19.150,00:32:19.770,spk_3,Yes.
p3,00:32:25.440,00:32:27.860,spk_0,
p3,00:32:28.740,00:32:31.560,spk_2,"After that introduction, where do we go next?"
p3,00:32:31.570,00:32:47.460,spk_3,"Well, I think in deference to the helpful indication My Lord and the Chair gave a moment or so ago, as My Lord says, the first, perhaps the first logical approach is to look at 29 2(b) to ask whether the provision relates to reserve matters."
p3,00:32:50.140,00:32:53.190,spk_0,
p3,00:32:53.200,00:33:17.560,spk_3,"And as Your Lordships have already noticed, Subsection 3 provides guidance on how that question should be addressed and My Lords will see again the question whether a reading short provision of the Act of the Scottish Parliament relates the reserve matter is to be determined, subject to Subsection 4 by reference to the purpose of the provision having regard, among other things, to its effect in all the circumstances."
p3,00:33:19.560,00:33:25.570,spk_4,"Sorry to interrupt, you mentioned Section 101. I'm not sure you took us to it, did you? Oh, no, I'm"
p3,00:33:25.570,00:33:27.410,spk_3,"terribly sorry, My Lord, perhaps I ought to."
p3,00:33:27.420,00:33:31.110,spk_4,"I don't know whether you want to now or not, but it was part of the programme you announced."
p3,00:33:31.360,00:33:40.020,spk_3,"Perhaps it would be convenient, My Lord, just to mention that. Obliged, My Lord, that's at page 48 of the Act, as we produced for Your Lordships."
p3,00:33:43.940,00:33:44.170,spk_2,
p3,00:33:47.050,00:34:19.260,spk_3,"And My Lords will see that Subsection 1 makes it clear the section applies to any provisions of an act of the Scottish Parliament or of a bill for such an Act and any provision of subordinate legislation made, confirmed and so on, which could be read in a way, such a way as to be outside competence. Subsection 2 provides that such a provision to be read as narrowly as is required for it to be within competence, if such a reading as possible, and to have effect accordingly. And"
p3,00:34:19.270,00:34:22.060,spk_0,is that equivalent Section 3 of the Human Rights Act?
p3,00:34:23.340,00:34:39.780,spk_3,"Not precisely, My Lord, as I understand it, because of course it deals with this particular subject matter, which Your Lordships are presently considering, as opposed to simply dealing with questions of reading legislation compatible with convention rights, which is but --"
p3,00:34:39.780,00:34:42.040,spk_2,The word narrowly doesn't appear in the Human Rights Act.
p3,00:34:42.050,00:35:14.800,spk_3,"No, indeed, My Lord. And I understand My Lord, the Chair made certain observations about that in the case of DS, which are set out in the appellant's case, which I was intending to come, My Lord, but in deference to Your Lordships, if its assistance by way of framing the discussion, it again appears to be common ground in the appeal that if the appellant's contentions are soundly based or any of them are, then Your Lordships would have to consider what effect Section 101 Subsection 2 had on Section 45."
p3,00:35:14.800,00:35:17.160,spk_0,Yeah. And you would say it
p3,00:35:17.160,00:35:22.920,spk_1,would be read in such a way as not to affect the Road Traffic Offenders Act?
p3,00:35:23.340,00:35:41.540,spk_3,"Yes, indeed My Lord, and again it's, as I understand it My Lord, it's common ground among the parties that although there, the formulations, I think, are expressed rather differently in the written cases, that Section 101 Subsection 2 could be deployed in broadly that manner, so there doesn't seem in this case, My Lord, that to be contentious."
p3,00:35:43.940,00:35:44.240,spk_0,
p3,00:35:47.740,00:36:06.340,spk_3,"So if the appellants were right in their contentions, to which I'll come, My Lords, then Your Lordships would be directed to Section 101 and then Subsection 2. And as my Lord Rodger helpfully observed so far as [inaudible] concerned, it would, on the face of it, My Lords, lead to the practical result contended for on behalf of Mr [inaudible]."
p3,00:36:08.230,00:36:09.540,spk_0,[Long pause].
p3,00:36:18.230,00:36:57.750,spk_3,"My Lords, then, if My Lords are then considering in the first instance Section 29 Subsection 3, Your Lordships are enjoined to consider whether, by reference to the purpose of the provision, whether it relates to reserve matter. And the language that Mr Lords will see in Subsection 3 makes it plain that Your Lordships, in doing so, have to have regard to its effect in all the circumstances. It seems plain that Your Lordships may have regard among, to other things which are not set out and enumerated, but in my respectful"
p3,00:36:57.920,00:36:58.700,spk_0,"submission, the"
p3,00:36:58.710,00:37:05.040,spk_3,one thing that Your Lordships must have regard to in this context is the effect in all the circumstances of the provision.
p3,00:37:06.630,00:37:16.100,spk_0,"Well, I mean, that's perhaps rather unsurprising because the effect is likely to reveal the purpose, isn't it? Subject to the law of unintended consequences?"
p3,00:37:17.630,00:37:30.370,spk_3,"Well, I see the force of that, My Lord. And it may be that other aspects of the Scotland Act are, in this context, are designed to deal more precisely with the unintended consequences that My Lord draws attention to, but --"
p3,00:37:30.370,00:37:48.340,spk_2,"And can one take account of things it doesn't affect as well as what it does? To just come out of the thicket, in a way, what I'm thinking about is what it doesn't do is increase the penalty on indictment and therefore the overall, the maximum sentence available for this offence in Scotland is not increased."
p3,00:37:49.330,00:38:05.530,spk_3,"Absolutely My Lord. And certainly My Lords are enjoined to have, to consider its effect, but in all the circumstances, and presumably that is not designed to restrict Your Lordships' consideration to the relevant, of the relevant circumstances, as they present themselves to Your Lordships."
p3,00:38:06.520,00:38:24.840,spk_0,"But can I make sure, hang on, I mean, in Scotland, pre amendment maximum 12 months, only six on the summary, but if you go on indictment, you can get punished, you can get sent down for 12 months, right? Correct, My Lord. Post amendment, still 12 months maximum,"
p3,00:38:26.120,00:38:26.400,spk_3,but
p3,00:38:26.400,00:38:27.890,spk_0,all of it can be given summary.
p3,00:38:28.320,00:38:28.870,spk_3,Correct.
p3,00:38:28.880,00:38:31.140,spk_0,Who decides whether to go on indictment?
p3,00:38:32.120,00:38:38.630,spk_3,"The prosecutor decides that My Lord. That's a matter, at least traditionally, for his or her unfettered discretion."
p3,00:38:39.480,00:38:51.450,spk_0,"I see. And post amendment, I mean, given that the entire sentence maximum is available summarily, why would you, why would the prosecutor want to go on indictment?"
p3,00:38:52.620,00:39:11.160,spk_3,"It's a very important question because, as I understand that the Lord Advocate in her printed case suggests that it is part of the overall reform, which the 2007 Act was designed to bring about to allow prosecutions to take place at summary level, which is quicker and cheaper generally than prosecution and indictment."
p3,00:39:11.180,00:39:43.940,spk_1,"You do get prosecutions. She still might wish to include a charge on, unless the practice has changed radically, the might include it in in the connection, whereas other charges on indictment, and this was just one of the ones which was on, and it might be necessary, for example, to have it for even just for evidential purposes, but you put it on an indictment in that kind of situation, and then a penalty can be imposed, 12 months is it, so it can be used in that kind of situation."
p3,00:39:44.720,00:39:46.670,spk_3,"Well, I'm obliged My Lord, I don't obviously --"
p3,00:39:46.880,00:39:50.950,spk_0,"I suppose, yes. But if you commit two offences, you'd have to go, would you, on indictment?"
p3,00:39:51.610,00:40:00.220,spk_3,"No My Lod. The present appellant whom I represent, I regret, committed two offences within a few days of each other and appeared on complaint. No,"
p3,00:40:00.220,00:40:04.630,spk_0,"but I mean therefore, if that had gone on indictment, he could have gone down for two years."
p3,00:40:05.110,00:40:06.120,spk_1,Yeah.
p3,00:40:06.610,00:40:07.140,spk_3,Two
p3,00:40:07.150,00:40:07.800,spk_1,"separate offences, yes. They might be made"
p3,00:40:09.870,00:40:10.630,spk_2,concurrent.
p3,00:40:10.640,00:40:17.480,spk_0,"So that might have been a, so that would have put him at greater risk to go on indictment."
p3,00:40:17.490,00:40:29.900,spk_3,"If that were the proper view of the sentence, My Lord, the difficulty is it might raise a technical question of Scottish sentencing procedure about whether one, if one is prosecuted with two charges of one indictment, one can be sentenced to more than 12 months."
p3,00:40:29.990,00:40:37.140,spk_0,"And there was some question in your case you were on bail or something. Yes, My Lord. But so if you were on indictment, that would increase too wouldn't it?"
p3,00:40:37.310,00:40:47.910,spk_3,"Yes, indeed My Lord, there is a separate penalty provided for for a bail aggravation. So if an offence is committed while on bail, one can be exposed to a significant additional penalty for that matter alone."
p3,00:40:48.080,00:40:52.230,spk_2,Does that depend on whether you're being prosecuted summarily or on indictment?
p3,00:40:53.110,00:40:59.530,spk_3,"No My Lord, one can receive a separate penalty in respect of prosecution, on indictment or on complaint."
p3,00:40:59.910,00:41:08.150,spk_2,"What I'm wondering is that there's a maximum set for for that particular offence, and does it remain the same with whatever level you're being prosecuted?"
p3,00:41:08.150,00:41:22.450,spk_3,"I think, My Lord, I'll need to double check whether there's a variation really, so far as a summary and solemn prosecutions are concerned in respect to bail aggravations. They're all regulated by the same section of the Criminal Procedure Scotland Act 1995 now, as I recollect it."
p3,00:41:23.020,00:41:30.240,spk_5,Was there any pattern of electing to prosecute an indictment in order to obtain access to the enhanced penalty?
p3,00:41:31.810,00:42:01.400,spk_3,"I think it's fair to say there was, My Lord, in circumstances, particularly perhaps, where someone, those accused had a record for comparable offending. Well, I think it's fair to say before the change that the emphasis, I don't speak for the Lord Advocate who is ably represented here, but I would understand from practice, My Lord, that it was not uncommon to use prosecution and indictment for those whose records involved analogous offences."
p3,00:42:02.290,00:42:22.310,spk_1,"Much the most common situation would be where, for example, causing death by whatever it's called, dangerous or whatever it's called, reckless driving, and you also, the person, as it often happens, is driving without insured or whatever it is, you put these, you have all these offences on. Yes. That's the kind of situation where you tend to find these things."
p3,00:42:22.500,00:42:36.510,spk_3,"Yes, and as I would understand My Lords, if the court was concerned only with the contravention of driving while disqualified, then prosecutions and indictments tended to follow when those accused had records for comparable offending."
p3,00:42:38.100,00:43:20.530,spk_2,"And as far as the purpose of the provision is concerned, you've explained already that it was to enable cases which previously had always been taken summarily to be taken on -- sorry, I beg your pardon, those on indictment to be taken summarily, because of the increased penalty. But it would be right, wouldn't it, to look at the whole purpose of the reform because it was relieving the Sheriff, the High Court for certain things and it was also affecting the sentencing power for district courts. Is that not right? One's got to look at the entire structure of the McInnes report, I think it's called, to understand what was being legislated for here."
p3,00:43:21.360,00:44:08.110,spk_3,"My Lord, I suppose if I could make two observations in response to the last question. The background in terms of the McInnes report and the legislation is not in general terms, of course, any subject of dispute before Your Lordships. What, of course, may be a question of emphasis for the resolution of the appeal is nevertheless whether Your Lordships are focusing on the background as context or rather more substantively than that. Because, of course, Your Lordships' attention is drawn in Section 29 to focusing down on a single provision of an act if necessary. And, of course, I'm seeking to invite My Lords' attention to the particular section and say why to your Lordships, I say that it relates to a reserved matter."
p3,00:44:11.290,00:44:11.710,spk_2,Yes.
p3,00:44:16.070,00:44:31.610,spk_1,"I mean, is it in dispute that -- No, it doesn't, I'll just leave that."
p3,00:44:37.990,00:44:47.110,spk_2,"So we're going, we're really looking, are we at what relates to, or are we looking at what is meant by the phrase the purpose of the provision?"
p3,00:44:48.290,00:45:36.920,spk_3,"Well, I would understand Your Lordships may need to consider both. The first obviously, as My Lord points out, is relates to and in my submission shortly put, that's a broad expression and deliberately selected as such. And Your Lordships are then looking, of course, at Subsection 3 to see how the court may resolve the question of purpose. Now My Lords will know by way of background, insofar as this is of assistance, with some observations made about it in the debate before the House of Lords, and the materials have been, I think, produced for Your Lordships from Hansard, to say something about the background to that matter, in particular the statement of Lord [inaudible] in respect of the possible deployment of the [inaudible] doctrine, in this context."
p3,00:45:40.890,00:45:46.800,spk_1,"Before we go off to things like that, what do you say here the purpose of the provision is?"
p3,00:45:48.490,00:45:51.610,spk_3,"I say, My Lords, with respect to the purpose of the provision,"
p3,00:45:52.190,00:45:52.420,spk_0,--
p3,00:45:52.790,00:46:06.100,spk_3,is to increase the maximum term of imprisonment to 12 months in respect of prosecution on complaint in relation to statutory offences.
p3,00:46:06.930,00:46:17.700,spk_1,"Sorry, maximum, increase maximum period of imprisonment. Yes, go on."
p3,00:46:18.580,00:46:33.790,spk_3,"In respect of statutory offences, My Lord, and I say, I'll come to this if I may in due course, My Lords, but I say that the the immediate circumstances of that part of the 2007 Act indicate that the focus is on penalty."
p3,00:46:37.180,00:46:42.680,spk_0,"I'm sorry. I've written down, the purpose is to increase the maximum sentence in respect to secretary offences."
p3,00:46:42.810,00:46:47.410,spk_3,"Yes, My Lord, on prosecuted on complaint to 12 months in prison."
p3,00:46:57.280,00:47:05.040,spk_0,"Yeah. I mean, you couldn't stop short of that, could you? Because it doesn't increase the maximum sentence. That stays [inaudible]."
p3,00:47:05.880,00:47:12.090,spk_3,"Well, I appreciate My Lord, but that's part of the point that's made against me by the Lord Advocate, but"
p3,00:47:12.580,00:47:13.480,spk_0,We'll
p3,00:47:13.480,00:47:31.270,spk_3,"come back to what, of course, Your Lordships are looking at in terms of Subsection 3 as to purpose, including effect, and I say, My Lord, perhaps not surprisingly, if I may, from the appellant's vantage point of view that the effect, when Your Lordships are looking at the effect, the effect was to increase the penalty from six months to 12 months."
p3,00:47:32.380,00:47:37.490,spk_0,"But it was, if and when they chose to prosecute the summary. Yes,"
p3,00:47:37.490,00:47:38.720,spk_3,of course. I appreciate
p3,00:47:38.720,00:47:39.710,spk_0,that.
p3,00:47:40.580,00:47:52.100,spk_1,"Mr Chair, I'm old fashioned enough to think it nice to look at the section which we're actually debating. Where is it? Where do we find it in the bundle? Section 45?"

p3,00:47:54.020,00:47:58.900,spk_1,sorry. Quite nice just to look at it. Yeah.

p3,00:49:40.100,00:49:48.380,spk_3,171. Yeah. And
p3,00:49:48.380,00:49:55.010,spk_2,"when we look at Section 45, we need to look at Subsection 1, I take it, and Subsection 6."
p3,00:49:56.070,00:50:39.490,spk_3,"Absolutely. Absolutely. If Your Lordships there have access to Section 45 which is the, headed other statutory offences and My Lords will see that the point I alluded to earlier, which Your Lordships will see, Part 3 of the Act in which this section appears is under the heading Penalties. And My Lords will see that deals with common law matters, particular statutory offences in Section 44 other statutory offences in Section 45. And as My Lord the Chair year points out, Subsection 1 provides that the maximum term of imprisonment to which a person is liable on summary conviction of a relevant offence is, by virtue of this Subsection, 12 months."
p3,00:50:41.160,00:50:48.710,spk_1,"I mean, I'm just trying to remember back, but I mean, the position before this was that a common law offence is three months summary. Is that right?"
p3,00:50:48.720,00:50:49.570,spk_3,Yes.
p3,00:50:50.360,00:50:59.320,spk_1,"Statutory offence is six months, unless there was a specific provision which dealt with the sentence. Is that right?"
p3,00:50:59.330,00:51:05.270,spk_3,"Yes, My Lord, the common law offences were three or six months, six months if one had a relevant previous conviction --"
p3,00:51:05.270,00:51:06.150,spk_1,"Previous conviction, yes."
p3,00:51:06.390,00:51:13.570,spk_3,"-- in respect of statutory offences, as My Lord describes, many statutes prescribing their own penalty."
p3,00:51:14.460,00:51:15.260,spk_0,Yeah.
p3,00:51:15.960,00:51:19.520,spk_1,So the effect of this was really to say 12 months for everything.
p3,00:51:19.530,00:51:28.990,spk_3,"Yes indeed My Lord, it was. And as My Lord points out, at least on a practical level, that consistency didn't exist before the Act."
p3,00:51:29.880,00:51:44.180,spk_0,"And 44 also, I mean, there were various specific offences. If you [inaudible] a constable, you previously could only get nine, but here you are, standardising everything, making it all uniform, rounding it up to 12."
p3,00:51:44.660,00:51:45.020,spk_1,"Yes, indeed My Lord."
p3,00:51:45.270,00:51:51.390,spk_3,I don't think there could be any dispute that that's what the provisions are designed to do.
p3,00:51:54.660,00:51:57.310,spk_1,No. And indeed it appears in the long title at page

p3,00:53:04.550,00:53:18.760,spk_3,"Now My Lords will also see in my submission, perhaps of some significance in this context that Subsection 7 provides that in this section, a relevant enactment is an Act passed before this Act."

p3,00:54:38.240,00:54:51.840,spk_3,"something about in due course, but it is there. And on the face of it, relevant enactment does include an Act passed before this Act."
p3,00:55:03.440,00:55:03.880,spk_1,It's
p3,00:55:03.880,00:55:24.080,spk_2,"helpful to have had all that before us now, but coming back to Subsection 3. What is the submission, and you're saying the purpose of provision is to increase the maximum penalties in summary prosecution for statutory offences prosecuted either way to 12 months."
p3,00:55:24.810,00:55:28.970,spk_3,"And I see Your Lordships have to read it in terms of Subsection 7, which also"

p3,00:55:47.510,00:56:00.070,spk_1,"Presumably this is right, if you're right on this it would probably affect other, I mean, if you were right on the whole appeal, it would affect other Acts as well as the Road Traffic Offenders Act. Yes,"
p3,00:56:00.070,00:56:33.150,spk_3,"potentially, My Lord, the, going back to My Lord's earlier enquiry about the way matters stood beforehand, for example, My Lord, the Misuse of Drugs Act had its own specific penalty for prosecution on complaint, which was 12 months, and so many of the prosecutions obviously brought under that Act, My Lord, on the face of it, prosecutions of that character wouldn't be affected, so it would only be a relatively small number of potential reserved matter cases which were prosecuted. But yes, My Lord, there would conceivably be some resonance for other matters."
p3,00:56:34.230,00:56:47.630,spk_2,"The way the Crown put it is to, I think, accept your definition of the specific purpose, so far as it goes, I'm looking at paragraph 43 of the case"

p3,00:56:49.730,00:57:06.100,spk_2,Martin. The specific purpose is indeed to increase the sentencing powers of the court of summary jurisdiction of 12 months and enable such courts to deal with a wider range of cases. The impression I get from reading this is
p3,00:57:06.100,00:57:07.110,spk_0,that
p3,00:57:07.120,00:57:21.460,spk_2,"the argument against you is, this is really dealing with the allocation of sentencing powers between different methods of prosecution in Scotland, which is essentially a matter of Scottish criminal law."

p3,00:57:22.280,00:57:35.850,spk_2,"is not actually touching on the Road Traffic Law as such, although it may do incidentally. So this is a Section 29 2(c) case, rather than 2(b) case."
p3,00:57:37.230,00:58:05.030,spk_3,"That, My Lord, I broadly understand as part of the point which is made against the appellant, absolutely, My Lord. Nevertheless, I hope to persuade My Lords that the proper approach in the first instance is to regard as falling within 2(b) and, for the reasons which are effectively so far canvassed, the fact is that there is no dispute that the territory is reserved matters and there's no dispute that the penalty has been amended, and --"
p3,00:58:06.420,00:58:10.280,spk_5,May I take it that the defendant was powerless to influence
p3,00:58:10.820,00:58:11.010,spk_2,the
p3,00:58:11.010,00:58:14.970,spk_5,choice of venue in which she or he would be prosecuted?
p3,00:58:15.420,00:58:15.840,spk_3,"Yes, My Lord,"
p3,00:58:16.820,00:58:17.650,spk_0,for all
p3,00:58:17.650,00:58:18.650,spk_3,practical purposes.
p3,00:58:19.020,00:58:28.540,spk_5,"So I know it will give rise to enormous administrative difficulty, technically, even under the old legislation, it would be possible for all of these offences to be prosecuted on indictment."
p3,00:58:29.420,00:58:29.900,spk_3,Yes.
p3,00:58:32.120,00:58:38.330,spk_5,Does that not rather indicate this is an adjustment of venue rather than an interference with penalty?
p3,00:58:39.620,00:58:50.150,spk_3,"Well, I recognise that My Lord, and of course, as I think My Lord and the Chair has indicated. However Your Lordships come to apply the tools of analysis to the present circumstances,"
p3,00:58:50.620,00:58:51.690,spk_0,very
p3,00:58:51.690,00:59:13.700,spk_3,"crudely put, the Crown position is this is essentially an incidental matter, and the appellant's position is it goes further than that, trespasses on these provisions of the Act. Because in my respectful submission to My Lords, there is a stark indication of the penalty in the relevant part of the Road Traffic Offenders Act, which is a matter which is not disputed to be reserved matter. And it's not disputed that the penalty has been increased."
p3,00:59:13.710,00:59:38.420,spk_2,"So if I understand your position correctly, Mr Shed, you get the answer to the question simply by looking at the Act itself, it quite plainly is within Schedule 5, because it refers to road traffic legislation, this is a United Kingdom statute dealing precisely with that. And then that means that everything within that Act is a reserved matter and cannot be touched by the Scottish Parliament."
p3,00:59:38.430,00:59:56.340,spk_3,"Yes, My Lord. I'm seeking to persuade My Lords, of course, on the words of the statute that this, although it may be understandably inconvenient, there may be circumstances in which, in order to respect the proper demarcation between the Parliaments, Westminster simply has to be the body that brings forward the change."
p3,00:59:56.720,01:00:28.580,spk_2,"Yes. But there are other examples that occur to one, and I think they've been mentioned in the Calman report, which is suggestions that Scotland might be able to adjust the Act to allow for different speed limits or a different level of alcohol for drunk driving. Calman recognises, I think I'm right in saying that that would have to be done by primary legislation or the Scottish Parliament would have to be given new powers to do that. And you're saying that the penalties of pari passu with all the other things, is that correct?"
p3,01:00:28.590,01:01:35.240,spk_3,"Yes, yes, I do say that, My Lord. I recognise that the background is as set out, particularly by the Lord Advocate in her case, in terms of the the aims of the McInnes review and so on. There's no dispute laws that these are the aims in question, broadly speaking, of course, and there is no dispute that if the submission for the appellant were right, it would give rise to certain practical inconvenience. But, My Lord, in my respectful submission, that is the necessary price to pay for a proper interpretation of the provisions, precisely because My Lord, the, it's necessary in my submission to recognise that when enacting the Scotland Act of Parliament deliberately set out to limit the competence of the Scottish Parliament in certain respects. And so my submission very broadly, My Lords, is to pay proper deference to that scheme. There are occasions in which a challenge of this kind inevitably be brought and, in my respectful submission, inevitably be well founded, whether this be the case or not is for Your Lordships to judge, but in my submission, it's a recognition of the fact"
p3,01:01:35.610,01:01:36.530,spk_0,"that the,"
p3,01:01:37.110,01:01:45.930,spk_3,those framing the Scotland Act had in mind that these very particular provisions would be introduced with a view to limiting the competence of the Scottish Parliament.
p3,01:01:48.020,01:01:54.560,spk_1,"Going back to the effect of this as Lord Kerr was saying,"
p3,01:01:57.510,01:01:57.830,spk_3,
p3,01:01:59.310,01:03:06.720,spk_1,"I mean, the, in the past you would only, in fact, in any time you would only prosecute one of these things on indictment if, for some reason to think that it was particularly serious matter for some reason, I mean the effect of the change is, I suppose, that now a Sheriff looking at an offence which is prosecuted, which was just exactly the same offence as would have been prosecuted before the amendment says to himself, Well, this is an offence for which Parliament, Scottish Parliament has now prescribed a maximum penalty of 12 months on indictment, on a summary. Does that affect, does that in any way, I was previously looking at it. He would have said, Well, the maximum I can give for this is six months and therefore I think it's not a terribly bad case, it's halfway up the scale, halfway up the scale is now six months, whereas previously halfway up the scale was three months. I mean, is that any part of the argument?"
p3,01:03:07.200,01:03:36.440,spk_3,"Well, My Lord, I am inviting My Lords to look at the effect, and I say that there's a, in, the legal effect, My Lord, if I can put it that way, is that the provisions of the Road Traffic Offenders Act have been modified in this way, and the penalty was six months, and now it's 12. And in my respectful submission, that's the prime focus. The question that My Lord raises, of course, is effectively, My Lord, goes back to questions of prosecutorial choice, effectively."
p3,01:03:36.650,01:03:55.660,spk_1,"Yeah, but I mean, prosecutors choose exactly the same venue, but the effect of the change is, that something which is a sort of halfway up the scale thing now is halfway up a scale which has got 12 months for it, whereas previously with half up, half a scale, which had six months for"

p3,01:04:02.910,01:04:36.790,spk_5,"Bearing the gifts. In fact, not for the first time, Lord Rodgers question prompts a thought directly contrary to the one I expressed earlier, because in effect, what he's saying surely is, you could expect if you were charged with driving while disqualified to be prosecuted summarily. And in those circumstances, the maximum penalty that you would face was six months. Now, you can still expect risk prosecuted summarily. But the maximum penalty for this is 12 months. Yes, indeed My Lord. And that, you say, is the effect."
p3,01:04:36.800,01:04:37.610,spk_3,Yes.
p3,01:04:38.290,01:05:15.810,spk_0,"I mean, doesn't somebody give any sentencing guidelines? I don't know. Maybe Scotland, unlike England, have lots of empty prisons. But in this country, on the whole, judges are recommended not to pass longer sentences than strictly they need. Somebody might following this sort of amendment have said to the Sheriff, For heaven's sake, of course, you know, you're now, you've got an increased power of sentence, but for heaven's sake, remember that you're not actually trying to increase sentences. What you're trying to do is simply deal with cases that earlier might have had to go on indictment."
p3,01:05:16.590,01:05:42.090,spk_3,"Well, I think, My Lord, if I could answer My Lord's question, historically in Scotland, such guidance in relation to sentences was given, was given by the Appeal Court from time to time in appropriate judgments. There is, as I understand, it now proposed a sentencing guideline Council in Scotland, which is, I think, not terribly far removed from the position in England and Wales.

So there were a number of practical arguments as a consequence of that kind of change, and it's it's a reflection, I think, of the point My Lord was just making. In some cases there would be that kind of argument, no doubt before the Court of Appeal."

Because 4 is envisaging a provision which would otherwise not relate to reserve matters otherwise it fails under (b), but makes modifications of reading short Scots criminal law, which we know includes penalties, as it applies to reserve matters. Now, one could say that what we're really looking at in Section 45 is a provision which is making a modification of Scots criminal law as it applies to reserve matters, which is certainly plain enough because it's dealing with the road"

So what I'm suggesting is that the sort of head on approach, which you get in (b), while very attractive, it doesn't fit very easily with what the section goes on to talk about, which may, on a reading of that provision, Subsection 4, seem to be more apt to deal with the case we're looking at."

It's designed to, as I understand, it's designed to cater for the situation where one does not, cannot meet the test in 2(b) saying the provision relates to reserve matters, then 4 requires consideration of the legislation to see whether it's to be deemed as relating to reserve matters.

Speed limits is just simply stated. It doesn't, I don't think, it's plain enough. There's no different speed limit for Scotland in the Act, as it stands at the moment, it's simply a UK speed limit, generally according to the type of road you're on. And so it would be difficult to say that that had anything to do with Scots criminal law in the sense that it's dealing with prosecution practice or penalties or anything of that kind because it doesn't get to that stage, it's simply stating what the offence is.

But I recognise, My Lords that the argument against me plainly is that that doesn't apply. And then, Your Lordships are looking at the rest of the provisions in whichever order commends itself to Your Lordships. Obviously, Subsection 4 is relevant because then, as My Lord Rodger points out, one is looking at something which does not meet the test in 2(b) and therefore may nevertheless meet the test in 4 as set out.

First of all as well My Lords have observed, this is on the assumption that the matter is not related to reserve matter, 4(b) makes modifications to Scots criminal law as it applies to reserve matters for reasons which have been touched upon. My submission on the appellant's behalf is that that is met because My Lords are concerned particularly with the Road Traffic Offenders Act.

My Lords will see that in interpreting what is meant by relates it's intended that the court should rely upon the reception doctrine which they developed in dealing with cases arising from Commonwealth constitutions and the Government of Ireland Act in 1920. And the classic statement is found in the words of Lord Atkin in Gallagher and Lynn, where he state, It's well established You ought to look at the true nature and character, the pith and substance of the legislation.

Lord Sewel's talking about Amendment number 153, which I think is inserting the provision, which is Subsection 3, isn't it? It's to be determined by reference to the purpose of the provisions. Yes, he says, well, the courts can determine that a provision is for a permitted purpose, even if, as an ancillary matter, it affects reserved matters again. Now again, it might be thought that that is against you, too, because it affects traffic legislation, that the purpose is to adjust the the criminal jurisdiction of the Sheriff. Yes.

His Lordship then calls attention to the terms of Section 4 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 in terms of which the provisions relating to Northern Ireland remain in force. My Lords will see they're set out subject to the provisions of this Act of Parliament, Northern Ireland shall have power to make laws for the peace order and good government of Northern Ireland with the following limitations, namely, shall not have power to make laws except in respect of matters exclusively relating to the portion of Ireland within their jurisdiction or some part thereof and without prejudice to that general limitation, they shall not have power to make laws in respect to the following matters in particularly, in particular, namely, 7, trade with any place out of the part of Ireland within their jurisdiction, except in as far as trade may be affected by the exercise of the powers of taxation given to the said Parliament, or by regulation's made for the sole purpose of preventing the previous disease, or by steps taken by means of inquiries or agencies out of the part of Ireland within their jurisdiction, for the improvement of trade that part or for the protection of traders that part from fraud. It is said that the provisions of the Milk Act interfere with, indeed put an end to the trade and milk between the farmers of Donegal and the customers in Derry, and that therefore they offend against express limitations imposed by Section 4. My Lords, the short answer to this is that the milk, this milk Act is not a law in respect of trade, but is a law for the peace order and good government of Northern Ireland in respect of precautions taken to"

If, on the view of the statute as a whole, you find the substance of the legislation is within the express powers, then it's not invalidated if, incidentally, it affects matters which are outside the authorised field. The legislation must not, under the guise of dealing with one matter, in fact encroach upon the forbidden field. Nor are you to look only at the object of the legislature. An Act may have a perfectly lawful object, for example, to promote the health of the inhabitants, but may seek to achieve that object by invalid methods for example, a direct prohibition of any trade with a foreign country. In other words, you would certainly consider the clauses of an Act to see whether they are passed in respect of the forbidden subject. In the present case, any suggestion of an indirect Act upon trade is disclaimed by the appellant. There could be no foundation for it. The true nature and character of the Act, its pith and substance, is that it is an Act to protect the health of the inhabitants of Northern Ireland in those circumstances, though it may incidentally affect trade with County Donegal, it's not passed in respect of trade and is therefore not subject to attack on that ground.

But the observation of Lord Chief Justice made was to this effect, both object and method must be valid, and there is force in the argument that the method employed in regulation 31 is invalid because and insofar as it makes use of members of the forces to achieve the lawful object of preserving the peace and maintaining order."

p3,01:37:00.430,01:37:03.880,spk_3,"I'm sorry My Lord, I appreciate it's, I'm trying to cut the matter a little shorter My Lords,"
p3,01:37:03.980,01:37:05.510,spk_0,hoping
p3,01:37:05.510,01:37:07.810,spk_3,it's not distorting the context entirely. I
p3,01:37:07.810,01:37:19.120,spk_0,"mean, in a sentence, I don't actually know what these, this case is all about, but it looks to be about the use of -- what, how does it work? What was the issue? Basically, My Lord,"
p3,01:37:19.250,01:37:31.950,spk_3,"we'll see, perhaps the easiest way, if I can draw My Lords' attention to it briefly, is to look at, on to page 115. The Lord Chief Justice's conclusions on the matter are summarised in paragraph's 1 to 6."
p3,01:37:34.530,01:37:34.700,spk_0,It
p3,01:37:34.700,01:37:52.810,spk_3,"was giving powers, My Lords, to members of the armed forces as opposed to police officers, broadly speaking. My Lords, we'll see summarised in those propositions, the words, Any commissioned officer of Her Majesty's forces on duty and any member of Her Majesty's forces on duty are descriptive of subject matter within the forbidden"

p3,01:38:03.010,01:38:09.800,spk_3,"same general meaning throughout Section 41 and are nowhere confined to the imposition of burdens, controls or obligations. That's an"
p3,01:38:09.810,01:38:10.770,spk_1,objection
p3,01:38:10.770,01:39:12.830,spk_3,"of an argument advanced by the Crown. The intention of the legislature is to be derived from the words of Section 41. The reference to the forbidden subject matter is not a matter of incidental effect, as defined in Gallagher and Lynn, but is an example of the achievement of a lawful object by invalid methods. And even though regulation 31 is in respect of the preservation of the peace and the maintenance of order, it is also by virtue of the powers conferred on officers and members of Her Majesty's forces on duty in respect of the subject matter included in paragraph 3 of Section 41, and to that extent contravenes the limitations nearby. So My Lords will see just taking proposition 6 for the moment, in that case, at least, the conclusion was that although the regulation was also in respect of preservation of peace and so on, it was also in respect of the subject matter, which is referred to paragraph 3 of Section 41, and to that extent contravened the relevant limitation."
p3,01:39:13.250,01:39:21.820,spk_1,"In other words, the object was, one of the objects, the preservation of peace, that's something which the Northern Ireland Parliament had power to legislate for. Yes. Whereas the other matter was not. Yes indeed My Lord."
p3,01:39:22.320,01:39:26.520,spk_0,Where is paragraphs 341?
p3,01:39:27.220,01:39:34.240,spk_4,"It's summarised in the head note at page 91, basic for the armed forces of the crown."
p3,01:39:34.870,01:39:35.610,spk_3,"Yes, indeed."
p3,01:39:37.920,01:39:38.110,spk_1,And
p3,01:39:38.110,01:39:41.850,spk_2,the holding sets it out quite neatly on page 92
p3,01:39:42.420,01:39:44.160,spk_0,"I think. Yes,"
p3,01:39:44.160,01:41:00.630,spk_3,"I am obliged from it. Perhaps I should have taken My Lords to that, My Lord's will see that reading from the second paragraph on page 92, the convicted persons applied to the High Court to quash the convictions, read short, that first having regard to Section 413 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920, it was outside the competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament and the minister who purported to make the regulation to confer powers on any member of Her Majesty's forces on duty acting on his behalf. Secondly, that regulation 381 did not conform to the powers of the Northern Ireland parliament or executive, under the 1920 Act to make laws for the Peace order and Good Government in Northern Ireland. Also the power of the Minister of Home Affairs under Section 13 of the Civil Authorities Special Powers Act, Northern Ireland 1922. To make regulation's for the preservation of the peace and the maintenance of order because it was not conducive to peace, order and good government or in particular, to the preservation of the peace and the maintenance of order and because it was excessively far reaching and oppressive. And it was held that the provisions of section for 4(1) of the act which imposed the limitation that the Parliament Northern Ireland shall not the power to make laws in respect to the matters set out in that subsection precluded the making by the Minister of a Regulation under the Civil Authorities Special Powers Act Northern Ireland 1922 which purported to confer powers and officers and members of Her Majesty's forces into two."
p3,01:41:01.310,01:41:09.560,spk_2,"How do you say we should apply that decision in this case, having regard to the way the legislation is set out in the Scotland."
p3,01:41:09.570,01:41:52.550,spk_3,"I respectfully draw attention to it because it appears that there's support, at least in this decision, for looking at the objects and methods as part of the analysis. And that is one matter which Your Lordships could regard as helpful in construing Section 29 Subsection 3 and in Proposition 6 on page 115 My Lords see that the matter may have more than one aspect, one of which trespasses on in this context, the reserve matter or, more broadly described sometimes the forbidden field. And if so, that may be sufficient for Your Lordships to reach the conclusion."
p3,01:41:53.260,01:41:55.630,spk_5,"If I put the argument somewhat simplistic in this way,"
p3,01:41:56.110,01:41:57.040,spk_0,
p3,01:41:57.610,01:42:04.830,spk_5,the Parliament of Northern Ireland was empowered to pass legislation for the peace order and government of Northern Ireland.

p3,01:42:06.200,01:42:33.970,spk_5,"purported to confer powers on members of the armed forces in order to achieve that object. But it was forbidden by Section 4 to legislate for Her Majesty's armed forces, and therefore it might be said that the object or the purpose of the legislation was within the legislative competence of the Parliament in that it was for the peace order and good government. The means by"

p3,01:42:34.830,01:42:41.840,spk_5,it purported to affect that objective was forbidden by Section 4.
p3,01:42:41.850,01:42:54.470,spk_3,"Well, I'm very much obliged Your Lordship, that's a the point I was endeavouring to take from the matter. Please."
p3,01:42:55.870,01:42:56.900,spk_1,Yeah.
p3,01:42:57.600,01:43:08.520,spk_0,Thank you. Yes.
p3,01:43:10.550,01:43:10.710,spk_2,and
p3,01:43:10.710,01:43:38.670,spk_3,"of course, laws me and indeed, in my submission are concerned with a particular provision under scrutiny which Section 45. And I've drawn My Lords' attention to the fact that there is reference in that to any enactment passed before the act And in my respectful submission, Well, that is an express, albeit indirect reference to, the Forbidden Field so in my submission."
p3,01:43:38.980,01:43:42.940,spk_2,"You mean by that, it's an express reference to Inter Alia the Road Traffic Act."

p3,01:43:54.500,01:43:55.010,spk_2,Yes.
p3,01:43:56.700,01:44:07.700,spk_3,"So My Lords I respectfully suggest that those matters those observations can be taken from, observations particular Royal Chief Justice Lowry. In that particular case,"
p3,01:44:08.990,01:44:09.690,spk_0,I've already
p3,01:44:09.690,01:44:25.130,spk_3,addressed Your Lordships of what I respectfully submit Your Lordship should see as the object of the legislation that was described as purpose. But I asked My Lords to look at it also in terms of object and method I've dealt with briefly. The question of object to the question of method in my respectful submission would be
p3,01:44:25.790,01:44:26.080,spk_1,by
p3,01:44:26.080,01:44:34.820,spk_3,amending the specification of the maximum term of imprisonment in the penalty provisions of the relevant statutes.
p3,01:44:35.290,01:44:38.920,spk_0,
p3,01:44:42.990,01:44:45.810,spk_2,Yes.
p3,01:44:47.090,01:45:17.710,spk_3,"And as because I think we have seen from some of the matters we should discuss in the authorities, there may be two other questions which would be of some assistance to Your Lordships. The first would be this Section 45 in respect of a matter within the authorised field. Obviously, I would invite My Lords to answer that question in the negative. The second question was, does it purport to legislate in respect of a subject matter outside the authorised field? Plainly, I would invite My Lords in this branch of the argument to answer that question in the affirmative."
p3,01:45:19.990,01:45:21.620,spk_0,
p3,01:45:22.790,01:45:40.120,spk_3,"And I asked most to do that, in part because of the reference in subsection seven to relevant enactment. Because I respectfully invite blows to the view that makes express reference to the forbidden top. Albeit it's indirect,"
p3,01:45:46.290,01:45:56.920,spk_2,"well, isn't pretty much everything. You want to stay on subsection to be read with subsection three."
p3,01:45:56.930,01:45:58.620,spk_3,"Yes, I'm obliged."
p3,01:46:01.780,01:46:01.980,spk_1,

p3,01:46:07.580,01:46:20.650,spk_2,"And is it best to go to Schedule 4 because it looks as though that should come in before one looks at Subsection 4, really because one wants -- yes indeed -- to know whether we'll little c is satisfied."

p3,01:46:26.880,01:46:31.940,spk_3,Attention again to the relevant provisions of the schedule. They are found on
p3,01:46:31.950,01:46:32.600,spk_1,page
p3,01:46:32.980,01:46:34.710,spk_3,71 of the Scotland Act.
p3,01:46:36.980,01:46:50.000,spk_0,"Yeah. Yeah, Changes. Sorry, where are we going to?"
p3,01:46:50.580,01:46:54.820,spk_3,My Lord its volume 9. It's
p3,01:46:57.580,01:47:00.540,spk_0,"Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Page 1. It's"
p3,01:47:00.540,01:47:05.000,spk_3,"page, particularly page 71 My lord. That's schedule 4(2). The act?"
p3,01:47:06.980,01:47:16.980,spk_0,Yeah. All right. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah.
p3,01:47:23.080,01:47:48.810,spk_3,"My Lords have already caused to notice the particular provisions, My Lord, perhaps I can try to put it into context of the present case if I could. And ask My Lords to take 2(1) and 2(2) to read them together and reading them short in the present context. I say, My Lord, what that produces is this that an act of the Scottish Parliament cannot modify any enactment, the subject matter of which is a reserved matter."
p3,01:47:51.880,01:47:55.600,spk_2,"We know from the definition section that includes amendment,"
p3,01:47:55.980,01:47:56.720,spk_3,indeed
p3,01:47:56.720,01:47:57.000,spk_0,not.
p3,01:47:57.780,01:48:08.390,spk_3,And so I respectfully submit Lord that the relevant part of the Road Traffic Offenders Act which logics are most concerned that comes within that definition.
p3,01:48:12.870,01:48:23.080,spk_1,So that's a which sub paragraph's which one you were just reading?
p3,01:48:23.790,01:48:26.320,spk_3,My Lord I was reading to 21 and 22 together.
p3,01:48:26.320,01:48:27.690,spk_1,Thank you.
p3,01:48:28.570,01:48:47.490,spk_3,And reading short mode as they were trying to put it in the present context. But My Lord I recognise that the but comes now as it were. But the restriction applies only to the extent that the rule is special to reserve matter and My Lord's find that in sub paragraph 3.
p3,01:48:50.770,01:48:56.090,spk_2,"So we are dealing, are we with the rule of Scots criminal law?"
p3,01:48:56.470,01:49:08.990,spk_3,"Well, in my submission, Your Lordships are and that comes again, Lord, from the definition interpretation Section of 126 Subsection 5, which includes in the context of Scots criminal law Penalties."
p3,01:49:10.470,01:49:12.600,spk_0,I'm losing the plot at the moment.
p3,01:49:13.170,01:49:13.850,spk_3,I'm sorry.
p3,01:49:14.460,01:49:33.600,spk_0,"I mean, I follow what you just said."
p3,01:49:35.770,01:49:38.890,spk_3,"As I understand, it lowers the"
p3,01:49:38.900,01:49:40.030,spk_0,structures are simply
p3,01:49:40.030,01:49:50.090,spk_3,trying to read it short. Maybe the structure is to start with the restriction on the Scottish Parliament not modifying the law and the law and reserved matters and which is obviously
p3,01:49:50.570,01:49:51.460,spk_1,"yeah, a"
p3,01:49:51.470,01:50:14.980,spk_3,"phrase deliberately selected. And My Lords will see that the law and reserved matters is then effectively defined in two E for present purposes. Yeah, which is effectively, statute, law and be as I would understand, it's effectively common law rules. And those matters are then brought together in sub paragraph 3"
p3,01:50:16.760,01:50:17.020,spk_1,to
p3,01:50:17.020,01:50:27.070,spk_3,see the prohibition applies in this context only to the extent that the ruling question is special to reserve matter.
p3,01:50:28.560,01:51:02.190,spk_2,"Can I just see if I follow this? That you accept that in order to understand 21, you have to go 223 because we're dealing with a rule of Scots criminal law because we're looking at penalties for Scotland? That's fine. And but so paragraph 1 sub paragraph 1 applies only to the extent the ruling question is special. To reserve matter. How does one determine whether that is the case or isn't the case of Section 45?"
p3,01:51:02.210,01:51:24.970,spk_3,"Yes, indeed, that is obviously, if I may say so, the next question of what meaning of your projects to give to that expression. As I understand it, the expression is not defined in the act itself, unfortunately, But I would submit, I think, in common with the co appellant, that some guidance may be derived from the explanatory note to the act,"
p3,01:51:24.980,01:51:25.270,spk_0,because
p3,01:51:25.270,01:51:29.120,spk_3,I understand that most would find it too. Volume a tab 106.
p3,01:51:29.240,01:51:30.530,spk_2,It is
p3,01:51:30.530,01:51:36.580,spk_3,"also My Lord conveniently set out, perhaps more readily for your logic to benefit in Mr Miller's case at paragraph 55."
p3,01:51:39.460,01:51:48.290,spk_2,
p3,01:51:48.760,01:52:00.140,spk_0,Thank you. And
p3,01:52:00.220,01:52:31.760,spk_3,"this may be the final special, maybe a convenient way to look at the matter if you launch its first at paragraph 55. Mr Miller's printed case My Lords will see there is reference to page at page 200. The explanatory note laws will see it as a sub paragraph 3 provides, a restriction on modification applies to rule of Scots private criminal law only to the extent that the rule in question is special. To reserve matter. A rule which results in a distinct and separate treatment of reserve matter and two other specified aspects of private law."
p3,01:52:33.220,01:52:40.770,spk_4,"Special is often used in contradistinction to general, and that seems to me the most natural meaning of it here isn't it?"
p3,01:52:41.150,01:53:11.160,spk_3,"Well, I acknowledge the force of that Lord. Certainly the Parliament plainly didn't think it necessary to provide a particular definition. My Lord, but I would respectfully submit that that guidance is perhaps of some assistance to the court. There's also in paragraph 56 of the printed case reference to statements made by Lord Schule again reproduced enhancer the references or they are given. And perhaps I can just draw your attention to that briefly if I could"
p3,01:53:11.340,01:53:12.700,spk_2,do it.
p3,01:53:12.750,01:53:13.220,spk_1,This is
p3,01:53:13.230,01:53:14.810,spk_2,this is the next paragraph
p3,01:53:14.870,01:53:15.750,spk_3,for convenience.
p3,01:53:15.760,01:53:16.840,spk_2,It's
p3,01:53:16.840,01:53:49.980,spk_3,"also in the Hansard, which is more fully reproduced in the volumes. But the references there given that paragraph 56 My Lord, and there is something said about this topic, and perhaps I could just simply read that to My Lords, the new test in Schedule 4 applies generally in the case of Scots private and criminal law. However, it applies only to certain specified aspects of private law and to the rules of Scots private criminal law, which are special to reserve matters, those which result in a distinct and separate treatment of a reserved matter."
p3,01:53:50.740,01:53:50.920,spk_0,In
p3,01:53:50.920,01:54:35.930,spk_3,"the latter case, the rules will include not only those which exist at present, but also any private or criminal law provisions in future Westminster legislation, which are special to reserve matters and which would, of course, superseded to that extent any general provisions of Scots private law. Yeah, and then My Lords' may see that references need two particular examples, and the first is Section 90 of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act in 1988 which categorises copyright as movable property and provides that an assassination of copyright is not effective unless it's in writing, signed by or on behalf of the assign. Or this is a special rule of Scots private law and a reserve matter designed to protect the interests of an owner of"
p3,01:54:35.930,01:54:36.590,spk_1,copyright.
p3,01:54:37.050,01:54:41.980,spk_3,"Secondly, in the case of betting, gaming and lotteries, the rule that gaming contracts cannot be enforced on the"
p3,01:54:41.990,01:54:42.790,spk_1,basis that there's
p3,01:54:43.240,01:54:50.160,spk_3,"on a good cry and thirdly, the provisions of the proceeds of Crime Scotland Act, which makes special provisions about confiscating the proceeds of drug"

p3,01:54:51.240,01:54:55.460,spk_3,"Yeah, so those are the examples which are referred to."
p3,01:54:57.740,01:55:11.460,spk_0,I'm trying to sort of cross relate this this whole schedule for with Subsection 1 of Section 29 which also deals with modifications of Scots criminal law.
p3,01:55:12.940,01:55:13.910,spk_3,And
p3,01:55:13.920,01:55:29.040,spk_0,"then the provider. That's wrong. It's OK as long as it prize consistently to reserve matters and otherwise, I mean seems to be something of the same thinking. But I don't see how they interrelated at all."
p3,01:55:29.540,01:56:22.530,spk_3,"Well, it has been, as I understand, it suggested that My Lords, might care to apply their judgement to the schedule in relation to the particular question, which I'm seeking to address at the moment boards. That is whether the provisions special to reserve matter. If I failed to persuade Your Lordships that that was the position here, then nevertheless, My Lord would be arguing that Section 29(4) would still have to come into contemplation. So I invite Lords to take that view. And if I if I do so it's been it's been contended that that's the proper approach mode, and I simply draw attention. Or if I could, at this stage to the Lord Clyde his book on judicial review, which the Advocate General is helpfully produced in a supplementary bundle of authorities for the for Your Lordships benefit."
p3,01:56:22.540,01:56:26.150,spk_0,"I mean, what is the rule in question here?"
p3,01:56:27.230,01:56:44.060,spk_3,"The rule in question world in my submission because this is effectively trying to read paragraphs to A and B together which contemplate different situations. One statutory, one common law. In my submission, the rule in question is the penalty contained in the Road Traffic Offenders act."
p3,01:56:44.930,01:57:41.410,spk_2,"Well, is it? They said against you? I'm looking at paragraph 54 of the Lord Advocates case that we're looking at a maximum sentence of imprisonment which really is inherent. I think it's to be found in the Criminal Procedure Scotland Act, I may be wrong. The maximum sentence available on summary procedure prior to the amendment I'm talking about was a rule that was not special to the Road traffic act at all. It was one that applied generally to all statutory offences and examples are given in the Lord Advocate's case of statutes such as the Civic Government, Scotland Act, the protection of Wild Animals, Scotland Act, Sexual Offences, Act, and so on and so forth which are not reserved and therefore we're dealing with a statutory maximum which applies across the board to both reserved and not reserved statutory offences."

One is Section 29. The other is most of the paragraphs, but not all the paragraphs are schedule 4(1). And one finds they seem to have have similar sort of ideas.

It's about half a dozen lines or so into the paragraph, said that in relation to rules of Scots private law and Scots criminal law, which formed part of the law on reserved matters schedule 4 paragraph 23 contains an important qualification, the effect of which is to make some saving of the Scottish Parliament's competence to modify rules of Scots private law in Scots criminal law. Except where the rules in question are special to reserve matter, the Scottish Parliament has competence to modify the rules. However, the Scottish Parliament's competence over the modification of Scots private law and Scots criminal law still remains subject to Section 29(4), which, as noted above, restricts the parliament's competence to modify Scots private law in Scots criminal law as they apply to reserve matters, unless the purpose of the modifications to make the law apply consistently to reserve matters and other ones. Accordingly, the parliament's powers over rules of Scots law, which do not form part of the law on reserved matters because they are not special to reserve matters, must still satisfy the conditions of Section 29(4).

p3,02:08:01.010,02:09:29.720,spk_3,"The Lords will see where they learned authors are dealing with with this part of the act in the schedule. My Lords, we'll see that again, references made to the provisions, which I think, takes the Lord's again to footnote 7 or 8 lines down. And then the authors say this on its terms. Schedule 4 paragraph 3 concerns only modifications of the law and reserve matters and not provisions passed by the parliament which do not amount to modifications of the existing law nor modifications of Scots private law Scots criminal law, as they apply to reserve matters. But in so far as it applies, the effect of paragraph 3 is to introduce a form of proportionality test into the assessment of the incidental effects, of otherwise competent enactments of the Scottish Parliament on reserve matters. Where such effects on reserve matters are proportionate, In terms of, Section, Paragraph 3(1)(b), the provision will not be treated as modifying the law and reserved matters equally where the effects and reserved matters are disproportionate it will be so treated. By virtue of court, Paragraph 3, Courts must weigh the purpose of a challenge provisions understood by reference to parliament's competence against the nature and severity of its impact on reserve matters. In short, the purpose is lawful and the effects are not too bad. By reference to the need to achieve the purpose, the provision will be competent. It may be that such an approach will come to be applicable generally in determining the proper scope of the parliament's competence as it relates to reserve matters."
p3,02:09:29.730,02:10:16.340,spk_2,"There are two steps in paragraph 3 and subparagraph 1. First of all you got to find out whether this is a modification is an amendment which is some incidental to or consequential on a provision made which does not relate to reserve matters. And your fundamental point is that perfectly, obviously does relate to matters, and therefore the Lord Advocate has to fail under anyway. Assuming he can succeed, then the question is under b, does it have a greater effect than is necessary to give effect to the purpose? That's more difficult for you isn't it? Because if the purpose is to adjust the the jurisdiction of the sheriff's sentencing powers, it's simply doing that. It's not going any further than it is necessary to achieve that."

p3,02:10:31.880,02:10:38.880,spk_2,proportionality isn't really in the point. Here it's really either yes or no to 3(1)(a). I would have thought --

But I have I would respectfully commend these observations, mobbed by the authors in question because it may be of some assistance dealerships and looking at what paragraph 3 in relation to these two matters was designed to do.

The act deals with this problem by reference to the parliament's competence in relation to Scots law and the law on reserved matters. In effect, the Scotland Act provides that the law and reserved matters is reserved. The Scottish Parliament has in general no power to modify it. In contrast, Scots private lawn Scots criminal law are not reserved. The Scottish Parliament again, in general, has power to modify them. But this apparently simple dichotomy will inevitably hides great complexity. First, the rule the law on I beg your pardon. First, the law and reserved matters will inevitably include rules of Scots law. Therefore, some rules of Scots law reserved by operation of Schedules 4 and 5. Secondly, even where rules of Scots private law in Scots criminal law do not form part of the law and reserved matters, modifications of those rules may affect reserved matters or the law and reserved matters. For example, the reform of the ordinary law of contract may have some effect on reserved employment law. Scotland Act attempts to deal with these difficulties in Section 29(4) and scheduled to the act. The act is distinctly with modifications by the parliament of the law and reserved Matters, the subject of Schedule four discussed as we have seen and modifications of Scots private law in Scots criminal law as they apply to reserve matters dealt with by Section 29(4).

And so on Section 29(4) appears to apply only only to apply to modifications of Scots private law and Scots criminal law and not, for example, restatements of existing law.

p3,02:20:37.570,02:20:53.620,spk_3,"and so on the other hand, plainly these provisions have in mind. To some extent, this has been pointed out in the written cases, as well as a fetter on the power. It's also, provides a facility whereby the scheme isn't applied too rigidly"
p3,02:20:54.390,02:20:54.790,spk_0,to
p3,02:20:54.800,02:21:00.720,spk_3,permit the Scottish Parliament to take certain steps which would not otherwise trespass and reserved matters.

That's it, yes, that's it's main purpose. The last bit is to carve out an exception to that, you say that that doesn't apply, which they're putting on it doesn't apply for. The purpose is just to make the law apply consistently on both sides. Yes, so it's a it's an exception tour to a general prohibition."
p3,02:21:54.310,02:22:42.830,spk_3,"I don't in any way due to My Lord's proposed analysis of the matter, but I say, Lord, that provides that if if I'm a slightly greater illumination of this scheme, because these are all about the restrictions on the on the power of the Scottish Parliament, generally to legislate and reserved matters. But to draw that line too brightly would no doubt produce unwelcome inflexibility so far as the Scottish Parliament is concerned. But that's why I respectfully submit My Lord, the matter should be seen in the way that broadly suggested so crudely, very crudely put but it could be regarded as something of this being within the Scottish Parliament's part 2 embarked upon a tidying up exercise to achieve consistency,"
p3,02:22:43.200,02:22:55.250,spk_2,can tidy up to achieve consistency but not reform to alter what is in the legislation there and was in itself not inconsistent before the Parliament got to work on it
p3,02:22:57.200,02:22:57.920,spk_3,and then elected
p3,02:22:57.920,02:23:01.900,spk_1,legislative first and one way and then tied it up afterward.
p3,02:23:03.100,02:23:23.080,spk_3,"Absolutely, but I respectfully submit My Lord with assistance of the observations balloons are making just now that that is entirely consistent with the with the overarching scheme of this part of the Scotland"
p3,02:23:23.080,02:23:33.860,spk_2,"Act. Well, just about completed your submissions."
p3,02:23:35.000,02:23:35.450,spk_3,So
p3,02:23:35.450,02:23:40.540,spk_2,you've really reached the end of these provisions. There's nothing else. Once we reach Subsection 4

p3,02:23:44.310,02:24:26.620,spk_3,"indeed, in an effort vain effort to impose some order in what was proposed to say to Your Lordships, I thought it would deal with Section 101 last, but Your Lordships have already asked me to say something about that. And it's not contentious My Lord, I think among the parties. My Lords, the different formulations, modern respect of how Your Lordships might approach Section 1012) should it arise, My Lord and if I can just simply give My Lord of the references to those in the appellant's case that is paragraph 56 in the core appellant's case, paragraph 122, in The Advocate General's case paragraph 72, in the Lord Advocates case Paragraph 61. But I don't detect any fundamental difference on the approach."

p3,02:24:58.550,02:25:00.570,spk_3,"in my submission on any view, raises an important"
p3,02:25:00.580,02:25:03.510,spk_2,issue. This is whether we should postpone.
p3,02:25:04.090,02:25:04.600,spk_1,And
p3,02:25:04.610,02:25:08.950,spk_2,"any order we make is they're trying to give an opportunity for something to be done about it. Yes,"
p3,02:25:08.950,02:25:45.420,spk_3,"indeed. And if the laws would permit it, I wouldn't wish to get drawn into the matter at this stage. It may be I wish to say something to My Lords in due course. If the Advocate deputy addresses the matter, it is in my submission, conceivably a difficult topic which perhaps couldn't be adequately debated in the time available and on one view, in any event, law that could be regarded as academic for present purposes since the crown acknowledge that if the appellants the present appellants are correct, then no such restrictions should apply to them."
p3,02:25:47.390,02:25:57.050,spk_2,"Yes, well, it's better. I think perhaps we should hear from the advocate depute, and you would have a chance to comment on his submissions, if appropriate. Yes,"
p3,02:25:57.050,02:25:57.840,spk_3,"well, I'm most obliged My Lord."

p4,00:01:21.240,00:01:24.260,spk_1,Could you just bring us up to date on what happened to
p4,00:01:24.260,00:01:55.990,spk_0,"him? Well, he was sentenced to seven months in relation to a complaint [inaudible]. Yeah. He pled at the first opportunity [inaudible] does not give any hint as to whether or not allowance was made for [inaudible], but obviously the [inaudible] is, it was a sentence beyond what we would suggest [inaudible]. Indeed, yes."
p4,00:01:56.160,00:01:57.640,spk_1,Yes.
p4,00:02:00.140,00:02:50.630,spk_0,"The second issue, My Lord, relates to the discussion of disqualified driving before the 2007 Act came into effect and the distinction between indictment proceedings, and summary proceedings. In my [inaudible], the principal use of the [inaudible] proceedings was simply a progression from repeated summary offending and marked a way for the court to make clear that this would be taken more seriously, and that was the norm as opposed to [inaudible] Lord Roger Earlsferry, association other matters, it should also be borne in mind, of course, that in terms of the proceedings Section 103 prosecutions would always of necessity stand alone, because of the nature of the allegations. Yes."

p4,00:03:09.840,00:03:12.030,spk_2,"Yes, it could be put on a separate indictment. Yes, My Lord, yes."
p4,00:03:13.890,00:03:19.030,spk_1,"But in practice, your suggesting it would be taken summarily, separately or?"
p4,00:03:20.140,00:03:44.830,spk_0,"[Inaudible] institutions where more serious offences are prosecuted on indictment [inaudible], it was used on indictment to mark [inaudible] into more or into repeat offending [inaudible]. Yes. You"
p4,00:03:44.830,00:04:03.860,spk_3,"couldn't try together with dangerous driving. No, [inaudible] indictment, it would be two distinct proceedings. But were they all heard together by the same, they wouldn't be? No, [inaudible] situation where [inaudible] driving and convicting and then the matter proceeded before a second jury to establish. [Crosstalk]."
p4,00:04:04.040,00:04:08.790,spk_2,"Is that how we do it this side of the border too? I mean, I should [inaudible]. I doubt it. [Inaudible]."
p4,00:04:08.800,00:04:13.950,spk_1,"I mean, we're very cautious about revealing previous convictions, and I think that's the point."
p4,00:04:13.950,00:04:26.390,spk_0,[Inaudible] that's [inaudible] at 103 was first envisaged [inaudible] certainly Scotland [inaudible]. What's the reason
p4,00:04:26.390,00:04:27.300,spk_4,for not trying it on the
p4,00:04:27.300,00:04:29.920,spk_0,same indictment? I think because it gives notice of previous.
p4,00:04:32.520,00:04:36.560,spk_1,"Oh, I see. You would only be disqualified if you'd committed an offence. Yes, that's right My Lord."
p4,00:04:38.330,00:04:57.420,spk_2,"The reality was that if you're convicted of the other things, people then pled to this one because they were obviously driving and they couldn't dispute the fact that they were driving while disqualified. So it didn't actually add much to the length of the proceedings, the fact you had them on a, technically on a separate indictment, or the charges were separated."
p4,00:04:57.740,00:05:01.920,spk_0,"Yes, My Lords', [inaudible]."

p4,00:05:27.040,00:05:38.960,spk_0,"In relation to the principle submissions, I would make two observations, firstly, in relation to Section 29 (2) and, of course, association three and a reflection [inaudible]."
p4,00:05:39.640,00:05:43.050,spk_1,Yes.
p4,00:05:44.640,00:06:35.560,spk_0,"[Inaudible] important to remember what one's dealing with here is a single regulation system dealing with reservations rather than [inaudible], for example, the powers to [inaudible]. [Inaudible] solution was the most significant assistance that Your Lordships' can provide is this from [inaudible] of the 1928 government of Ireland, and in particular, as has been referred to already, the case of Hume which in our respectful submission runs closest to the considerations that [inaudible] appeals. In my respectful submission again, this was touched upon as simply a reference to written submissions in relation to the observations [inaudible]."

p4,00:07:22.320,00:07:32.160,spk_0,"mean? Well, having regard, obviously, to the attention to the Act, that's one factor. [Inaudible]"
p4,00:07:33.120,00:07:38.170,spk_3,"I'm sorry, My Lord. I'm sorry, you said to the intention of the Act, and you added words I did not"

Now, in the Canadian cases obviously what was -- and also, to an extent, in the Northern Irish cases, what was being considered was a choice between two competing purposes perhaps. And I have said that there can be different places for the same legislation or even provision of legislation but in my [inaudible] submission and properly at the legislation which one focuses upon here, the 2007 Act. [inaudible] reference to Section 45 (7), that in this section [inaudible] wants to have effect on the matters reserved because it is a [inaudible] to any act passed before the 2007 Act, that that was the intended effect, that the effect is clearly that reserve matters are effective, for example, the penalty provisions. And as a result, the intendment of legislation can be seen to have just that purpose. That being so, in my respectful submission and following the logic adopted in Hume, this is legislation which should be struck down."
p4,00:09:23.540,00:09:26.100,spk_3,"I'm completely lost, Mr Brown. I"
p4,00:09:26.100,00:09:27.950,spk_1,"mean,"
p4,00:09:27.960,00:09:36.460,spk_3,"the effect was precisely that presumed to that which was intended. I mean, everybody knew what was wanted, you wanted to increase the powers of the sheriff."
p4,00:09:37.440,00:09:37.620,spk_2,It
p4,00:09:37.620,00:09:47.160,spk_3,"didn't have any unintended effect, as far as one knows. Presumably, the sheriff started hearing cases that might otherwise have had to go for trial on indictment."
p4,00:09:47.940,00:10:15.450,spk_0,"Yes. This is why, My Lords', I talked about perhaps the distinctions of purpose. The purpose of the 2007 Act generally, might be understood having regard, for example, [inaudible] but looking to the provision Section 45 (7), [inaudible] the only other [inaudible] submission [inaudible] with intention to have effect to desired matters. Because it relates to all acts."
p4,00:10:15.840,00:10:33.030,spk_3,"Well, it would have been ludicrous to increase the powers of -- well, I mean, a view could be taken that it would be rather bizarre to increase the powers of the magistrate, but then say, oh terribly sorry, they can't do it in respect to some offences. Why would they want some either way offences? Why would they want to do"
p4,00:10:33.030,00:10:40.090,spk_0,"that? Because it is in line with the structure of the constitutional sentiment, and the sole matter is that [inaudible]."
p4,00:10:40.090,00:10:41.260,spk_3,"Well, that begs the question, I mean,"
p4,00:10:43.200,00:11:02.160,spk_1,"looking at it -- the generality of the provision, Subsection 7 is very apparent. When you look at the scope, there is no attempt to dissect one type of statute from another and the attempt is to achieve an overall readjustment of the jurisdiction of the sheriff in summary proceedings. Yes."
p4,00:11:02.640,00:11:09.370,spk_0,"Although in context, the Scottish provisions of the criminal law looking back to the previous provisions. Yes,"
p4,00:11:09.650,00:11:44.000,spk_1,"but you see, the reason why I put it this way, because I think the Advocate Deputy is going to say that when you look at the phrase, relates to reserve matters, you should -- I may be putting words in his mouth, wrongly construed that as relates to reserve matters only. Yes. And it doesn't do that because it's so broadly expressed. So it does bring in exactly the point Lord Brown is making, its across the board, and that makes one wonder whether we're not really in B at all. And we get into C and then all the qualifications that follow once you start to find your way through this more complicated"
p4,00:11:44.000,00:11:58.380,spk_0,"legislation. Well, I mean, that's a question to ask of interpretation [inaudible] the interpretation of the constitutional settlement should obviously be approached with particular care."
p4,00:11:58.390,00:11:59.750,spk_1,"Oh, yes."
p4,00:12:00.740,00:12:18.460,spk_0,And because of the potential to distort [inaudible]. And it's that distortion [inaudible] solution is perhaps [inaudible] loose language set up potentially by enacting provisions relating to [inaudible]. Yes.

p4,00:12:21.440,00:12:21.670,spk_0,But
p4,00:12:21.670,00:12:30.180,spk_1,"I think you'd agree wouldn't you, that the best guide to what the settlement was all about is to be found in the language of the act. So we have to follow through what the act is telling us."
p4,00:12:34.740,00:12:40.400,spk_0,"Absolutely, My Lord, that's why [inaudible], it was beyond simply the intention. One has to look beyond"
p4,00:12:40.400,00:12:41.180,spk_1,that [inaudible]
p4,00:12:43.740,00:12:46.250,spk_0,the effect [inaudible].

p4,00:12:59.290,00:13:11.460,spk_3,"in Scotland, the penalty goes up to two years imprisonment. I mean, I can see a point, I appreciate under Section 1265,"

And now you get this -- I mean you were quite a bad boy. I mean, why did you get -- I mean, it's an offence, which, in one sense, it doesn't admit of gradations. I mean, you're either driving while disqualified, or you're not. The gradations [inaudible] in sentencing. Yeah, I know, the question is, what is it that causes you to get -- why did you get seven months? Is it because you're a badly behaved boy, from all these other things? Well [inaudible]."

p4,00:14:55.740,00:15:22.860,spk_1,"So this is a plea of guilty, wasn't it? Yes. So you can't complain about the mode of trial, it's not as if you would say we wanted the protection of a jury or anything like that. So it's really -- your complaint is, by raising the threshold, you affect the mind of the sheriff. And as I think, Mr Shed was saying that when he looks at the range, he thinks you're looking at your list of previous convictions, you're near the top, you should go somewhere towards the top of the range now available. That is the point, is it? Yes, that is the point."
p4,00:15:23.540,00:16:02.930,spk_3,"Well, I mean, somebody could conduct --I don't understand them to have done so, a statistical survey, because, of course, undoubtedly fewer cases will be gay on indictment. So I mean you -- it's no good simply saying, of course, there are longer terms coming from Magistrates unless you can say, and that outweighs the shorter or the fewer turns imprisonment for the same offence coming out of the other courts, the superior courts. We simply don't know whether the overall impact has been to enlarge or reduce the number of people in prison [inaudible]. I'm sorry, My Lord, My Lordship's quite right [crosstalk]."

Yes. So, I mean, the thing is dissipated a little bit by the protection that's available at that level. The protection exists."
p4,00:17:19.189,00:17:38.500,spk_2,"It's very difficult to say, because, I mean, you've now got a situation where the legislation says that you get 12 months for an offence which, actually, is very difficult to commit in any different way.

[Inaudible] eventually progressed out of summary procedure into. And was this gentleman on his way to that situation? It doesn't -- he's got -- he's done it before, I see. His previous convictions are set out in six, seven and eight of the attendance [inaudible]. He's done it before, he's certainly done it a few times. It might have been well on the way, I think."

p4,00:18:34.060,00:18:57.660,spk_1,"Yes. They tend to run together. Yes. [Crosstalk]. My point really would be, if the appeal [inaudible] court were confronted with somebody for whom this was the first offence, and they found he was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, they might think quite readily, that was rather excessive. And so the gradation point is something that can be perfectly well argued at that level."
p4,00:18:59.040,00:19:10.450,spk_0,"Yes, it's hard to say without having looked at the record again. Having had [inaudible] previous regime, I would have expected [inaudible]."

p4,00:19:54.140,00:20:02.360,spk_3,"of taking a view as to whether this chap would or wouldn't have been tried on indictment previously, it's a bit -- astonishing approach. [Inaudible]."
p4,00:20:03.440,00:20:18.470,spk_2,"But you are, Mr Brown, because -- one says you are because you are saying, I thought you were saying a minute ago that, you know, you thought that he would never have got seven months. I expressed that. So he would never have been tried on indictment. No."
p4,00:20:22.440,00:20:36.270,spk_0,[Inaudible] but the fact that there is effect on the summary sentence provision. That is the essence of my respectful submission. The purpose of Section 45 that is the nub of the appeal.

p4,00:20:39.840,00:20:52.670,spk_3,"The effect may be because nobody's done any study of it that actually there are significantly fewer going on indictment. And the overall result is lower, not higher sentences. I mean, we simply don't know."
p4,00:20:56.240,00:20:58.910,spk_2,"I won't be lower, I don't see why it could be lower."

There is a clear difference between making modifications of the Scots criminals in question in order to achieve consistency in the way it applies to devolved matters and making modifications in reserve matters in order to achieve consistency between the reserved matter and Scots criminal law in question. The order makes modifications in reserve matters in order to achieve consistency [inaudible] criminal pressure oppression is clearly [inaudible] and related to reserve matter, and the point I simply make My Lords', is given the context of Scotland, 29(4) is not there to achieve consistency by changing the reserved matter so that [inaudible]."

And is it directing attention to a situation where you have, as I think you're putting it, well, the law in question would be the previous sentencing power of the sheriff. Yes. Which is the subject matter of the amendment. Yes. And you're saying, well, if you look at that, it isn't actually the case that it was applying inconsistently between reserved and non-reserved matters because again, as we can see it, it's across the board, is that right? The sentencing power was equivalent, whether it was a Scottish statute or a UK statute, and that's really the essential plank I think of this part of the argument, is that right? Yes."

p4,00:25:03.170,00:25:16.840,spk_2,"I mean, it's putting up the ordinary Scot -- it's putting up Scots law jurisdiction, and why is it not trying to keep two things in line making it consistent? [Inaudible] that's the principal point, one cannot alter  a reserved matter to accommodate [inaudible]"

So that's something that is a modification that's being made to Scott's criminal law. And what is being done in order to achieve consistency in treatment between the application of that Scottish statutes, which are not reserved and reserved ones, is to bring them all in together so that you've got consistency right across the board.

p4,00:40:34.610,00:41:17.930,spk_4,"and then in Part 2, I propose to make submissions in relation to the Scotland Act and its application to this particular piece of legislation. But perhaps I can introduce my submissions by making a remark or two on what My Lords' have heard so far. In my submission, the fallacy at the root of the appellant's submission is the proposition that it is somehow illegitimate for the Scottish Parliament to modify the law on reserved matters."
p4,00:41:24.910,00:41:28.730,spk_1,I don't think the proposition was quite as bold as that.
p4,00:41:28.730,00:42:44.820,spk_4,"It wasn't put perhaps that starkly My Lord, but in my submission, in essence, that is what the submission comes to, that we have here an amendment to a reserved statute or a statute subject matter of which is reserved. And if the burden of the submission was that there was something surprising or illegitimate about that, then  in my submission, that would be misconceived. And that's perfectly playing from the terms of Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 4, which tell us in terms, that modification of the law on reserved matters is provided. It satisfies certain tests set out in the legislation perfectly legitimate and indeed, in my submission, may well be expected in circumstances where the parliament is effecting legislative reform within its proper province."
p4,00:42:47.300,00:43:00.010,spk_1,"But do you accept that ultimately the best guide for us is the wording of the statute. We can't, as it were, take some sort of broad policy view for ourselves about where the boundary would lie."
p4,00:43:00.020,00:44:03.810,spk_4,"Indeed, My Lord, I accept that one is concerned in relation to the issues around the Scotland Act with a question of interpretation. And that is a question of understanding or making sense of the words used in their proper context. Now it is my submission that, part of the context here and part of the context in which parliament has used the words that it has used, and enacted the provisions that it has enacted, is our major piece of constitutional reform.  And in my submission, what Parliament has done and can be understood as doing when one analyses the provisions, is that Parliament was recognised, first of all, that human affairs don't respect the best efforts of the legislative draughtsman."
p4,00:44:08.890,00:44:09.970,spk_3,Just say that again [all laugh].
p4,00:44:09.980,00:45:13.420,spk_4,"human human affairs don't respect the best efforts of the legislative draughtsman. And by that, My Lord, I mean that however, the draughtsman may seek to encapsulate particular subject matters in certain forms of words in practice, particularly when one is dealing with programmes of legislation, things are not that tidy and it's, the second thing that in my submission these provisions recognise is that effective legislation for the Scottish Parliament effectively to legislate in areas in which it is expected to legislate it may require to modify the law and reserved matters and to do things which are applied to reserve matters. And of course, the third thing which the statute does is that it seeks to"

And the Draughtsman is trying to make allowance for that in various ways that are spelled out -- indeed -- that's his attempt to meet the problem that you referred to of human affairs, not respecting precise boundaries-- indeed My Lord --"
p4,00:45:53.290,00:46:10.910,spk_4,"I made those remarks simply in order, perhaps, to set some sort of context for the words that are used by the Draughtsman. But I accept entirely My Lords' that  proposition that one is concerned here with the question of interpretation of the statutory provisions."

p4,00:46:24.480,00:47:09.350,spk_4,"Quite happy to take it that way around My Lord. What I was going to do was to take My Lords' to Section 45 in the background to that, because I suspect that My Lords' have clearly got the point. But at certain points in the submissions that have been advanced, there was, perhaps a flavour of the notion that what Section 45 was about is increasing sentences --Doing what?-- It was about increasing  sentences and in my submission, that simply was not the policy of this particular section, not the purpose which it was."
p4,00:47:09.360,00:47:21.400,spk_3,"I understood, Mr Brown, to say that exactly the same argument would apply. In fact, that it had been to reduce the powers of the share which I thought was made it pretty [inaudible]."
p4,00:47:21.620,00:47:28.300,spk_1,"I think you're going to say that actually, it a rather wider purpose. It's not about levels of sentences so much as the organisation of the court system."
p4,00:47:28.310,00:47:53.590,spk_4,"Absolutely, My Lord. And in my submission, the purpose of this provision was to enable offences which otherwise would have been prosecuted on indictment to be prosecuted in the summary courts as part of a reform of the administration of justice in Scotland. The purpose was not to increase the sentence in any particular case"
p4,00:47:53.600,00:48:02.400,spk_3,"Anymore than the converse would have been if it had been decided, more of these cases should be heard on indictment with a reduced sentencing"
p4,00:48:03.500,00:48:28.790,spk_4,"Indeed My Lord. And perhaps I could just again by [inaudible] And while it's in my mind, make three observations in relation to certain of what Mr Brown said, it's perhaps worth keeping in mind that the sentencing Judge in relation to these matters is the same sentencing Judge who would be dealing with the matter if it was tried on indictment."
p4,00:48:29.470,00:48:29.730,spk_0,"Because,"
p4,00:48:29.730,00:48:53.370,spk_4,"of course, if we're dealing with cases that, if we're dealing with a charge which would previously have been brought on indictment, it would have been brought an indictment in the Sheriff Court before a Sheriff sitting with a jury, and the sentence would have been imposed by the same professional Judge as imposes the sentence under the reform of"
p4,00:48:53.370,00:48:54.790,spk_0,legislation. So
p4,00:48:54.790,00:49:01.160,spk_4,"that's the first safeguard in relation to the point that Mr Brown is making. The second is, of course, the Appeal Court"
p4,00:49:01.170,00:49:09.430,spk_2,"Just,  there's been no pushing down to the to the District court of these events"
p4,00:49:10.770,00:49:30.270,spk_4,"The jurisdiction of the District Court, as I understand it remains the same. In fact, the District Court is being replaced by a new institution called the J P Court. But as I understand it, the sentencing in Paragraph's (7) is regards imprisonment and not changing in relation to that court."
p4,00:49:31.390,00:49:38.900,spk_2,This offence can't go down to the JP court or can it?
p4,00:49:39.770,00:49:41.160,spk_4,"Well, it certainly couldn't."
p4,00:49:41.210,00:49:42.280,spk_1,It
p4,00:49:42.280,00:49:43.700,spk_4,couldn't attract a sentence.
p4,00:49:43.950,00:49:46.720,spk_2,No. What's the maximum for JPs now?
p4,00:49:46.790,00:49:49.490,spk_4,60 days I think
p4,00:49:50.570,00:49:50.930,spk_2,60 days
p4,00:49:50.930,00:50:26.070,spk_4,"Of course what has also happened under this particular body of reforms is that the the 2007 Act has also introduced new forms of alternative disposals. That's alternative prosecution, and has modified the previous law and alternative disposals so that they are much more, much more uses to be made of alternatives prosecution so that cases which had previously been prosecuted in the summary court are now not prosecuted at all"
p4,00:50:26.860,00:50:51.610,spk_1,"I wonder whether it would be helpful if you could do it very briefly just to give an idea of the background. Because a lot of what you're saying really depends on the knowledge of what it was that gave rise to Section 45. There's a lot of material in the bundles. I'm sure you can do it very briefly, but if you could just give us a feel for where the thinking began and why it was, this section emerged, that would be very helpful."
p4,00:50:52.420,00:50:58.190,spk_4,Yes My Lord

p4,00:51:02.520,00:51:34.380,spk_4,"The starting point on the particular issue in Section 45 will be the report of the Summary Justice Review Committee under the chairmanship of Sheriff Principal John Mclnnes. That was a committee My Lord's, which was given a remit to look at the whole structure and system of Summary Justice in Scotland. And I'll look at the document in a moment and which made far reaching proposals for reform of the system of Summary Justice in Scotland."
p4,00:51:36.060,00:51:36.390,spk_0,"Okay,"
p4,00:51:37.060,00:52:07.380,spk_4,"one of the proposals of that committee among many, was that the sentencing powers of the Sheriff when sitting in the Summary Court should be increased, but should be increased not with a view to increasing the penalty for individual cases, but so that cases which could previously have been tried on indictment and couldn't have been heard in the Summary Court could be prosecuted in the Summary Court."
p4,00:52:08.550,00:52:10.470,spk_0,There is a body of jurisprudence in

p4,00:52:36.660,00:53:02.770,spk_4,"There was no increase in the maximum sentence -- quite appreciated -- that's the key point. Perhaps My Lord's, by way of what I proposed to do is take My Lords' relatively efficiently to the Mclnnes Report and the subsequent history of this particular provision. It might be helpful to have Section 45 before My Lords', before I do that"

p4,00:53:51.520,00:54:23.860,spk_4,"Section 43 My Lord, this is the section that My Lords have just been looking at, which deals with Common Law Offences, now of course, Common Law Offences, in relation to Common Law Offences, there is no statutory maximum penalty when the common Law Offence prosecuted on indictment. So there is no increase in the maximum penalty that may be imposed in relation to a Common Law Offence simply by increasing the powers of the Sheriff in Summary proceedings"
p4,00:54:30.440,00:54:30.670,spk_2,
p4,00:54:31.970,00:55:13.560,spk_4,"And then Section 45 deals with offences which can be prosecuted either way, so offences which could be prosecuted on indictment and therefore which could attract a penalty if prosecuted by that mode higher than that which would be available on Summary Prosecution. And in some cases, we happen to have an offence here where the maximum on indictment was 12 months. But in many cases, statutory offences triable either way, the maximum penalty on indictment is higher than 12 months."
p4,00:55:13.920,00:55:14.630,spk_0,Is it
p4,00:55:14.630,00:55:26.190,spk_1,"effective Section 45 (2) to increase sentences in any any cases? Obviously it doesn't here, but it looks as though it's raising the level generally across all statutory offences."

I wouldn't like to say that there is none such, but I haven't identified one. There are offences where on indictment, only a fine is available. But of course that's not affected by by this"

p4,00:55:54.640,00:56:06.400,spk_4,"And as we'll see when we look at the legislative material, it certainly wasn't the policy purpose to increase the sentence in any matter."
p4,00:56:06.570,00:56:10.750,spk_1,I'm not sure whether that fits with Subsection (3) which gives powers to the

p4,00:56:32.630,00:57:49.950,spk_4,"That provides the power for making such a change. But it's not, and perhaps that has to be read along with the provisions of Section 44 which do increase, Section 44 does increase the maximum penalty available for a small number of specific offences and the thinking behind, I should say, My Lord, that there are many statutory offences which are prosecutable only in Summary Courts which are not affected by Section 44, and where the maximum penalty remains less than 12 months. Section 44 deals with a small number of offences and my understanding is that they are offences, where under the previous law, they attracted a penalty larger than the maximum otherwise available in the Summary Court. And it was thought anomalous that they should become offences which attracted a penalty lower than the maximum having regard to the particular nature of these offences, so those are particular offences, but there is no across-the-board increasing of summary offence."
p4,00:57:49.950,00:57:57.750,spk_2,"So its not the case that all Summary, all such offences now attract 12 months."
p4,00:57:58.230,00:58:33.380,spk_4,"It's not, as I understand it My Lord, and of course that's because there are offences, the policy purposes to allow cases that could have been prosecuted on indictment to be prosecuted in the Summary Courts, it would be quite wrong to simply increase the sentences for offences which can be prosecuted only in the Summary Courts and where the existing maximum is less than 12 months. Now that's been done for a small number of specific offences but has not been done across-the-board."

It's far from particular to the Road Traffic Act. And indeed, in my submission, it isn't.

p5,00:05:48.210,00:05:59.240,spk_1,"Or indeed procedure. And in my submission, the definition does not require one to select any particular item from the list,"
p5,00:05:59.250,00:06:23.050,spk_4,"but it does help. It may be important in a way of trying to understand what the purpose is and whether it is a special provision or whether it's a general provision. These are things one is having to consider when you go back over Section 29 of the Schedule. If it's penalties, that's rather specific. But I rather thought the McInnes report was looking at aspects of procedure and jurisdiction."
p5,00:06:23.530,00:06:57.930,spk_1,"That's true My Lord, and perhaps I could, yes, it certainly, it's certain, this provision certainly deals with jurisdiction, and it deals with procedure. I have to accept it's dealing with penalties, but it's dealing with not with the penalty for a particular offence, but the penalty available in a particular mode of trial which might be seen to be."
p5,00:06:57.940,00:07:13.060,spk_4,"It's not attempting, as we saw, although there is a risk of sentence drift, it's not the aim of the thing to affect sentence levels. It's more concerned with the procedure under which the Judge, the Sheriff, I should say, determines the penalty."
p5,00:07:13.070,00:07:15.960,spk_1,It is. It's about a reallocation of business.
p5,00:07:20.820,00:07:21.920,spk_4,"Yes, thank you."
p5,00:07:22.820,00:07:46.210,spk_1,But I would I hope it's not unhelpful to say that I would resist the view that a particular provision necessarily has to be particularly characterised under one of the heads. The point is that 1265 is plainly intended to be a broad and all-encompassing provision.
p5,00:08:01.830,00:08:05.580,spk_4,"Well, that was the first point I think you were going to mention this extra 45(3)?"

p5,00:10:23.360,00:10:55.250,spk_1,"And so that 48 is the equivalent in relation to monetary penalties of Section 43, and so far as Section, turning to Section 47. What that provision does is that in effect mirrors Section 45 by telling us that the maximum fine to which a person is liable on summary conviction of a relevant"

I should say that the jurisdiction, I'm told the Section 103(1)(b) would not be prosecuted, prosecutable, in the District, in the Justice, in the JP Court for the District Court. But there is an interesting effect of the creation of the JP Court, which is, if one goes to Section 10 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act which My Lords have in volume 8 tab 104."

My Lords will see, notwithstanding anything in any enactment or rule of law to the contrary, a District Court in Scotland may try any fixed penalty offence and another category offence, of offence. Now, the 2007 Act substitutes the words Justice of the Peace Court for District Court. Yeah. And that's Paragraph 7 of the Schedule to the 2007 Act. And I suppose perhaps I can make this point that it would be very peculiar if, as in the context of a reform of the administration of justice in Scotland, in effect, parallel systems had to be kept in place in order to deal with different categories of events. While My Lords have in front of them or perhaps close to hand Section, Tab 78 in Volume 6."

Now a stipendiary magistrate is, sits in the District Court or the JP Court, but he has the jurisdiction of a Sheriff. Yeah. He's a professional Judge. As I understand it, that particular mechanism is used only in Glasgow. [Background noise]. While we're looking at those provisions, it may be worth noticing that"

p5,00:18:24.020,00:18:58.330,spk_1,"Well, it's simply and of course, it's entirely consistent with the Advocate General's position that the United Kingdom plainly has no difficulty with the notion that this provision applies to reserve matters. And it perhaps suffices just to notice in the UK borders at 2007, Section 42(5), where a maximum sentence is imposed, but only until Section 45 of the 2007 Act is commenced."
p5,00:19:04.810,00:19:08.190,spk_4,"So that's 42, 42(5)(c)."
p5,00:19:16.640,00:21:25.500,spk_1,"Just again on some matters of information, which were raised with me yesterday, on the question of statistics My Lords, a question had been asked in relation to the cases, which in the Summary Courts have resulted in a sentence of more than six months being imposed since this Act came into force and the statistics for the period, and My Lords should recall that the Act came into force on the 10th of December 2007. The 2008-2009 statistics are still in the process of being compiled and will not be available until, I'm told, until March of next year. And for the period from December '07 to March '08 for which statistics might have been expected to be available. Apparently, the sentences over six months were coded in the system wrongly as unfair proceedings on indictment because the statisticians have not caught up with the legislative change. So that's the reason why I'm afraid I have no hard information to provide to My Lord Roger, in particular, I think who raised that point. So far as the question of a sentence, the sentencing Commission is concerned. I think I, perhaps along with others, had in mind, legislation currently going through the Scottish Parliament to create a Sentencing Council. Right. There was a Sentencing Commission which was set up originally under the chairmanship of Lord MacLean and subsequently under the chairmanship of the late Lord Macfadyen, in 2003, which had a remit to review and make recommendations on a variety of matters, including the scope for improving the consistency in sentencing. And indeed, it was a as a result of the report of that Commission that the proposals for a Sentencing Council are now before the Scottish Parliament."
p5,00:21:25.510,00:21:28.360,spk_4,"So the Commission, does a Commission still exist? No. It"
p5,00:21:28.370,00:21:33.080,spk_1,"dissolved, it exhausted its remit in November 2006 and is now dissolved."
p5,00:21:33.090,00:21:43.190,spk_4,"I'm sure Lord Browne would correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the English position is that there is a Sentencing Commission and a Sentencing Council. I believe there is too, and they have different functions."
p5,00:21:44.070,00:21:48.290,spk_3,I believe there actually should only be one. I think they contemplate
p5,00:21:49.100,00:21:49.540,spk_4,trying
p5,00:21:49.540,00:21:52.740,spk_3,to either merge or unify this.
p5,00:21:52.780,00:22:02.660,spk_4,"Yes, anyway, thank you very much. So it's a Sentencing Council that is the subject of legislation under consideration following a consultation"
p5,00:22:02.660,00:22:30.720,spk_1,"process. The only other point of clarification arising from yesterday is, I think My Lords asked Mr Shed if there had been any amendment to the relevant part of the Road Traffic Offenders Act Section 103(1)(b) and I would simply point My Lords to the print of that act at tab 10 of Miller's core bundle, and it may not be necessary to look at it. I simply note that the provision for penalty points had been amended."

p5,00:23:16.960,00:24:06.490,spk_1,"My Lord in the chair yesterday asked me whether there was any particular approach, I think, to be taken in relation to the interpretation of this Act.

p5,00:24:22.320,00:24:35.480,spk_4,Mine seems to be in the right order. Is it just at Page 518? Or do we have to look more widely?
p5,00:24:35.480,00:26:39.060,spk_1,"It's at page 518. It's just a short passage where under reference to the Government of Ireland Act, Viscount Simmons about two-thirds of the way down the page. Well, perhaps I can take it from just above halfway. The point here was whether a piece of planning legislation could be, by virtue of the restrictions that were imposed, treated as taking, basically taking property without compensation. And just about halfway, his Lordship says for My Lords, I would hereby point out that if such restrictions cannot be enforced without the payment of compensation, the practical effect must be to deprive the Parliament of Northern Ireland at the power to legislate not only in this particular field in a manner that recognised as necessary to its proper fulfilment in Great Britain, but in numerous other fields also in which it has been widely realised, the rights of the individual must be subordinate to the general interest. And then a little further down, he says, This is right however, that in the interpretation of constitutional instruments. Guidance should be sought from those courts whose constant duty it has been to construe similar instruments, if only because, as it appears to me, a flexibility of construction is admissible in regard to such instruments, which might be rejected in construing ordinary statutes or inter partes documents. Now, My Lords, I don't particularly invite this Court to look widely at decisions on other constitutional instruments because one of the peculiarities of the Scotland Act is, it tells us in Section 29(3) how to go about the process of deciding whether a piece of legislation relates to a reserved matter or not. But I thought I should draw My Lords attention to the reference, to the for a [inaudible] flexibility of construction in relation to instruments"

p5,00:27:03.890,00:27:47.350,spk_1,"Indeed, My Lord, and it goes back to the point that I perhaps put rather haltingly yesterday at the outset of my submissions. That part of the purpose of this legislation is to create an effective and workable set of institutions with the capacity and power to legislate provided, of course, that they respect properly the restrictions on their competence. And that point, which I tried to make rather haltingly yesterday, was perhaps put rather more elegantly by Lord Porter in a case which is in volume 5 at tab 62."

Well, I think there is, I will make a submission to My Lords that 29(4) applies to, is directed to provisions which modify the criminal law as it applies to reserve matters, but not provisions which modify the criminal law generally. But I'm quite happy to, on the, also take the fall back, if you like, that part of the purpose of this provision is to make the law apply consistently to both reserved and non-reserved matters."
p5,00:33:24.900,00:33:39.730,spk_4,"That's why I was raising with you the fact that on the face of it, it does appear to extend to Acts of the Scottish Parliament as well. It doesn't make a distinction, of course. And somewhere in the proposition it perhaps ought to go in."
p5,00:33:39.740,00:34:09.330,spk_1,"I can see that My Lord, perhaps I should try again. The purpose of Section 45 is to increase the sentencing powers of the Sheriff sitting as a court of summary jurisdiction and thereby affect a reallocation of business within the court structure. And to do so, irrespective of whether the offence in question, it is a reserved matter or an non-reserved matter"
p5,00:34:18.909,00:34:20.580,spk_3,is or is not a reserve matter?
p5,00:34:20.590,00:34:24.740,spk_4,"Yes, right. Well,"

p5,00:34:33.800,00:35:20.460,spk_1,"Yes. What was an issue here was a piece of provincial legislation, dealing with money lenders and imposing a restriction on the recoverable sum. Now, the money lenders in question had taken promissory notes ensued on the promissory notes and were met with the restriction under provincial legislation. Promissory notes were exclusively for the Federation, and so an issue arose, which was addressed by Lord Porter at Pages 41 to 43."
p5,00:35:20.460,00:35:21.330,spk_4,[Background noise].
p5,00:35:27.690,00:37:48.290,spk_1,"And at the bottom of page 42, His Lordship said against the argument that as soon as you were dealing with something in the, as it were, reserved field, the legislation fell to be treated as invalid. And at the bottom of the page, His Lordship says to take such a view is to simplify unduly the task of distinguishing the powers, the divided jurisdictions, is not possible to make so cleaner cut between the powers of the various legislatures. They're bound to overlap from time to time. Moreover, the British Parliament when enacting the Indian Constitution Act had a long experience of the working of the British North America Act and the Australian Commonwealth Act and must have known it does not impact as possible to ensure powers and trusted several legislatures, will never overlap and then down towards the bottom of Page 43 he says, But the overlapping of subject matter is not avoided by substituting three lists for two, or even by arranging for a hierarchy of jurisdictions. Subjects must still overlap. And where they do, the question must be asked. And in that context, what input and substances effectively enactment of which complaint has been made and what can be found if these questions could not be asked, much beneficent legislation would be stifled at birth, and many of the subjects entrusted to provincial legislation could never effectively be dealt with. My Lord, in my submission, the purpose test was intended, purpose test was intended precisely to secure that the powers of the Scottish Parliament would not be unduly restricted or stifled because if by reference to the purpose of the provisions, it does not relate to reserve matter then for the purposes of Section 29(2)(b) any impact on reserve matters is neither here nor there."
p5,00:37:49.840,00:38:16.430,spk_3,"I'd just like to consider what you do say about 29(4). I mean, what you say is that 29(4)(b) only obtains if the modifications to the criminal law, only apply to reserved matters, you say, if they apply here across the board, then you don't you're not through the (4)(b) gate. Is that what you say?"
p5,00:38:16.440,00:38:18.270,spk_1,That's my primary submission.
p5,00:38:18.270,00:38:19.560,spk_3,"Yes, well, I mean, let's just see"
p5,00:38:19.600,00:38:20.470,spk_2,how
p5,00:38:20.470,00:38:21.970,spk_3,"that works. I mean,"
p5,00:38:21.980,00:38:23.410,spk_1,I. Maybe
p5,00:38:23.410,00:38:24.240,spk_3,there be something in it
p5,00:38:24.240,00:38:26.360,spk_2,because only
p5,00:38:26.360,00:38:53.250,spk_3,"then, on the face of it, does it really make sense to say, Well, what you all then doing is okay, so long as it's just simply to secure consistency? Whereas if it applies anyway to more than reserved matters, you almost by then begged the question you've already, as it's applying more generally than merely to reserve matters. Inevitably, there's a consistency built in, so you don't add anything."
p5,00:38:53.260,00:39:56.770,spk_1,"Well, indeed, My Lord and perhaps I can illustrate what in my submission, this provision is about in this way, and My Lords were troubled by the connection between the provisions in Schedule 4 and what this provision is dealing with. Schedule 4 is about making modifications to the law on reserved matters. So if one keeps that in one's mind and then asks, what does one thinking about when one has a provision which would otherwise not relate to reserve matters but makes modifications of Scot's private law, of Scots Criminal Law and which applies, and let's take it this way, and which applies to reserve matters. Let's take the example of the ordinary law criminal procedure. Now, if you have a reserved offence, the expectation will be that the ordinary law of criminal procedure, which is plainly not a reserve matter, doesn't relate to reserve matters, will govern the prosecution of the reserve defence."
p5,00:39:56.780,00:40:06.070,spk_3,"You might suddenly have some change as to hearsay rules which is going to apply driving whilst disqualified, equal or everything else. Okay, so"
p5,00:40:06.080,00:40:28.270,spk_1,"yes, but what this would prevent the Scottish Parliament from doing is amending the rules of criminal procedure specifically in order to make some special provision for reserved matters unless the purpose was to make the law in question apply consistently to reserve matters and otherwise."
p5,00:40:28.560,00:40:37.400,spk_4,"If you had an alteration to the rule especially designed to apply only to the Road Traffic Act that would be outside the boundary, would it?"
p5,00:40:37.410,00:41:00.040,spk_1,"Well, one is always caused, because one need to look at every measure on its merits. But if one were contemplating a provision which was targeted, as it were, targeted on a reserve matter in that way, then that's the sort of provision in my submission that Section 29(4) is concerned with."
p5,00:41:00.050,00:41:00.830,spk_3,But would be be uncertain --
p5,00:41:01.710,00:41:02.300,spk_4,no please go on.
p5,00:41:02.300,00:41:16.980,spk_3,"But that would be okay so long as, until you made that modification, it had been different in respect to the reserve matter from everything else, and you're changing it in order to regularise it, to make it uniform across the board."
p5,00:41:16.990,00:41:18.110,spk_1,"Indeed, My Lord."
p5,00:41:18.110,00:41:33.170,spk_3,"So I mean, if you had a rule, say you couldn't use, I don't know, hearsay evidence in respect of driving whilst disqualified, you could for everything else. Well, then you could eliminate that anomaly. And that would be compliant with 29(4)."
p5,00:41:33.180,00:41:48.450,spk_1,"Is that what you're saying? Indeed My Lord. The Advocate general puts the underlying policy between, behind, this provision in his written case, paragraph 17"
p5,00:41:48.460,00:41:49.890,spk_3,to
p5,00:41:49.900,00:41:51.860,spk_1,19 in particular.
p5,00:41:51.870,00:41:53.730,spk_4,
p5,00:41:54.720,00:41:54.790,spk_2,
p5,00:41:54.790,00:42:01.780,spk_4,Davis could find this? Could you give the paragraph again? 17 did you say?
p5,00:42:01.790,00:42:04.380,spk_1,"Paragraphs 17, 18 and 19."
p5,00:42:11.620,00:42:16.290,spk_4,"Well, he's, yes, he's dealing with section 29(4) here."
p5,00:42:16.300,00:43:49.990,spk_1,"He's dealing in section 29(4), and he tells us the provision addresses two competing concerns. On the hand, section 29(4) is a restriction on the powers of the Scottish Parliament to modify the laws that applies to reserve matters, on the other hand, it allows for such modification if its purpose is to make Scots private law, Scots criminal law apply consistently to reserve in other matters. Accordingly, it's both a restriction on the powers of the Scottish Parliament and an enabling provision to allow for such modification of its purpose is to make Scots private or criminal law apply consistently to both reserved and devolved matters. This means that reforms of Scott's private and Scott's criminal law do not have to be artificially limited to avoid making provision as it applies to reserve matters, so long as the provisions concerned applies consistently to devolved and reserved matters, thus preserving the unity of Scots law. Section 29(4) is set against a background where common law crime, a good deal of statutory crime, is not reserved, although there is also a significant body of statutory crime which is reserved. Section 29(4) avoids the need to create parallel laws on basic areas of reserved and devolved Scots criminal and private law, for instance, it could otherwise be argued that such matters as general principles of criminal law, jurisdiction, the system of criminal courts, evidence, procedure and sentencing, were all devolved only so far as they related to substantive non-reserved defences, and reserves far as related to substantial reserve offences, all these matters accordingly would require parallel legislation of the United Kingdom Parliament and if the Scottish Parliament. Such duplication would be undesirable, but also two differences in approach could lead to the fragmentation of Scots law. Section 29(4) allows for this to be avoided."
p5,00:43:50.000,00:44:14.930,spk_4,"So the spectre that is raised there, and is answered really, is having to design Section 45, for example, in such a way that it's expressly limited to devolved legislation, and then having to go to the Westminster Parliament to pronounce, or to enact, an exactly equivalent provisions which would be designed to deal with reserved matters."
p5,00:44:14.940,00:44:42.700,spk_1,"Well, indeed. And of course, one must bear in mind the practicalities here that officials who are, and experts in matters of criminal procedure in Scotland, are located in the Scottish administration, and not although plainly, the Advocate General has a body of expertise to draw upon, the policy makers in this field are in Edinburgh rather than in London."
p5,00:44:42.900,00:44:57.950,spk_4,"The other solution, which I believe has been adopted from time to time, is to cut the Gordian knot by just sending everything off to Westminster and have them dealt with there, but that doesn't seem to fit very well with the idea of these matters being dealt with in the Scottish Parliament."
p5,00:44:57.960,00:45:26.730,spk_1,"Well, indeed, My Lord, and just to go on at Paragraph 19 of the Advocate General's submission, section 29(4) enables the Scottish Parliament to legislate across reserve and other areas of law, provided the purpose of the provisions to make the law apply consistently, to reserve matters and otherwise, thus the coherence of the Scots law can be preserved. But the Scottish Parliament cannot stray beyond that purpose to make special, distinctive, provisions in relation to, for instance, the reserve matters of financial services or consumer protection."
p5,00:45:28.210,00:45:29.090,spk_0,But is that the same point you're making? No. I think it's different --
p5,00:45:31.320,00:45:33.100,spk_1,"It's a, he he he --"
p5,00:45:33.110,00:45:34.500,spk_0,"it's quite different, with respect."
p5,00:45:34.740,00:45:35.230,spk_1,"Your,"
p5,00:45:35.240,00:46:11.410,spk_0,"your contention, as I understood, unless I mistake it is, you find a section which is out of line with everything else, and then you use this in order to bring it into line. But as I understand what the Advocate General is arguing, he's arguing, Well that's what we've got here, in other words. That you put the whole, you try to update and reform the whole of the law of Scotland, the criminal law of Scotland, and this power allows you to do it without needing to go to Westminster to have a little bit done for reserved matters, which is a different proposition, unless I'm mistaken, from your proposition?"
p5,00:46:11.420,00:46:19.870,spk_1,"Well, I agree with, I agree that the Scottish Parliament should have the power to make across the board reform."
p5,00:46:20.720,00:46:27.100,spk_0,"I am glad you agree, but the question is how do you fit, I mean, what's your submission? I don't understand how you get that from your submission?"
p5,00:46:28.560,00:47:08.750,spk_3,"I mean your case is that you don't get into 4 because this isn't a modification of Scots criminal law as it applies to reserve matters. Indeed My Lord. Because it applies not only to reserve. So you say, You've got to read 4(b), as if it says, Applies only to reserve matters. Indeed My Lord. But the Advocate General would appear to take a contrary view, but say, even assuming as he does and it appears that it applies to all, whether or not reserve matters, It's still satisfied here for the very reason that it's applying across the board."
p5,00:47:08.760,00:47:54.120,spk_1,"Well, indeed, My Lord, I pointed My Lords to the Advocate General submission partly because I detect he takes a different approach on, or may take a different approach, on this subsection. But, in my submission, the way he puts the policy, particularly in Paragraph 19, is quite, perhaps helpful, that what one is concerned about is to the Scottish Parliament should not be making specific targeted legislation directed to reserve matters. Now I say that the way one gets to that is simply by reading B in the way that my Lord Brown has articulated --"
p5,00:47:55.550,00:48:31.040,spk_0,"I'm not sure there's all that much between you on this point. Because if you start off with the status quo being that there is consistency in the sentencing powers of a sheriff sitting in a summary court, the question really comes down to, Does the Scottish Parliament, first of all, have to pass one lot of legislation dealing with the sentencing powers when it's a reserve matter, and then, six months later, say, Oh Look, now it's inconsistent, We've got to achieve consistency, or can it do it in one go? It's really as simple as that, isn't it?"
p5,00:48:31.050,00:48:35.520,spk_1,"Well, I would hope the Advocate General and I would agree that they can do it in one go."
p5,00:48:35.530,00:48:37.970,spk_0,Well the Advocate general certainly does and I hope you [crosstalk] --
p5,00:48:39.200,00:49:02.150,spk_1,"Well that's also certainly my submission, but it a question of how one, it may be a question of just how one approaches that on the Section 29(4), I mean, I say that one isn't in 29(4) because this is, makes modifications of Scots criminal law generally, and not as it applies to reserve matters."
p5,00:49:02.150,00:49:26.060,spk_4,"I'd like to take you back to Section 29(2)(b) because that's the first thing you come to and you were dealing with it yesterday. And I think, but I'd like to be absolutely sure about this. That you say that (2)(b) when read with 3 only applies where it is clear that the purpose of the measure is to deal with reserve matters."
p5,00:49:26.100,00:49:27.540,spk_1,"My Lord, as purpose relates to reserve matters."
p5,00:49:27.550,00:49:55.800,spk_4,"Reserve matters, and that's purely and simple reserve matters only, is that right? The word only isn't actually there, but is that what you are submitting, so that you get beyond (b) in a case such as we're dealing with here, you say, and that's why we're really concerned with subsection 4, in this case. But I need to be quite sure how you get past the stark prohibition in 29(2)(b)?"
p5,00:49:55.810,00:50:08.030,spk_1,"Yes, I get past the stark prohibition because I say the purpose of this, having regard to the purpose of this provision, it does not relate to reserve matters."
p5,00:50:10.700,00:50:28.200,spk_4,"Because? Of the point you made to Lord Brown earlier, is it? That if you look at the purpose, you say the purpose is to increase the sentencing powers and thereby affect a reallocation of business in the court structure. Yes, indeed."
p5,00:50:28.530,00:50:48.440,spk_1,"And, I, of course, immediately accept that the legislation has some effects on reserved matters, such as these particular provisions of the Road Traffic Act, but that does not, that does not, in my submission, lead one to conclude that it relates to reserve matters."
p5,00:50:48.440,00:50:50.550,spk_0,It's really an interpretation of relates to --
p5,00:50:50.560,00:50:51.790,spk_1,It's about what relates to.
p5,00:50:51.790,00:50:52.350,spk_0,Yes. that's what's critical.
p5,00:50:52.940,00:51:12.570,spk_1,"Absolutely, My Lord, and I point to Schedule 4, which is built on the hypothesis that one can amend, modify the law on reserved matters without the provision thereby being treated as relating to reserve matters."
p5,00:51:12.580,00:51:17.590,spk_4,"and to understand, relate to, you look to the pith and substance do you of? --"
p5,00:51:17.880,00:51:21.130,spk_0,"Sorry, you also looked at 29(3), don't you?"
p5,00:51:21.770,00:51:22.580,spk_4,Yes of course. 29(3)
p5,00:51:22.580,00:51:27.390,spk_0,"is spelling out the modern version of pith and substance, whatever that means?"
p5,00:51:27.490,00:51:43.090,spk_1,"Indeed, My Lord, 29(3) tells us that, The question whether a provision of an act of the Scottish Parliament relates to a reserve matter is to be determined, is to be determined, subject to Subsection 4 by reference to the purpose of the provisions. And so one is enjoined"
p5,00:51:43.100,00:51:44.420,spk_0,to
p5,00:51:44.460,00:51:55.670,spk_1,"identify as a critical step in the analysis, the purpose of the provision, and then one has to ask, Is the purpose, is this purpose, does it relate to a reserve matter?"
p5,00:51:55.670,00:52:07.440,spk_0,"Yes, the trouble is that, yes, that's what you do. But it doesn't tell you what relates to, it doesn't actually, I mean does it help you with the interpretation of what's meant by, relates to?"
p5,00:52:08.790,00:52:48.870,spk_1,"Well, I think one can certainly say this, that the, it's not sufficient, not sufficient, that the provision has effects on reserved matters, not sufficient that the law on reserved matters may be amended, possibly substantially, if the purposes are a devolved matter or a non-reserved matter, going to come back to that in just a moment, the purpose is a non-reserved matter, then, well, the purpose does not relate to a reserve matter --"
p5,00:52:48.880,00:52:51.600,spk_0,"It doesn't relates to a -- it relates to a non-reserved matter, it doesn't relate to a reserved matter?"
p5,00:52:51.810,00:53:25.250,spk_1,"Yes, there is perhaps an important point there, because the structure of Scotland Act provides a single list of reserved matters. It doesn't give us a list of devolved matters, but it must, which it is very important when applying these sections not to be diverted by reason of the inevitable focus, because of that structure, on the relationship between the provision and particular reserved matters."
p5,00:53:25.250,00:53:33.160,spk_4,"I think that was a deliberate choice. I think I'm right in saying the original Act, is it the 1978 Act, did it a different way around? It put it the other way round."
p5,00:53:33.680,00:53:34.210,spk_1,And it's
p5,00:53:34.210,00:53:44.460,spk_4,"rather difficult to do. It tried to isolate what had been devolved, and this is intended, I think, to be a more widely embracing devolution system."
p5,00:53:44.750,00:54:49.150,spk_1,"But I think the point I'm trying to make, My Lord, is that inevitably, in an individual case such as this, one is focusing on the relationship between the provision in question, Section 45, and a particular reserved matter, and it's easy, perhaps, to be drawn by that focus of the debate into an over concentration on that that effect, the particular effect on the particular reserved matter, and I must mention it is important, in order to preserve the intention of Parliament, as set out in the Scotland Act, to always bring oneself back to the question, What is the purpose of this provision? And taking this provision as an example, it has a purpose which is entirely general. It's not about road traffic offences. It's about offences across the board, whether reserved, or non-reserved, and and it's important, in my submission, not to allow the structure of the legislation and the inevitable focus of the forensic discussion in a particular case to --"
p5,00:54:49.160,00:54:50.030,spk_3,I mean Section 29
p5,00:54:50.030,00:54:50.960,spk_1,wasn't put

p5,00:54:57.040,00:55:21.930,spk_4,"So once you identify the purpose, then you can say, Well, that is what it relates to, Subsection 3 tells you that, and if you find that you've identified a purpose which is, as Lord Brown has just said, which is dealing with the Scottish criminal justice system, putting it very broadly, then that isn't a reserved matter, and you pass the test for little (b)?"
p5,00:55:22.130,00:56:14.970,spk_1,"Indeed. Indeed, My Lord, perhaps there's one other point I should just make in relation to little (b), because, of course, there are two questions one will have to ask in a particular case. One is, the first, and Mr Shed correctly said, There is no issue about it in this case. But I think it's right that I mention it so that My Lords are conscious of the issue. One has to identify what the reserve matter is, and there may be cases where articulating the boundaries of the reserve matter may raise quite difficult questions, they don't arise in this case because in the particular particularity of the reserved matter that we're dealing with here, which is the subject matter of"

And indeed, that's part of the long title. And that being the case, I don't seek to suggest that this Section 45 doesn't modify the law on reserved matters, I wouldn't, that's not any submit part of my submission, but it's important that I just mention to My Lords that, in other cases, difficult questions might arise in terms of identifying what the reserve matter is. Having got past that, one asks, Does the measure relate to reserve matters? And we are told by the statute that we do that by reference to the purpose."
p5,00:57:05.070,00:57:35.100,spk_0,"Supposing Mr Walter Scotch Barn decided that the prisons were too full and therefore it was going to have all the penalties available across the board for all offences , reserved and non-reserved.

p5,00:57:36.430,00:57:55.310,spk_1,"I think the way I would answer that, and I would, I'm going to deliberately be very cautious in suggesting definitive answers in relation to matters which are not --"

p5,00:59:42.770,01:00:37.230,spk_4,"But is the answer to Lord Rodgers question to be found by looking at Schedule 4, Paragraph 2, Subparagraph 3? Because we've got here something that could be said to be a rule of Scots criminal law in the sense that it is dealing with criminal offences which are being prosecuted in Scotland, and the way that that subsection, subparagraph, is worded indicates that there could be a rule of Scots criminal law which is special to a reserved matter. Yes. And if one was trying to, had a provision which simply, head on, met this point of the penalty in the Road Traffic Offenders Act and said, Divided in half or reduce it by one half, that would be, arguably at least, something which is special to a reserved matter."

Now, of course, if the UK didn't, in relation to particular matters, did not, was not satisfied with such a provision. There are mechanisms available to it, to deal with the question.

Can I, I hope if I've leapt 29(2)(b), unless there's any other matter that any of My Lord's wish to raise on that, just make my short submission on 29(4). And it's just slightly out of order from Mr Shed that I, my primary submission is that we're not in 29(4) simply because this is a provision which modifies Scots criminal law generally and not as it applies to reserved matters.

p5,01:20:03.700,01:20:26.810,spk_1,"An act of the Scottish Parliament is now law so far as any provision of the act is outside the legislative competence of parliament. Yes? And, in my submission, that implies that where legislation is defective by reason of being overbroad, that legislation should be read as applicable only to those cases which may lawfully be covered by it."
p5,01:20:27.860,01:20:38.360,spk_4,So you narrow it down to apply only to either way offences which are to be found in in acts of the Scottish Parliament?
p5,01:20:39.020,01:20:44.820,spk_1,"Well no My Lord because, of course there are, the distinction is not between acts of the Scottish Parliament and acts the Westminster"
p5,01:20:44.820,01:20:45.530,spk_4,"Parliament,"
p5,01:20:45.720,01:20:56.140,spk_1,"but those that are reserved and non-reserved. Yes. And there are acts of the Westminster Parliament which are, deal with reserved matters which are still on the statute of criminal procedure, Scotland Act"

p5,01:20:58.940,01:21:29.220,spk_1,"example. So the legislation, the words, So far as, permit, permit, and of course, this only arises if if the court has found that otherwise the act, or the provision, would be ultra virus, that the court may read the provision in a way, so that only applies to those matters which it may lawfully apply to. And, My Lords, and that approach --"
p5,01:21:29.680,01:21:38.700,spk_3,"I'm Sorry. Hold it. I mean, is it only the Road Traffic Offenders Act which is a reserved matter to which Section 45 applies?"
p5,01:21:39.470,01:21:52.890,spk_1,"There may be others, My Lord, that there are other reserved offences which will have been affected. I don't have a list of them, I'm afraid, but it's not restricted to the Traffic Offenders Act."
p5,01:21:52.900,01:21:54.250,spk_3,"Sorry, so"
p5,01:21:56.650,01:21:56.820,spk_4,I
p5,01:21:56.820,01:22:01.220,spk_3,"mean, aren't we looking at Section 101 at this point then, I mean, on this hypothesis?"
p5,01:22:05.480,01:22:07.350,spk_1,"Yes, it's 101(2) but read along with Section 29."
p5,01:22:08.910,01:22:29.370,spk_3,"So you have to read 45 as if it says what it says, But excluding given either way offences which are reserved, I mean, and that's a reading. That's possible is it?"
p5,01:22:29.460,01:22:42.090,spk_1,"Well, My Lord, I found on section 29(1), it's perhaps a different point, it's perhaps not so much an interpretation point as a reading of 29(1),"
p5,01:22:42.670,01:22:42.870,spk_4,That
p5,01:22:42.870,01:22:52.330,spk_1,"an act of the Scottish Parliament is not law so far as any provisions of the act is outside the legislation. And it's the word, so far as, any provision of the act is outside the legislative competence of Parliament."
p5,01:22:52.880,01:23:01.340,spk_3,"Well I follow that, but you can't ignore 101(2), can you, you can't simply bypass"
p5,01:23:01.340,01:23:02.510,spk_4,the apparent
p5,01:23:02.510,01:23:12.750,spk_3,"problem in 101(2) can you, by just simply say, Well, It wasn't competent, and therefore it's not law and therefore we can ignore it, I mean?"
p5,01:23:13.080,01:23:34.000,spk_1,"Well, this approach is one which commended itself to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland, considering the Government of Ireland Act, in a case, the Ulster Transport Authority, which is in volume 3 at tab 44."
p5,01:23:34.310,01:23:38.190,spk_3,Did it have a provision equivalent to 101(2)?
p5,01:23:38.200,01:23:46.990,spk_1,"I don't know that it did, My Lord, but it had a wording similar to 29(1), and in particular, the phrase, So far as --"
p5,01:23:47.630,01:23:48.410,spk_2,"Sorry, what is it?"
p5,01:23:48.420,01:23:50.740,spk_3,Sorry. Bundle 3 what? 44.
p5,01:23:54.580,01:23:55.740,spk_1,But you
p5,01:23:55.740,01:23:58.910,spk_4,"have to construe the provision you're looking at, don't you? Yes."
p5,01:23:59.440,01:24:22.650,spk_1,"Well, everyone agree, I think My Lord, or as I understand My Lord that the provision, the ordinary, the obvious construction, reconstruction, of the provision applies across the board. And I simply offer this as a mechanism whereby one doesn't throw out the good with the bad if there is any bad, I don't accept that it is bad but,"
p5,01:24:23.370,01:24:24.590,spk_3,if there were any

p5,01:24:34.590,01:24:54.760,spk_4,"All was passing through my mind, and maybe I'm making the same point as Lord Brown, one would say, Yes, You can read the provision as applying, as within competence, because read with the assistance of section 101"
p5,01:24:54.770,01:24:55.790,spk_3,
p5,01:24:56.430,01:25:17.570,spk_4,"(2), you can read it as applying only to devolved matters. It's rather an extreme way of doing it, but it would be that it doesn't extend to statutes which are reserved, of which there may be quite a number of when you start looking down Schedule 5 at all the list of things like drugs and so on."
p5,01:25:18.690,01:25:36.450,spk_1,"Well Indeed. Well, that would be one way of approaching it, and it would be supported by the words, So far as, in Section 29 which do allow for what's being described as horizontal severance as well as --"
p5,01:25:36.460,01:26:02.190,spk_0,"But your primary submission is, as I understand it, is that Section 29(1) is dealing with severance, say you discard the bad and left with the good, Section 101 is concerned with construction. Indeed, My Lord. And it may be a very special rule of construction, like Section 3 of the Human Rights Act, but there comes a point at which you say it's not possible to deal with it as a matter of construction?"
p5,01:26:02.880,01:26:05.830,spk_1,"Yes, but I say that 29(1) allows"

This, I think, would give effect to the words, so far as it, contravenes without impinges on the menial weight to be attached to the word void, and --"
p5,01:27:15.170,01:27:36.680,spk_4,"Yes, I can just see if I've got this in my mind, that if you can engage in the exercise of severance, then you don't need to look at particular words, you simply sever but there may be you're left with a word which has to be interpreted, which you can't sever out but have to interpret, and that's where Section 101 would come in, is that the way it works?"
p5,01:27:38.280,01:27:41.720,spk_1,"Well, there maybe two ways of getting to --"
p5,01:27:41.730,01:27:44.710,spk_0,"Do you not interpret it first and then, if necessary --"
p5,01:27:45.700,01:27:45.830,spk_4,"If necessary, sever?"
p5,01:27:45.830,01:27:46.670,spk_1,"Sever, yes."
p5,01:27:47.860,01:27:52.340,spk_0,It's like under the Human Rights Act you go to Section 3 first and then you go to Section 4.
p5,01:27:52.620,01:28:44.450,spk_1,"That must be right. That must be right. So you engage in the 101(2) and then one could read it in the way that My Lord Hope has suggested. But if one can't, if by the generality of the language, one feels one simply can't read in the qualification, the answer is in 29(1), enacted in light of that, the authority from Northern Ireland. My final for that point, My Lords, I'm afraid, is a Section 102 point about suspension and retrospectivity,"
p5,01:28:44.450,01:28:45.150,spk_4,
p5,01:28:45.160,01:29:33.330,spk_1,"And I made this point because of, My Lords will recall that one is dealing here with an enactment which has been enforced now for a period of time. Sentences will have been passed in reliance on that enactment, we are not dealing with any challenge to the touches on the substance of a conviction, or on the level of any sentence, or on the maximum sentence that would have been available, and in any case, where that a sentence has been imposed, which has in fact been excessive, that will have been capable of being appealed and dealt with in the ordinary"
p5,01:29:33.330,01:29:33.930,spk_4,way.
p5,01:29:34.710,01:30:03.370,spk_1,"And, My Lords in those circumstances, in my submission there is, there would be merit in My Lords making an order, if My Lords get to this point under Section 102, confining the retrospective application of this, of such a decision, so that it doesn't affect any case other than these appellants, or any case which has been finally determined."
p5,01:30:03.680,01:30:08.720,spk_4,"Well the way you put it in Paragraph 62 of your case is, limiting"
p5,01:30:09.360,01:30:09.480,spk_0,the
p5,01:30:09.480,01:30:21.010,spk_4,retrospective effect of the decision to the two current cases and any other cases prosecuted in the courts which are still pending or have been determined.
p5,01:30:21.290,01:31:04.350,spk_1,"Yes, and I think I would also allow any case in which the very short statutory time limit for appealing the sentence under the ordinary rules for sentence appeals has not expired, and I offer that because I recognise that in issues of, questions of this sort there will be a balance to be struck between upholding the law and not opening up, not, as a result, opening up already decided cases."
p5,01:31:05.500,01:31:09.340,spk_0,Is that -- so you you say it should be limited to
p5,01:31:10.090,01:31:12.190,spk_1,"whom, this"
p5,01:31:12.190,01:31:13.690,spk_0,"pair, obviously, but who else?"
p5,01:31:15.190,01:31:53.410,spk_1,"If, My Lords get to this, an order limiting the retrospective effect to the two current cases, to any other cases which are still pending before the summary courts, or the Appeal Court, and to any case in which the very short statutory time limit for appealing has not expired. And that's the statutory time limit, I think, in Section 186 of the Criminal Procedure Scotland Act."
p5,01:31:53.640,01:32:03.290,spk_3,"Sorry I'm not sure I'm really quite following, I mean how does it actually work on your two clients? Does it simply eliminate their sentences altogether, or does it cut them to six months?"
p5,01:32:03.310,01:32:27.430,spk_1,"Well, on disposal, my submission would be that if, if the appellants were successful, that this court should remit the matter to the High Court with instructions to pass the bill and remit to the sheriff for sentencing because there may be issues, Mr. Brown mentioned issues around the plea of guilty, there may be issues that make it slightly more complicated than My Lords simply cutting the sentence down."
p5,01:32:27.440,01:32:35.740,spk_3,"So you mean, if it had originally been a maximum six months on summary disposal, well then he maybe wouldn't have got the full six months?"
p5,01:32:36.450,01:32:39.440,spk_1,Well I --
p5,01:32:40.730,01:32:42.190,spk_0,lest
p5,01:32:42.190,01:32:46.890,spk_1,"there be any particular factual [inaudible], I'm quite content the matter goes back to the --"
p5,01:32:46.890,01:32:53.420,spk_3,"Well it wouldn't be open to the prosecutor to say, Well we think we'll have you on indictment after all, would it, or would it? No, no. Why not?"
p5,01:32:53.430,01:32:58.520,spk_1,The full the.
p5,01:33:00.450,01:33:14.950,spk_3,"And in the outstanding cases, then the question, you say, cases still pending, well then the sheriff is going to be told, Well, Presumably, there's already been an election for summary disposal by then?"
p5,01:33:14.960,01:33:15.530,spk_1,"Yes, well there would have been by then."
p5,01:33:15.960,01:33:20.660,spk_3,"And so the sheriff's simply told, Well, You're back to your old maximum, six months, is that it?"
p5,01:33:21.960,01:33:22.620,spk_0,I thought you said?
p5,01:33:24.160,01:33:24.860,spk_1,I'm sorry?
p5,01:33:24.870,01:33:26.860,spk_0,I thought you were giving them the benefit of it?
p5,01:33:27.140,01:33:28.560,spk_1,"Yes, I, reckon --"
p5,01:33:28.680,01:33:30.480,spk_0,Why are you giving them the benefit of it?
p5,01:33:31.270,01:34:20.770,spk_1,"Well, I can see that the logic, the logic of the fact that there were not actually changing any maximum sentence would be that one simply, perhaps rather than limiting the retrospective effect, one might simply suspend the effect of the order to allow the matter to be put right if, and I think it would have to be the Westminster, the United Kingdom, were prepared to do so. I mean, that would be the alternative way to approach it, simply to suspend the effect of any order, in order to allow the United Kingdom, if so advised, to put in place a mechanism whereby the matter could be corrected."
p5,01:34:20.910,01:34:28.670,spk_4,"I would have thought that really was the primary purpose of section 102(2), really, to enable that kind of thing to be done?"
p5,01:34:28.680,01:35:04.460,spk_1,"Yes, and I suppose if in this case there would be some substantive merit in it because one is dealing with a, something which doesn't touch on the merits of the case, which doesn't touch on the maximum sentence available and which, and where, if there has been an excessive sentence, it could have been appealed. Sorry, My Lords, I perhaps have"
p5,01:35:04.470,01:35:05.890,spk_6,not
p5,01:35:06.130,01:35:15.450,spk_1,"been as well, formulated this very well. Perhaps my primary position should be a suspension to allow that to be done?"
p5,01:35:15.880,01:35:23.610,spk_4,"Well, that fits with Section 102(2)(b), the concluding words, which is, To suspend, To allow the defect to be corrected."
p5,01:35:23.690,01:35:35.490,spk_1,"Yes, I think what I would have to recognise in the case that were hypothesising is that any correction would have to involve the United Kingdom, now that might be done by the United Kingdom passing an order which --"
p5,01:35:35.850,01:35:43.040,spk_0,"Is that at Section 107, is that where? --"
p5,01:35:45.980,01:35:47.860,spk_4,"Yes, yes, yes. I think I'm"
p5,01:35:49.040,01:35:49.690,spk_1,"right in saying. I'm just asking, it's curiously imprecise"
p5,01:35:51.660,01:35:59.000,spk_0,"as to who is doing it. I think it would have to follow, it would have to be the United Kingdom."
p5,01:35:59.010,01:36:19.420,spk_1,"I think that's right, My Lord. And since since the essence of the problem is plreserved matters, so I think perhaps my primary position should be a suspension of the order to allow that at least to be a considered, which failing a limitation on the retrospectivity of the provision."
p5,01:36:19.710,01:36:21.360,spk_3,Well how does it effect these two clients?
p5,01:36:21.450,01:36:34.940,spk_1,"Well, I'm reluctant to -- if it were a suspension, I suppose they would lose the benefit of their appeal, and --"
p5,01:36:36.080,01:36:37.280,spk_0,I think that would be -- Well it might be contrary to the Human Rights Act for the Westminster Parliament to grant such a [inaudible].
p5,01:36:37.800,01:37:10.860,spk_1,"That if that were the case, well, there are interesting questions about retrospectivity which arise. I think this court might have to do something in that regard. Now I recognise that it's hard to deprive appellants who have been successful where the issue is the lawfulness of what's been done off the fruits of their of, of the fruits, so."
p5,01:37:12.750,01:37:27.910,spk_0,"But other people who haven't taken the point don't get the benefit. Shouldn't get the benefit. If other people have lodged a bill, as sometimes people do, lodge challenges formally to piggyback onto the thing, and then they may or may not get the benefit, but other people who haven't, don't?"
p5,01:37:28.120,01:38:16.160,spk_1,"Well they shouldn't, in my submission, and that's really what I'm inviting the court to do by way of laws under Section 102. Yes. And my submission on disposal is that , if My Lords are with the appellant's, it should go back to the sheriff, if My Lords are with me, I would also invite My Lords to remit, to refuse the appeal, but to remit the matter back to the High Court. And I do that because if the appeal is refused, issues of seeking a warrant to arrest these two appellants will have to be dealt with, and I don't wish to trouble My Lords with any question relating to that.

p5,01:38:42.940,01:40:23.920,spk_2,"The time I estimated for this submission has, of course, been dramatically shortened as a result of the approach adopted by the Advocate Depute, I would adopt, substantially, the interpretation proffered by the advocate depute in relation to the interpretation and application of Section 29 in Schedule 4 and fully support the conclusion that the respondent offers in her case. There's perhaps little to add on that area, one of the points that had caused me to consider that this might be a rather more lengthy submission than it was was the way in which the respondent had set out, in her case, a substantial assessment of the constitutional position as it's described, and this in the case between Paragraphs 20 and 40 substantially, from the Lord Advocate. And My Lords, I suspect I am not in a quandary, but the way I would look at it is this, My Lords have not been addressed on these issues orally, they are, however, set out substantially in the statement of case. Now, I would not wish My Lords to think that what appears in the statement of case is accepted word for word by me."

p5,01:40:55.190,01:41:02.640,spk_4,"Now just a moment, we've got two cases. We've got Martin and Miller, are the paragraphs,"
p5,01:41:06.380,01:41:07.370,spk_2,"so they are identical -- they are actually --the numbers are slightly different. So we take Martin do we, yes?"
p5,01:41:07.370,01:41:31.740,spk_4,"And we begin at Paragraph 20 because 19 is not contentious I think that's just simply telling us what we need to look at, and I think you said onto Paragraph 40 but that doesn't, that seems to go rather further than would be right?"

p5,01:41:38.690,01:41:53.770,spk_4,"29 is dealing with Section 29(2)(b), and that's really into the meat of the arguments so can we just be quite sure what it is that you want us to excise from your general agreement?"
p5,01:41:55.010,01:42:33.270,spk_2,"Well, specifically My Lords, in Paragraph 20 there is a discussion which appears to suggest, and I'm speculating to a degree, but what it does suggest at E to F is that the Scotland Act is to be regarded as a constitution. Now I can develop that a little more if My Lords would wish, but given that there hasn't been argument --"
p5,01:42:33.270,01:42:44.090,spk_4,"I doubt that's actually going to help us very much because, I think, it's common ground between the appellants and the respondents that what we're really looking at is the wording of the statute and applying it."

And I would simply draw My Lords attention to the fact that the memorandum of understanding itself sets out that it is a non-binding agreement, therefore it would seem unlikely to in some way extend or have a direct impact as a matter of law on the Scotland Act. And perhaps outside that general area, the other point I would never take issue with is at Paragraph 57, and, in relation to the discussion about the use of the word necessary in Paragraph 3 of Schedule 4, and again, this perhaps goes a little further than I might necessarily accept, because it goes on to talk about a degree of latitude being accorded to the Scottish Parliament and the advocate depute in dealing with this particular area proffered the notion of discretionary judgement of the Scottish Parliament. Well, I would argue that necessary does not actually have a meaning that suggests a wide range of latitude. But, as I say, that this has not turned out to be a discussion, it's simply for the greater caution. In relation to disposal I would broadly agree with the approach suggested by the advocate depute, but to the extent that this should be sent to Westminster for the curing of defects, I would share immediately, with respect, My Lord Walker's observation that this may well have significant European Convention consequences, and would require to be looked at very closely and it should not be taken at in any way I am assenting to the notion that in some way Westminster would simply set about curing what is a described defect."

And, of course, My Lords, should for any reason, the sheriff impose a sentence which might arguably be regarded as excessive, then they would preserve any conventional right of appeal the decision. So, if I may say so long as I can see force in that proposal, if Your Lordships were otherwise with the appellant. Yes. My Lords, therefore, I would, if I could just raise one or two matters which seemed to have emerged from the discussion.

My Lords, however the position, My Lords, in answer to the questions, I think both the Lord Brown and My Lord Rodger raised with the learned advocate deput about the hypothetical situation of the Scottish Parliament seeking to reduce the penalties are nevertheless, in my respectful submission, apt questions because My Lords are starting from the position that the Scottish Parliament cannot legislate in respect of reserved matters, and in my respectful submission, in the stark examples that Your Lordships put to learned advocate Depute, then the position would be that the Scottish Parliament would be acting beyond its competence because Your Lordships are concerned with the matter, in this context of a penalty under the Road Traffic Offenders Act, but it's comprehended within the scheme of the legislation."
p5,01:59:38.500,01:59:42.930,spk_4,"And by a stark example you mean reducing everything down to one weeks' penalty, is that the kind of thing?"
p5,01:59:42.940,02:01:05.120,spk_5,"Absolutely My Lord, because the situation is that Parliament, in enacting the Scotland Act, has very specifically prescribed reserved matters which are to be, are not to be legislated upon as a generality by the Scottish Parliament. Now, My Lords, that happens to extend in my submission to the Road Traffic Offenders Act and the penalty provision in the act. It goes as wide as that, in my respectful submission, so that that's the starting point. And, therefore, in my respectful submission, the questions which Your Lordships posed are useful ways to analyse the matter, and the answer to them would be, in my respectful submission, that they were, such legislation would be beyond the competence of the Scottish Parliament. Yes. Now, something My Lords, was also made of the question of the of the unfortunate practicalities of the potential for parallel legislation. Now Of course, My Lord's, in my respectful submission, that may, that may be to miss an important point, which is, Westminster Parliament has decided on what the relevant penalty is in respect of the Road Traffic Offenders Act. And it's therefore for Westminster to decide, in my respectful submission, whether the penalty be increased or"

In sentences which are four years or more, the question becomes a matter, in due course, in some instances, for the parole board for Scotland. And these are, as I would understand them My Lord."

And, in my respectful submission, to Your Lordships, that is a useful way to look at the question raised with the learned advocate deputy as to whether there would be a need for a parallel legislative provision.

And I simply touch on this, given that there has been some reference to the potential for sentence drift, as a matter, I think, of common knowledge, certainly, north of the border. The prison population, despite the efforts that were referred to yesterday by the learned advocate deputy has increased notwithstanding diversion from prosecution. So, it may be that there is an implicit sentence drift in the raising of the prison population, which is perhaps bolstered by the fact that, as a matter of administration of sentencing, the Scottish prison service is releasing earlier than provided for in the Prisoners and Criminal Proceeding Scotland Act, the Westminster legislation my learned friend was referring to, which allows release at half of service of a sentence under 4, but is in fact is now allowing release after half of a half, subject to certain risk contingents. But that is a matter of simply background. I say that My Lords because, in my respectful submission, as accepted by the learned advocate depute, the crucial word, Issue, before Your Lordships is the words of the statute.
