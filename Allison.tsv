1	p1,00:19:23.450,00:20:03.410,spk_4,	True	Counsel: What I would say is this and this in is my submission, the important point, the evidence that Stronach gave via his statement evidence which came from, as it were, the dead Stronach was of a different character than all the other pieces of circumstantial evidence. It was not just a piece of circumstantial evidence like any other. By that, I mean, it was the only piece of circumstantial evidence that directly linked the accused Allison to a drug transaction.

1	p3,01:56:44.930,01:57:41.410,spk_2,	True	The Court: Well, is it? They said against you? I'm looking at paragraph 54 of the Lord Advocates case that we're looking at a maximum sentence of imprisonment which really is inherent. I think it's to be found in the Criminal Procedure Scotland Act, I may be wrong. The maximum sentence available on summary procedure prior to the amendment I'm talking about was a rule that was not special to the Road traffic act at all. It was one that applied generally to all statutory offences and examples are given in the Lord Advocate's case of statutes such as the Civic Government, Scotland Act, the protection of Wild Animals, Scotland Act, Sexual Offences, Act, and so on and so forth which are not reserved and therefore we're dealing with a statutory maximum which applies across the board to both reserved and not reserved statutory offences.

1	p2,00:33:56.430,00:35:44.540,spk_2,	True	Counsel: He again, at paragraph 85, repeats that by saying, Taking all the relevant factors together, I have reached the conclusion that in this case, the failures of The Lord Advocate's Representative to disclose information to the defence and the advocate deputy's reliance on the dock identifications of Gilchrist and Simpson were incompatible with the appellant's core Article 6 Convention Rights, taking together, they resulted in an unfair trial. So as I understand that a proper analysis of what His Lordship said, he makes it plain that it was the cumulative effect of all the factors taken together that led to the conclusion that the trial was not fair. And what I would invite this court to do is to come to the view, for purposes of clarity, for those who seek to seize upon that particular passage to which I have referred, is to come to the conclusion that His Lordship was not stipulating that the Hogg v Clark test should be used in order to determine whether there had been a miscarriage of justice or unfair trial. Rather what he was attempting to do, correctly in my respectful submission, was considering whether the non-disclosure of the outstanding charges was so unlikely to have been a practical effect that it could be left out of account all together, as opposed to whether it forms part of a cumulative evaluation. So, My Lords, in terms of My Lord and the chair's question about how this matter has come to pass, it has come to pass as a result of that particular remark by His Lordship in the paragraph to which I have referred being taken entirely out of context and applied to grounds of appeal, in particular additional evidence appeals, before the Criminal Appeal Court in Scotland.
1	p1,01:08:31.120,01:12:01.400,spk_6,	True	Counsel: On page 23 the tape explains the particular status that he has, the bottom of page 23, line 23 should be, John Stronach said is credible and reliable, and in doing so, you will have to exercise great care. You will have to approach what he said with caution, and this is for a number of reasons. First of all, it's not evidence not given under oath and explains that, and he also explains that not had the opportunity to see him being cross examined at line, 16 and 17 not tested in Line 19, His lordship said, It seems pretty clear, accepted, really at all hands by both the crown and by the defence that in the course of what he told the police, he told many lies both about what happened on the 24th of November and about other matters. Much of what he said was contradicted by the contents of surveillance logs, that should be, and the other evidence, such as the searches of his house referred to in the drug inquiry or whatever. There is, however, a passage in which in which the crown do seek to rely. And that is what he said about a man called Stevie from Abran Hill, whom he described and said that he had asked him to take the car down to Kilmarnock. And the crown suggests first that you could infer that that was a reference to the first accused and that if you took the part that you if you accepted Mr Stronach's account, the man, Stephen made an arrangement and told him to take the car rejected his qualifications that it was for the purpose of selling the car and took along with other evidence and took that along with other evidence in the case. Then it pointed to the first accused being concerned in the supply of drugs the crown suggests to you. You could find comfort for accepting that particular part of his evidence in the interview, from the evidence of Detectives Sergeant Duncan Smith to the effect that he saw the usual car in the driveway of the house about lunchtime on the day. And also, I think the Advocate Depute referred to in evidence that on the 27th of November, the first accused took the passport of John Stronach to Airdrie Sheriff Court for all the the purpose of Mr Stronach being released on bail on the charge that related to the journey to Ayeshire and that has a compelling piece of evidence as well in my submission, and indeed that there was reference to the other journey linking the appellant. And it's described of as being a spectacular coincidence by the Advocate Depute if he were not connected. And that, of course, was precisely a matter for the jury to assess. But he was not presented by the crown it's ultimately a matter for the jury was not presented as an absolutely honest and truthful man, and indeed, while is not evidence, of course of what the Advocate Depute said in his speech. The acceptance of him being a liar would my submission have carried significant weight in the deliberation of the jury and the invitation to only rely on those parts of his evidence which were supported by other evidence, was another safeguard. So it was pretty clear in my submission. This is a witness who could not be trusted, but on key parts, the Crown invited the jury to accept evidence which was capable of being looked at elsewhere in my submission that there was plainly sufficient evidence without the 259 statement and the direct link because --

2	p1,00:11:02.870,00:11:32.960,spk_4,	True	Counsel: Without being anecdotal, there is a case due to come back to the appeal court in Scotland and precisely that point. Where a key witness it has now been discovered had an outstanding charge, and the witness against him in the outstanding charge is the person who gave evidence against in the trial. Now that case is in the pipeline to come back as a reference from the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission. So it gives a perfect example, if I may say so of that happening.
2	p2,00:31:46.780,00:33:55.230,spk_2,	True	Counsel: And what he says is this, But the ultimate question is whether the trial as a whole was fair, And that question can only be decided by the same court, considering all its relevant strengths and weaknesses, including any breaches of specific safeguards and Article 6 together, It follows that although the issues relating to identification and non-disclosure were argued in sequence of the hearing before the board, in deciding whether the appellant can be said to have a fair trial, the board must consider all the relevant elements together. So, My Lords, in my respectful submission, with the Lord Rodger dealing with the issue of dock identification Paragraphs 47 to 63, non-disclosure of outstanding charges, Paragraphs 64 to 75, and the failure to disclose a remark made by a witness at Paragraph 76, he then correctly, in my respectful submission, at Paragraph 77, again sums up the position, saying this, It is now necessary to consider whether taken as a whole, the appellant's trial was fair in terms of Article 6(1), and that's with reference to Paragraph 43. So, in other words, in my respectful submission, he's claiming to speak for himself, but in the paragraphs to which I have referred, balancing the various factors, he had regard to all of these which had a bearing on the overall fairness of the trial and insofar as he refers to Hogg v Clark, in the context of determining the significance of one, of the supposedly unfair features, the non-disclosure of certain information in my respectful submission, no conclusion at all that can be drawn at this point in the opinion, that the proceedings were unfair solely on account of that one factor, and it has to be put into the context of what he said before and what he said later. And it was only when taking all of the matters together -- and he again at Paragraph 85 repeats that, by saying, Taking all the relevant factors together I've reached the conclusion that in this case the failures of the Lord Advocate's representatives to disclose information to the defence and the Advocate Depute's reliance on the dock identification of Gilchrist and Simpson were incompatible with the Appellant's core Article 6 Convention rights, taken together they resulted in an unfair trial.
2	p1,00:13:43.290,00:14:14.840,spk_4,	True	Counsel: But what I think. I don't want to speak for the Advocate Depute and what the crown, I think are saying in this case that is all curable at this stage in the sense that when you look at it, you would say, well, it's not material in the same way as rightly or wrongly, the appeal court in Scotland cure, if i may use that word, the lack of disclosure of the previous convictions. The crown are inviting you to do the same with the outstanding cases and say, in lay terms, it didn't matter all that much.
2	p2,00:33:56.430,00:35:44.540,spk_2,	True	Counsel: And he again at paragraph 85 repeats that by saying, Taking all the relevant factors together, I have reached the conclusion that in this case, the failures of The Lord Advocate's Representative to disclose information to the defence and the advocate deputy's reliance on the dock identifications of Gilchrist and Simpson were incompatible with the appellant's core Article 6 Convention Rights, taking together, they resulted in an unfair trial. So as I understand that a proper analysis of what His Lordship said, he makes it plain that it was the cumulative effect of all the factors taken together that led to the conclusion that the trial was not fair. And what I would invite this court to do is to come to the view, for purposes of clarity, for those who seek to seize upon that particular passage to which I have referred, is to come to the conclusion that His Lordship was not stipulating that the Hogg v Clark test should be used in order to determine whether there had been a miscarriage of justice or unfair trial.

2	p1,00:38:45.370,00:39:39.920,spk_4,	True	Counsel: I think the crown mentioned the fact that the outstanding charges of the Misuse of Drugs Act would not have been used in any event because they would have linked us into a man with a drugs business. I don't accept that. For this reason, it was never going to be in dispute. In the real world of the case, he was associated with people like that. So leading evidence that someone he associated with had a drug conviction was not that harmful because that was passed praying for. What was necessary was to say to the jury, you can't rely on this man, so I don't see how bringing out he would have had a previous conviction. A man, he would have been linked to a man who had outstanding charges for drugs matters would have been of terrible importance because the crown were proving that umpteen times.

2	p2,00:47:44.140,00:48:02.460,spk_2,	True	Counsel: There are a number of cases that come before the Appeals Court in Scotland, which are cases which involve non-disclosure. Some are presented as fresh evidence cases, and some are simply presented to the court that it was a breach of Article 6. And so they come before the court by different routes.
2	p1,01:00:31.060,01:01:29.510,spk_6,	True	Counsel: With reference to Findlay against United Kingdom held that a person charged with a serious offence was entitled to First Instance tribunal, which fully met the requirements of Article 6(1) again, there could be no question of that being capable of being rectified by the process of appeal. Reference is further made to Edwards to which I'll return to. However, Edwards, the European Court of Human Rights had to consider the question of whether or not the fact that evidence had been withheld from the defence at trial rendered the proceedings unfair. The same issue as is raised in the case in this case, the Court of Appeal in that case consider that the evidence that had been withheld in the light of all the material available and concluded that the evidence that had been withheld would have made no difference to the jury's verdict. The European Court of Human Rights held at the proceedings were not unfair, although there had been a defect in the trial at first instance that had been cured by fair and proper consideration of the evidence in the Court of Appeal.

2	p1,00:52:24.220,00:53:35.270,spk_6,	True	Counsel: In my submission the right to disclosure of all relevant material has a broad scope and incudes material which may only have a marginal bearing on the ultimate issues at the trial. Accordingly, a failure by the Crown to disclose disclosable material, may meet the threshold as [inaudible] to have tab 10 in the Allison bound volume of authorities, but could not possibly affect the reliability of the result reached in the trial or the overall fairness of the trial process. The defence may not be impaired as a result of the obligation to disclose not being complied with. It is obvious I submit that a finding that an accused right to disclosure has been violated does not end the analysis. A failure by the crown to disclose material may be incompatible with Article 6(1), but it by no means necessarily follows in my submission that the accused has not had a fair trial in terms of Article 6, or that there has been some other miscarriage of justice and I take up the point made by Lord Roger in McDonald found at tab 10, paragraph 77.
2	p4,00:02:00.140,00:02:50.630,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The second issue, My Lord, relates to the discussion of disqualified driving before the 2007 Act came into effect and the distinction between indictment proceedings, and summary proceedings. In my [inaudible], the principal use of the [inaudible] proceedings was simply a progression from repeated summary offending and marked a way for the court to make clear that this would be taken more seriously, and that was the norm as opposed to [inaudible] Lord Roger Earlsferry, association other matters, it should also be borne in mind, of course, that in terms of the proceedings Section 103 prosecutions would always of necessity stand alone, because of the nature of the allegations. Yes.
2	p3,00:04:51.340,00:05:43.630,spk_3,	True	Counsel: As Your Lordships will be aware, the issue in the appeal is whether Section 45 of the Criminal Proceedings etc. Reform Scotland Act 2007, in so far as it increases or purports to increase the maximum sentence on summary conviction for a contravention of Section 103(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act in 1988, as amended, is within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. And My Lords, I think we'll see the issue set out in the statement of facts and issues which My Lords will find, I hope in the bound volume at tab 2. Yes. Lords, if I could say just a very little about the immediate background to Mr Martin's case before inviting Your Lordships' attention to the terms of the Scotland Act. My Lords, before the passing of the 2007 Act, the relevant penalty was provided for by Parliament by Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Road Traffic Offenders Act.

2	p2,01:00:48.240,01:02:16.710,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Very briefly, My Lords, in case there's any doubt about my position on this matter, the learned advocate depute said that I made a concession that the court identified and then applied the correct test. What I did say, and I've checked the notes with my colleague, is that I conceded they certainly identified the test, but I said they misapplied it. So in effect is, I suppose, the metaphor is having the correct horse but putting the wrong rider on its back, and as a result of that, it effectively neutralised the whole process. The second point, My Lords, very briefly, is I do not submit or accept that examining fresh evidence appeals in terms of The Criminal Procedure Act Scotland 1995 offers a great deal of assistance because, in relation to non-disclosure, for example, I think My Lord Brown I identified the point, perhaps, is also, and My Lord in the chair identified the point, I think it was, that a fresh evidence case is looking at something that was never before the court, whereas in a case such as this, where it's withheld evidence, it could in fact be more of the same, but the sort of material that could tip the balance where, for example, one witness says another witness is incorrect. But if there's a battery of witnesses who are not disclosed, say that witness was incorrect, that's not fresh evidence as such. It's quite a different, it's a different animal. So those are the only points I wish to raise with My Lord, My Lords.

2	p1,01:54:17.940,01:56:37.630,spk_5,	True	Counsel: Though it is not apparent that what was the appropriate test was a matter of argument before the judicial Committee and Lord Roger's test is not repeated in Sinclair, which is concerned with underscored statements. In the latter case, Lord Roger was in a position to conclude that the appellant's Solicitor Advocate quote would have been in a position to cross examine Mr Ritchie effectively, and the appellant's trial as a whole would have been fair, paragraph 50. Lord Roger's test has been used or abused in argument in this jurisdiction to suggest that the threshold of reversing the verdict of a jury in a non disclosure and analogous cases is low. That this may be a [inaudible] of Lord Roger's words in the context of determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice or we think an unfair trial, a robust test is required. The test of a real risk of prejudice to the defence was rightly, in our view, adopted in Kelly v Her Majesty Advocate, Paragraph 33. My Lords I turn to that part in a moment. But the second reason I say that the court adopted the wrong test can be shown that adopted the wrong test is the way in which it treated the previously withheld evidence in this case, in the context of the rest of the evidence. When the appeal court came to look at what was not disclosed at the trial, they appear to have taken a very strict approach, suggesting that the barrier has been raised. My Lords, it was never argued, referring to the first part of this point. It was never argued in the Appeal Court that there was a low threshold. What was argued was that, quite rightly, my submission and it's accepted by the crown was the threshold. The test is materiality. It could never be suggested that a piece of immaterial information such as who took photographs, could affect the outcome of anything. It maybe, if the person who took the photographs heard a comment by a complainer, for example, but generally speaking, it can't, its materiality. Except it was also accepted at the trial that the court must make some assessment of the withheld evidence in the context of the evidence that was learned at trial. 
2	p1,00:01:44.360,00:02:23.370,spk_2,	True	The Court: Well, there are two basic points I would have thought the first was whether there was a failure to disclose material which should have been disclosed. And that's accepted that the outstanding charges should have been disclosed. And I think it's accepted that the court below went too far in just dismissing the outstanding charges is something which could not possibly have any importance. And then there's a question whether the devolution issue and that's accepted, Mr. Prentice, I think, isn't it? So there we are and the question really is disposal, isn't it? And that's what we do next. Counsel: I mean what I do next is turn over four pages [inaudible] [laughing].
2	p2,00:28:37.330,00:29:53.140,spk_2,	True	Counsel: And if I can just deal with that paragraph and, My Lords, will bear in mind that the case of Holland dealt not only with issues of non-disclosure but also dealt with issues of identification, particularly adult identification and also issues of previous convictions, if I remember correctly. And in Paragraph 82 it's set out that, clearly, if the appellants convictions had been revealed to the jury, this might have well been a disastrous consequence to adopt the Lord Justice Clark's description, but given what Miss Lin said in evidence and Miss Gilchrist's claim that she did not know what was meant by gear, and I am unable to say that cross-examination of the complainers about the outstanding drugs charges would inevitably have led to the Crown being permitted to cross-examine the appellant on his previous convictions, Information about the outstanding charges might therefore have played a useful part in the defence effort to undermine the credibility of the crime principal witness in charge two, At least that possibility, he says, Cannot be excluded. One cannot tell for sure what the effect of such cross-examination would have been, But applying the test suggested by Lord Justice General Clyde in Hogg v Clark, I cannot say that the council was unable to cross-examine in that way, it might not possibly have affected the jury's majority verdict on charge number three.

3	p1,00:55:33.240,00:57:12.750,spk_6,	True	Counsel: Oh, and the quotation there by Lord Collins in Farrell, in which Lord Bingham sets out there. Thus, we have a clear and simple case in which the convictions of the prosecution witnesses, witness was not, were not disclosed when they should have been as a result of inadvertence or oversight. What is the effect of such non disclosure? If a defendant is convicted in evidence of convictions in the part of the prosecution witness, then comes to light? There is no simple and straightforward answer to that question. The answer will depend on the weight of the evidence in the case. Apart from the evidence of the witness whose convictions have not been disclosed, the greater the weight of the other evidence, the less significance, other things being equal. The non disclosure is likely to have had. The answer will also dependent on the extent to which the credibility and honesty of the prosecution witness, whose convictions have not been disclosed is at the heart of the case. If, as here, the prosecution witness whose convictions have not been disclosed, is the only witness against a defendant, the defendant and his credibility and honesty are squarely an issue, and the jury are led to believe that the witness is of good character when such is not the case, then there is a strong ground for contending that the conviction is unsafe. And one can see that as an obvious example where non disclosure would have a quite significant impact upon the actual live issues at the trial.

What I did say, and I've checked the notes with my colleague, is that I conceded they certainly identified the test, but I said they misapplied it. So in effect is, I suppose, the metaphor is having the correct horse but putting the wrong rider on its back, and as a result of that, it effectively neutralised the whole process. The second point, My Lords, very briefly, is I do not submit or accept that examining fresh evidence appeals in terms of The Criminal Procedure Act Scotland 1995 offers a great deal of assistance because, in relation to non-disclosure, for example, I think My Lord Brown I identified the point, perhaps, is also, and My Lord in the chair identified the point, I think it was, that a fresh evidence case is looking at something that was never before the court, whereas in a case such as this, where it's withheld evidence, it could in fact be more of the same, but the sort of material that could tip the balance where, for example, one witness says another witness is incorrect. But if there's a battery of witnesses who are not disclosed, say that witness was incorrect, that's not fresh evidence as such. It's quite a different, it's a different animal. So those are the only points I wish to raise with My Lord, My Lords.

You will have to approach what he said with caution, and this is for a number of reasons. First of all, it's not evidence not given under oath and explains that, and he also explains that not had the opportunity to see him being cross examined at line, 16 and 17 not tested in Line 19, His lordship said, It seems pretty clear, accepted, really at all hands by both the crown and by the defence that in the course of what he told the police, he told many lies both about what happened on the 24th of November and about other matters. Much of what he said was contradicted by the contents of surveillance logs, that should be, and the other evidence, such as the searches of his house referred to in the drug inquiry or whatever. There is, however, a passage in which in which the crown do seek to rely. And that is what he said about a man called Stevie from Abran Hill, whom he described and said that he had asked him to take the car down to Kilmarnock. And the crown suggests first that you could infer that that was a reference to the first accused and that if you took the part that you if you accepted Mr Stronach's account, the man, Stephen made an arrangement and told him to take the car rejected his qualifications that it was for the purpose of selling the car and took along with other evidence and took that along with other evidence in the case. Then it pointed to the first accused being concerned in the supply of drugs the crown suggests to you. You could find comfort for accepting that particular part of his evidence in the interview, from the evidence of Detectives Sergeant Duncan Smith to the effect that he saw the usual car in the driveway of the house about lunchtime on the day. And also, I think the Advocate Depute referred to in evidence that on the 27th of November, the first accused took the passport of John Stronach to Airdrie Sheriff Court for all the the purpose of Mr Stronach being released on bail on the charge that related to the journey to Ayeshire and that has a compelling piece of evidence as well in my submission, and indeed that there was reference to the other journey linking the appellant. And it's described of as being a spectacular coincidence by the Advocate Depute if he were not connected. And that, of course, was precisely a matter for the jury to assess. But he was not presented by the crown it's ultimately a matter for the jury was not presented as an absolutely honest and truthful man, and indeed, while is not evidence, of course of what the Advocate Depute said in his speech. The acceptance of him being a liar would my submission have carried significant weight in the deliberation of the jury and the invitation to only rely on those parts of his evidence which were supported by other evidence, was another safeguard. So it was pretty clear in my submission. This is a witness who could not be trusted, but on key parts, the Crown invited the jury to accept evidence which was capable of being looked at elsewhere in my submission that there was plainly sufficient evidence without the 259 statement and the direct link because --

One cannot tell for sure what the effect of such cross-examination would have been, But applying the test suggested by Lord Justice General Clyde in Hogg v Clark, I cannot say that the council was unable to cross-examine in that way, it might not possibly have affected the jury's majority verdict on charge number three.

4	p1,00:40:33.800,00:41:28.920,spk_4,	True	Counsel: I can only come back to the point I've made about the tipping point. That's the only way I can answer that. There is a tipping point in a case and who knows how juries mind may precisely work they may, also, there is the idea of which I don't know how this would have worked to the trial, that someone may have a motive if they have outstanding charges. Juries, for all I know, maybe more worried about people with outstanding charges. They may find it less that to My Lords point about whether one would buy the used car from a man with a fraud outstanding charge that the layperson may have more worries about accepting people with outstanding charges than with convictions. All I say, it is cumulative, and when you can't cross examine the witness and the evidence is as important as this evidence was to be denied ammunition like that is material in terms of the test we have.
4	p1,00:55:33.240,00:57:12.750,spk_6,	True	Counsel: Oh, and the quotation there by Lord Collins in Farrell, in which Lord Bingham sets out there. Thus, we have a clear and simple case in which the convictions of the prosecution witnesses, witness was not, were not disclosed when they should have been as a result of inadvertence or oversight. What is the effect of such non disclosure? If a defendant is convicted in evidence of convictions in the part of the prosecution witness, then comes to light? There is no simple and straightforward answer to that question. The answer will depend on the weight of the evidence in the case. Apart from the evidence of the witness whose convictions have not been disclosed, the greater the weight of the other evidence, the less significance, other things being equal. The non disclosure is likely to have had. The answer will also dependent on the extent to which the credibility and honesty of the prosecution witness, whose convictions have not been disclosed is at the heart of the case. If, as here, the prosecution witness whose convictions have not been disclosed, is the only witness against a defendant, the defendant and his credibility and honesty are squarely an issue, and the jury are led to believe that the witness is of good character when such is not the case, then there is a strong ground for contending that the conviction is unsafe. And one can see that as an obvious example where non disclosure would have a quite significant impact upon the actual live issues at the trial.

4	p2,00:52:03.880,00:54:40.530,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Certainly, I take My Lord's point, that in all of the jurisprudence in a number of different jurisdictions, that generally is the kind of approach that's taken in American jurisprudence, it's a reasonable prospect of a different result, for example. And is also consistent with the approach taken to fresh evidence in England and Wales, where the Court of Appeal considers whether the evidence given a trial might reasonably have affected the jury's decision to convict. So I take entirely Lord Brown's point in relation to that. The formulation of the various words used effectively amount to the same thing, that there has been prejudice caused to the appellant in his trial that might reasonably have affected a jury's decision to convict him. And, frankly, if the court in Scotland will keep the matter simple and consistent, it would be of use to everybody, including this particular court and, in my respectful submission, eventually alighting upon the world's, real risk of prejudice is a perfectly sensible and practical way of remedying any defect that has occurred in the original trial. My Lords I don't wish to take the matter any further unless My Lord's wish me to. But I would invite them, respectfully, in relation to what Lord Rodger has said, if issuing any judgement in this case, to make it clear that that those remarks to which we've been discussing have been taken out of context and should not be in future cases, and that may be of assistance both to counsel drafting grounds of appeal, and to the Court of Appeal. I would also invite them to come to the conclusion that the test alighted upon by the Appeal Court, namely real risk of prejudice, was entirely appropriate and was compliant with Article 6, and I would also invite them to come to the conclusion that in applying that test, they did so correctly, providing cogent reasons for their decision and that they were entitled to reach the conclusions that they did upon that material. And, My Lord's have heard what I have to say about issues relating to fresh evidence appeals, and how there can be a consistency between the various tests, all be it expressed somewhat differently in their terms, and on that basis, we to come to the conclusion the appeal has currently set out and argued today is without merit, and to refuse this appeal.

I don't accept that. For this reason, it was never going to be in dispute. In the real world of the case, he was associated with people like that. So leading evidence that someone he associated with had a drug conviction was not that harmful because that was passed praying for. What was necessary was to say to the jury, you can't rely on this man, so I don't see how bringing out he would have had a previous conviction. A man, he would have been linked to a man who had outstanding charges for drugs matters would have been of terrible importance because the crown were proving that umpteen times.

5	p1,00:52:24.220,00:53:35.270,spk_6,	True	Counsel: In my submission the right to disclosure of all relevant material has a broad scope and includes material which may only have a marginal bearing on the ultimate issues at the trial. Accordingly, a failure by the Crown to disclose disclosable material, may meet the threshold as [inaudible] to have tab 10 in the Allison bound volume of authorities, but could not possibly affect the reliability of the result reached in the trial or the overall fairness of the trial process. The defence may not be impaired as a result of the obligation to disclose not being complied with. It is obvious I submit that a finding that an accused right to disclosure has been violated does not end the analysis. A failure by the crown to disclose material may be incompatible with Article 6(1), but it by no means necessarily follows in my submission that the accused has not had a fair trial in terms of Article 6, or that there has been some other miscarriage of justice and I take up the point made by Lord Roger in McDonald found at tab 10, paragraph 77.
5	p1,01:23:00.900,01:24:14.170,spk_4,	True	Counsel: I've said most of what I want to say, but just one of two things, perhaps it has to be remembered, in my submission. Why in the first place outstanding cases are material which should be disclosed at all, and it is because there is a recognition that they are the sort of things the category of things which a defence counsel would wish to have. They're not unimportant matters which of course, ties in with the fact that in this case, the defence asked for them. So they are matters of some importance or else they would not be material which required to be disclosed. That in my submission is the very important starting point. And the second thing I would say, and only this, it is, I hesitate to use the word disingenuous and I mean no disrespect by it but for the Advocate Depute, to say that would have been finding into a dead body is not consistent with the position adopted by the Advocate Depute at the trial because he was not presented to the jury as a dead body, he was presented as someone who could be used on a matter of great significance.

5	p1,00:12:08.490,00:12:43.520,spk_0,	True	The Court: Mr Jackson, I mean, in a way, if it's already agreed this these outstanding charges fell within Lord Hope's definition of what was disclosable in McDonald in the past has almost been so isn't it? Because the obligation is to disclose these sort of things if they do materially weaken the Crown's case or material strength of the defence case and if they do either of those things almost by definition, if it's material.

And in Paragraph 82 it's set out that, clearly, if the appellants convictions had been revealed to the jury, this might have well been a disastrous consequence to adopt the Lord Justice Clark's description, but given what Miss Lin said in evidence and Miss Gilchrist's claim that she did not know what was meant by gear, and I am unable to say that cross-examination of the complainers about the outstanding drugs charges would inevitably have led to the Crown being permitted to cross-examine the appellant on his previous convictions, Information about the outstanding charges might therefore have played a useful part in the defence effort to undermine the credibility of the crime principal witness in charge two, At least that possibility, he says, Cannot be excluded. One cannot tell for sure what the effect of such cross-examination would have been, But applying the test suggested by Lord Justice General Clyde in Hogg v Clark, I cannot say that the council was unable to cross-examine in that way, it might not possibly have affected the jury's majority verdict on charge number three.

Reference is further made to Edwards to which I'll return to. However, Edwards, the European Court of Human Rights had to consider the question of whether or not the fact that evidence had been withheld from the defence at trial rendered the proceedings unfair. The same issue as is raised in the case in this case, the Court of Appeal in that case consider that the evidence that had been withheld in the light of all the material available and concluded that the evidence that had been withheld would have made no difference to the jury's verdict. The European Court of Human Rights held at the proceedings were not unfair, although there had been a defect in the trial at first instance that had been cured by fair and proper consideration of the evidence in the Court of Appeal.
5	p1,01:54:17.940,01:56:37.630,spk_5,	True	Counsel: Though it is not apparent that what was the appropriate test was a matter of argument before the judicial Committee and Lord Roger's test is not repeated in Sinclair, which is concerned with underscored statements. In the latter case, Lord Roger was in a position to conclude that the appellant's Solicitor Advocate quote would have been in a position to cross examine Mr Ritchie effectively, and the appellant's trial as a whole would have been fair, paragraph 50. Lord Roger's test has been used or abused in argument in this jurisdiction to suggest that the threshold of reversing the verdict of a jury in a non disclosure and analogous cases is low. That this may be a [inaudible] of Lord Roger's words in the context of determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice or we think an unfair trial, a robust test is required. The test of a real risk of prejudice to the defence was rightly, in our view, adopted in Kelly v Her Majesty Advocate, Paragraph 33. My Lords I turn to that part in a moment. But the second reason I say that the court adopted the wrong test can be shown that adopted the wrong test is the way in which it treated the previously withheld evidence in this case, in the context of the rest of the evidence. When the appeal court came to look at what was not disclosed at the trial, they appear to have taken a very strict approach, suggesting that the barrier has been raised. My Lords, it was never argued, referring to the first part of this point. It was never argued in the Appeal Court that there was a low threshold. What was argued was that, quite rightly, my submission and it's accepted by the crown was the threshold. The test is materiality. It could never be suggested that a piece of immaterial information such as who took photographs, could affect the outcome of anything. It maybe, if the person who took the photographs heard a comment by a complainer, for example, but generally speaking, it can't, its materiality. Except it was also accepted at the trial that the court must make some assessment of the withheld evidence in the context of the evidence that was learned at trial. 
5	p2,00:33:56.430,00:35:44.540,spk_2,	True	Counsel: By saying, Taking all the relevant factors together, I have reached the conclusion that in this case, the failures of The Lord Advocate's Representative to disclose information to the defence and the advocate deputy's reliance on the dock identifications of Gilchrist and Simpson were incompatible with the appellant's core Article 6 Convention Rights, taking together, they resulted in an unfair trial. So as I understand that a proper analysis of what His Lordship said, he makes it plain that it was the cumulative effect of all the factors taken together that led to the conclusion that the trial was not fair. And what I would invite this court to do is to come to the view, for purposes of clarity, for those who seek to seize upon that particular passage to which I have referred, is to come to the conclusion that His Lordship was not stipulating that the Hogg v Clark test should be used in order to determine whether there had been a miscarriage of justice or unfair trial. Rather what he was attempting to do, correctly in my respectful submission, was considering whether the non-disclosure of the outstanding charges was so unlikely to have been a practical effect that it could be left out of account all together, as opposed to whether it forms part of a cumulative evaluation. So, My Lords, in terms of My Lord and the chair's question about how this matter has come to pass, it has come to pass as a result of that particular remark by His Lordship in the paragraph to which I have referred being taken entirely out of context and applied to grounds of appeal, in particular additional evidence appeals, before the Criminal Appeal Court in Scotland.
5	p1,00:01:44.360,00:02:23.370,spk_2,	True	The Court: Well, there are two basic points I would have thought the first was whether there was a failure to disclose material which should have been disclosed. And that's accepted that the outstanding charges should have been disclosed. And I think it's accepted that the court below went too far in just dismissing the outstanding charges is something which could not possibly have any importance. And then there's a question whether the devolution issue and that's accepted, Mr. Prentice, I think, isn't it? So there we are and the question really is disposal, isn't it? And that's what we do next. Counsel: I mean what I do next is turn over four pages [inaudible] [laughing].

If, as here, the prosecution witness whose convictions have not been disclosed, is the only witness against a defendant, the defendant and his credibility and honesty are squarely an issue, and the jury are led to believe that the witness is of good character when such is not the case, then there is a strong ground for contending that the conviction is unsafe. And one can see that as an obvious example where non disclosure would have a quite significant impact upon the actual live issues at the trial.

6	p1,00:21:06.480,00:22:58.940,spk_4,	True	Counsel: It was not a piece of evidence like any other, it had a particular significance. Although this is not in the documents you have, it is not without note, because I checked it just recently that in dealing with this in his speech to the jury, the Advocate Depute described that piece of evidence as being significant. In that sense, he did give it some prominence because he speaks about and I quote, Mr Stronach said, that it was Stevie who asked him to take the car down to Kilmarnock. Now, if that is true, that is clearly a quite, significant piece of evidence because it would closely associate Stephen Alison with a specific vehicle on a specific day. A specific vehicle that you know, was found later that same specific day to contain a substantial quantity of cocaine. So the Advocate Depute was, to some degree and quite properly majoring on the fact that that linked him directly to a drug transaction. Everything else is just association with people who are in the drug business. So when the Advocate Depute says it is part of a circumstantial case, he's right. When he says it was not of such significance as to be decisive. If he means by that, was there a sufficiency of evidence without it? Then he may be right, but it should not be thought it was just a piece of circumstantial evidence like any other. It was a highly significant piece of circumstantial evidence because it was, as I repeat, the only direct link to a drug transaction. And therefore was that the jewel, as it were in that particular case.

6	p1,00:29:37.980,00:30:11.240,spk_4,	True	Counsel: So having the discrediting tools is even more important with a witness led under 259 because of the fact that he is not presently. It's the same, of course, and some force in this and I think this is the point Lord Roger was making to me. It is accepted by all parties that Mr Stronach was a liar and told many lies in his interview. And that is true. Clearly, the Crown case depended on him telling lies because, for example, in his statement, he said, Mr Allison told me to take the car, but he did, said he told me to take it for a different reason. The Crown wanted part of that and not part of it.

6	p1,01:54:17.940,01:56:37.630,spk_5,	True	Counsel: Though it is not apparent that what was the appropriate test was a matter of argument before the judicial Committee and Lord Roger's test is not repeated in Sinclair, which is concerned with underscored statements. In the latter case, Lord Roger was in a position to conclude that the appellant's Solicitor Advocate quote would have been in a position to cross examine Mr Ritchie effectively, and the appellant's trial as a whole would have been fair, paragraph 50. Lord Roger's test has been used or abused in argument in this jurisdiction to suggest that the threshold of reversing the verdict of a jury in a non disclosure and analogous cases is low. That this may be a [inaudible] of Lord Roger's words in the context of determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice or we think an unfair trial, a robust test is required. The test of a real risk of prejudice to the defence was rightly, in our view, adopted in Kelly v Her Majesty Advocate, Paragraph 33. My Lords I turn to that part in a moment. But the second reason I say that the court adopted the wrong test can be shown that adopted the wrong test is the way in which it treated the previously withheld evidence in this case, in the context of the rest of the evidence. When the appeal court came to look at what was not disclosed at the trial, they appear to have taken a very strict approach, suggesting that the barrier has been raised. My Lords, it was never argued, referring to the first part of this point. It was never argued in the Appeal Court that there was a low threshold. What was argued was that, quite rightly, my submission and it's accepted by the crown was the threshold. The test is materiality. It could never be suggested that a piece of immaterial information such as who took photographs, could affect the outcome of anything. It maybe, if the person who took the photographs heard a comment by a complainer, for example, but generally speaking, it can't, its materiality. Except it was also accepted at the trial that the court must make some assessment of the withheld evidence in the context of the evidence that was learned at trial. 
6	p1,00:32:31.400,00:33:15.970,spk_4,	True	Counsel: Now that is only as it were independent evidence to support what one knew anyway that there was evidence of association with people. The key part of Mr Stronach's evidence is the instruction he was given that Allison gave him to drive it. The car and the driveway earlier doesn't help in that at all. It only adds to the general level of association. I'm sure the crown prayed at an aide in the sense of it was part of the picture of association. But what they were really relying on in Stronach's evidence was Stronach says Allison, or the man who could be inferred to be Allison told me to drive the car to Ayeshire.
6	p1,00:19:23.450,00:20:03.410,spk_4,	True	Counsel: I would say is this and this in is my submission, the important point, the evidence that Stronach gave via his statement evidence which came from, as it were, the dead Stronach was of a different character than all the other pieces of circumstantial evidence. It was not just a piece of circumstantial evidence like any other. By that, I mean, it was the only piece of circumstantial evidence that directly linked the accused Allison to a drug transaction.
6	p1,00:20:40.780,00:21:04.020,spk_4,	True	Counsel: What Stronach [inaudible], was that on the day he had driven a car to Ayeshire and had been stopped with £30,000 worth of illegal drugs in his car. He was on that day driving on the instruction of a man whom the jury could infer was Mr Allison. So it was not a piece of evidence like any other.
6	p1,01:08:31.120,01:12:01.400,spk_6,	True	Counsel: At the bottom of page 23, line 23, You will have to decide whether what, should be John Stronach, said is credible and reliable, and in doing so, you will have to exercise great care. You will have to approach what he said with caution, and this is for a number of reasons. First of all, it's not evidence not given under oath and explains that, and he also explains that not had the opportunity to see him being cross examined at line, 16 and 17 not tested in Line 19, His lordship said, It seems pretty clear, accepted, really at all hands by both the crown and by the defence that in the course of what he told the police, he told many lies both about what happened on the 24th of November and about other matters. Much of what he said was contradicted by the contents of surveillance logs, that should be, and the other evidence, such as the searches of his house referred to in the drug inquiry or whatever. There is, however, a passage in which in which the crown do seek to rely. And that is what he said about a man called Stevie from Abran Hill, whom he described and said that he had asked him to take the car down to Kilmarnock. And the crown suggests first that you could infer that that was a reference to the first accused and that if you took the part that you if you accepted Mr Stronach's account, the man, Stephen made an arrangement and told him to take the car rejected his qualifications that it was for the purpose of selling the car and took along with other evidence and took that along with other evidence in the case. Then it pointed to the first accused being concerned in the supply of drugs the crown suggests to you. You could find comfort for accepting that particular part of his evidence in the interview, from the evidence of Detectives Sergeant Duncan Smith to the effect that he saw the usual car in the driveway of the house about lunchtime on the day. And also, I think the Advocate Depute referred to in evidence that on the 27th of November, the first accused took the passport of John Stronach to Airdrie Sheriff Court for all the the purpose of Mr Stronach being released on bail on the charge that related to the journey to Ayeshire and that has a compelling piece of evidence as well in my submission, and indeed that there was reference to the other journey linking the appellant. And it's described of as being a spectacular coincidence by the Advocate Depute if he were not connected. And that, of course, was precisely a matter for the jury to assess. But he was not presented by the crown it's ultimately a matter for the jury was not presented as an absolutely honest and truthful man, and indeed, while is not evidence, of course of what the Advocate Depute said in his speech. The acceptance of him being a liar would my submission have carried significant weight in the deliberation of the jury and the invitation to only rely on those parts of his evidence which were supported by other evidence, was another safeguard. So it was pretty clear in my submission. This is a witness who could not be trusted, but on key parts, the Crown invited the jury to accept evidence which was capable of being looked at elsewhere in my submission that there was plainly sufficient evidence without the 259 statement and the direct link because --
6	p1,00:11:02.870,00:11:32.960,spk_4,	True	Counsel: Without being anecdotal, there is a case due to come back to the appeal court in Scotland and precisely that point. Where a key witness it has now been discovered had an outstanding charge, and the witness against him in the outstanding charge is the person who gave evidence against in the trial. Now that case is in the pipeline to come back as a reference from the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission. So it gives a perfect example, if I may say so of that happening.

6	p2,00:29:53.430,00:30:19.610,spk_3,	True	The Court: Now the situation was that this was a very material thing in one sense, because here she was saying that she didn't know what year in this drug related sense was, and here was an outstanding charge relating to drug offences, and the only reply to that which had come from the Lord Justice Clark, If I remember rightly, was, Oh well it would have been very risky to raise that because you have put your, You would have been open to cross examination on your prior convictions --
6	p1,00:38:45.370,00:39:39.920,spk_4,	True	Counsel: I think the crown mentioned the fact that the outstanding charges of the Misuse of Drugs Act would not have been used in any event because they would have linked us into a man with a drugs business. I don't accept that. For this reason, it was never going to be in dispute. In the real world of the case, he was associated with people like that. So leading evidence that someone he associated with had a drug conviction was not that harmful because that was passed praying for. What was necessary was to say to the jury, you can't rely on this man, so I don't see how bringing out he would have had a previous conviction. A man, he would have been linked to a man who had outstanding charges for drugs matters would have been of terrible importance because the crown were proving that umpteen times.

8	p2,00:52:03.880,00:54:40.530,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Certainly, I take My Lord's point,  that in all of the jurisprudence in a number of different jurisdictions, that generally is the kind of approach that's taken in American jurisprudence, it's a reasonable prospect of a different result, for example. And is also consistent with the approach taken to fresh evidence in England and Wales, where the Court of Appeal considers whether the evidence given a trial might reasonably have affected the jury's decision to convict. So I take entirely Lord Brown's point in relation to that. The formulation of the various words used effectively amount to the same thing, that there has been prejudice caused to the appellant in his trial that might reasonably have affected a jury's decision to convict him. And, frankly, if the court in Scotland will keep the matter simple and consistent, it would be of use to everybody, including this particular court and, in my respectful submission, eventually alighting upon the world's, real risk of prejudice is a perfectly sensible and practical way of remedying any defect that has occurred in the original trial. My Lords I don't wish to take the matter any further unless My Lord's wish me to. But I would invite them, respectfully, in relation to what Lord Rodger has said, if issuing any judgement in this case, to make it clear that that those remarks to which we've been discussing have been taken out of context and should not be in future cases, and that may be of assistance both to counsel drafting grounds of appeal, and to the Court of Appeal. I would also invite them to come to the conclusion that the test alighted upon by the Appeal Court, namely real risk of prejudice, was entirely appropriate and was compliant with Article 6, and I would also invite them to come to the conclusion that in applying that test, they did so correctly, providing cogent reasons for their decision and that they were entitled to reach the conclusions that they did upon that material. And, My Lord's have heard what I have to say about issues relating to fresh evidence appeals, and how there can be a consistency between the various tests, all be it expressed somewhat differently in their terms, and on that basis, we to come to the conclusion the appeal has currently set out and argued today is without merit, and to refuse this appeal.
8	p1,00:13:43.290,00:14:14.840,spk_4,	True	Counsel: But what I think. I don't want to speak for the Advocate Depute and what the crown, I think are saying in this case that is all curable at this stage in the sense that when you look at it, you would say, well, it's not material in the same way as rightly or wrongly, the appeal court in Scotland cure, if i may use that word, the lack of disclosure of the previous convictions. The crown are inviting you to do the same with the outstanding cases and say, in lay terms, it didn't matter all that much.
8	p1,01:12:02.610,01:13:22.990,spk_6,	True	Counsel: No but it was there and in my submission, had the witness been presented is entirely credible. With nothing lurking around this at all, the position might have been different. But that's not the situation in my submission. This is a case where even applying the lowest possible threshold test to determine whether there has been an unfair trial, that test would not be met. There is no prejudice, I submit. In this case, it's not a case where there was not even no risk of prejudice. There was no prejudice but what?My learned friend Mr Jackson says that he wants all the bullets, but that my respectful submission appears to mean no more than to fire the last bullet into the dead body. There's no purpose to be achieved with that. That jury could be in no doubt of the stated status of Stronach. And in these circumstances, this would have added nothing to the significant body of material and successful attack upon the credibility of the witness, as recognised by the trial judge and therefore applying the two stage tests in my submission that the parents should fail in this, that this would not have affected the outcome of the trial at all.

8	p2,00:33:56.430,00:35:44.540,spk_2,	True	Counsel: By saying, Taking all the relevant factors together, I have reached the conclusion that in this case, the failures of The Lord Advocate's Representative to disclose information to the defence and the advocate deputy's reliance on the dock identifications of Gilchrist and Simpson were incompatible with the appellant's core Article 6 Convention Rights, taking together, they resulted in an unfair trial. So as I understand that a proper analysis of what His Lordship said, he makes it plain that it was the cumulative effect of all the factors taken together that led to the conclusion that the trial was not fair. And what I would invite this court to do is to come to the view, for purposes of clarity, for those who seek to seize upon that particular passage to which I have referred, is to come to the conclusion that His Lordship was not stipulating that the Hogg v Clark test should be used in order to determine whether there had been a miscarriage of justice or unfair trial. Rather what he was attempting to do, correctly in my respectful submission, was considering whether the non-disclosure of the outstanding charges was so unlikely to have been a practical effect that it could be left out of account all together, as opposed to whether it forms part of a cumulative evaluation. So, My Lords, in terms of My Lord and the chair's question about how this matter has come to pass, it has come to pass as a result of that particular remark by His Lordship in the paragraph to which I have referred being taken entirely out of context and applied to grounds of appeal, in particular additional evidence appeals, before the Criminal Appeal Court in Scotland.

8	p1,01:04:28.560,01:05:03.340,spk_6,	True	Counsel: I submit that it is necessary for the appellant to demonstrate that there was a real risk of prejudice, such that as that the overall fairness of the trial has been adversely affected and that must be based. I submit, on the basis that the defence has been deprived of opportunities to pursue additional lines of inquiry or garner additional evidence flowing from the undisclosed material.
8	p2,00:28:37.330,00:29:53.140,spk_2,	True	Counsel: And if I can just deal with that particular paragraph and, My Lords, will bear in mind that the case of Holland dealt not only with issues of non-disclosure but also dealt with issues of identification, particularly adult identification and also issues of previous convictions, if I remember correctly. And in Paragraph 82 it's set out that, clearly, if the appellants convictions had been revealed to the jury, this might have well been a disastrous consequence to adopt the Lord Justice Clark's description, but given what Miss Lin said in evidence and Miss Gilchrist's claim that she did not know what was meant by gear, and I am unable to say that cross-examination of the complainers about the outstanding drugs charges would inevitably have led to the Crown being permitted to cross-examine the appellant on his previous convictions, Information about the outstanding charges might therefore have played a useful part in the defence effort to undermine the credibility of the crime principal witness in charge two, At least that possibility, he says, Cannot be excluded. One cannot tell for sure what the effect of such cross-examination would have been, But applying the test suggested by Lord Justice General Clyde in Hogg v Clark, I cannot say that the council was unable to cross-examine in that way, it might not possibly have affected the jury's majority verdict on charge number three.

And they came to the conclusion that there was no support found for there having been any miscarriage of justice and there was no real risk of prejudice to the defence. It was in my respectful submission, that was a conclusion the court was entirely entitled to reach based on the material before it.

You will have to approach what he said with caution, and this is for a number of reasons. First of all, it's not evidence not given under oath and explains that, and he also explains that not had the opportunity to see him being cross examined at line, 16 and 17 not tested in Line 19, His lordship said, It seems pretty clear, accepted, really at all hands by both the crown and by the defence that in the course of what he told the police, he told many lies both about what happened on the 24th of November and about other matters. Much of what he said was contradicted by the contents of surveillance logs, that should be, and the other evidence, such as the searches of his house referred to in the drug inquiry or whatever. There is, however, a passage in which in which the crown do seek to rely. And that is what he said about a man called Stevie from Abran Hill, whom he described and said that he had asked him to take the car down to Kilmarnock. And the crown suggests first that you could infer that that was a reference to the first accused and that if you took the part that you if you accepted Mr Stronach's account, the man, Stephen made an arrangement and told him to take the car rejected his qualifications that it was for the purpose of selling the car and took along with other evidence and took that along with other evidence in the case. Then it pointed to the first accused being concerned in the supply of drugs the crown suggests to you. You could find comfort for accepting that particular part of his evidence in the interview, from the evidence of Detectives Sergeant Duncan Smith to the effect that he saw the usual car in the driveway of the house about lunchtime on the day. And also, I think the Advocate Depute referred to in evidence that on the 27th of November, the first accused took the passport of John Stronach to Airdrie Sheriff Court for all the the purpose of Mr Stronach being released on bail on the charge that related to the journey to Ayeshire and that has a compelling piece of evidence as well in my submission, and indeed that there was reference to the other journey linking the appellant. And it's described of as being a spectacular coincidence by the Advocate Depute if he were not connected. And that, of course, was precisely a matter for the jury to assess. But he was not presented by the crown it's ultimately a matter for the jury was not presented as an absolutely honest and truthful man, and indeed, while is not evidence, of course of what the Advocate Depute said in his speech. The acceptance of him being a liar would my submission have carried significant weight in the deliberation of the jury and the invitation to only rely on those parts of his evidence which were supported by other evidence, was another safeguard. So it was pretty clear in my submission. This is a witness who could not be trusted, but on key parts, the Crown invited the jury to accept evidence which was capable of being looked at elsewhere in my submission that there was plainly sufficient evidence without the 259 statement and the direct link because -- 
8	p1,00:52:24.220,00:53:35.270,spk_6,	True	Counsel: In my submission the right to disclosure of all relevant material has a broad scope and includes material which may only have a marginal bearing on the ultimate issues at the trial. Accordingly, a failure by the Crown to disclose disclosable material, may meet the threshold as [inaudible] to have tab 10 in the Allison bound volume of authorities, but could not possibly affect the reliability of the result reached in the trial or the overall fairness of the trial process. The defence may not be impaired as a result of the obligation to disclose not being complied with. It is obvious I submit that a finding that an accused right to disclosure has been violated does not end the analysis. A failure by the crown to disclose material may be incompatible with Article 6(1), but it by no means necessarily follows in my submission that the accused has not had a fair trial in terms of Article 6, or that there has been some other miscarriage of justice and I take up the point made by Lord Roger in McDonald found at tab 10, paragraph 77.
8	p1,01:19:03.040,01:19:56.350,spk_1,	True	Counsel: My Lords, with a certain diffidence, there is one small, limited additional point that may arise, and I stress may arise, and it's simply on the distinction whether there is a distinction between the concepts of unfair trial and miscarriage of justice. Now the reason I raise that although the appeal court appeared to take in this case the leading from unfair trial [inaudible], the miscarriage of justice, the reason I raised that Lord Osborne in the case of Fraser seemed to envisage that there were two separate halves which in some way could not meet. Now I fully appreciate that Fraser [inaudible] this court, in that there's an application for special leave, which I understand awaits the outcome of this case.
8	p1,01:54:17.940,01:56:37.630,spk_5,	True	Counsel: Though it is not apparent that what was the appropriate test was a matter of argument before the judicial Committee and Lord Roger's test is not repeated in Sinclair, which is concerned with underscored statements. In the latter case, Lord Roger was in a position to conclude that the appellant's Solicitor Advocate quote would have been in a position to cross examine Mr Ritchie effectively, and the appellant's trial as a whole would have been fair, paragraph 50. Lord Roger's test has been used or abused in argument in this jurisdiction to suggest that the threshold of reversing the verdict of a jury in a non disclosure and analogous cases is low. That this may be a [inaudible] of Lord Roger's words in the context of determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice or we think an unfair trial, a robust test is required. The test of a real risk of prejudice to the defence was rightly, in our view, adopted in Kelly v Her Majesty Advocate, Paragraph 33. My Lords I turn to that part in a moment. But the second reason I say that the court adopted the wrong test can be shown that adopted the wrong test is the way in which it treated the previously withheld evidence in this case, in the context of the rest of the evidence. When the appeal court came to look at what was not disclosed at the trial, they appear to have taken a very strict approach, suggesting that the barrier has been raised. My Lords, it was never argued, referring to the first part of this point. It was never argued in the Appeal Court that there was a low threshold. What was argued was that, quite rightly, my submission and it's accepted by the crown was the threshold. The test is materiality. It could never be suggested that a piece of immaterial information such as who took photographs, could affect the outcome of anything. It maybe, if the person who took the photographs heard a comment by a complainer, for example, but generally speaking, it can't, its materiality. Except it was also accepted at the trial that the court must make some assessment of the withheld evidence in the context of the evidence that was learned at trial. 
9	p1,00:13:43.290,00:14:14.840,spk_4,	True	Counsel: But what I think. I don't want to speak for the Advocate Depute and what the crown, I think are saying in this case that is all curable at this stage in the sense that when you look at it, you would say, well, it's not material in the same way as rightly or wrongly, the appeal court in Scotland cure, if i may use that word, the lack of disclosure of the previous convictions. The crown are inviting you to do the same with the outstanding cases and say, in lay terms, it didn't matter all that much.
9	p1,00:11:02.870,00:11:32.960,spk_4,	True	Counsel: Without being anecdotal, there is a case due to come back to the appeal court in Scotland and precisely that point. Where a key witness it has now been discovered had an outstanding charge, and the witness against him in the outstanding charge is the person who gave evidence against in the trial. Now that case is in the pipeline to come back as a reference from the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission. So it gives a perfect example, if I may say so of that happening.

9	p1,00:55:33.240,00:57:12.750,spk_6,	True	Counsel: Oh, and the quotation there by Lord Collins in Farrell, in which Lord Bingham sets out there. Thus, we have a clear and simple case in which the convictions of the prosecution witnesses, witness was not, were not disclosed when they should have been as a result of inadvertence or oversight. What is the effect of such non disclosure? If a defendant is convicted in evidence of convictions in the part of the prosecution witness, then comes to light? There is no simple and straightforward answer to that question. The answer will depend on the weight of the evidence in the case. Apart from the evidence of the witness whose convictions have not been disclosed, the greater the weight of the other evidence, the less significance, other things being equal. The non disclosure is likely to have had. The answer will also dependent on the extent to which the credibility and honesty of the prosecution witness, whose convictions have not been disclosed is at the heart of the case. If, as here, the prosecution witness whose convictions have not been disclosed, is the only witness against a defendant, the defendant and his credibility and honesty are squarely an issue, and the jury are led to believe that the witness is of good character when such is not the case, then there is a strong ground for contending that the conviction is unsafe. And one can see that as an obvious example where non disclosure would have a quite significant impact upon the actual live issues at the trial.

9	p1,02:15:39.670,02:16:26.750,spk_2,	True	The Court: It could be said, that that's just one step along the road to a conclusion. First of all, you have to identify this being a devolution issue that there was a breach by the Lord Advocate of the duty of disclosure, and that's accepted here, that the exit statements were not revealed and therefore that breach is there, and then you have flowing from that. The consequence of the fact that you didn't have this material was there was a loss of an opportunity to put that material to the witness at the trial. But that still leaves open the question as to what the net result of that is. The end result, I should say, is, and are we not taken back to the statutory test as to whether there was a miscarriage of justice?
9	p1,01:23:00.900,01:24:14.170,spk_4,	True	Counsel: I've said most of what I want to say, but just one of two things, perhaps it has to be remembered. in my submission. Why in the first place outstanding cases are material which should be disclosed at all, and it is because there is a recognition that they are the sort of things the category of things which a defence counsel would wish to have. They're not unimportant matters which of course, ties in with the fact that in this case, the defence asked for them. So they are matters of some importance or else they would not be material which required to be disclosed. That in my submission is the very important starting point. And the second thing I would say, and only this, it is, I hesitate to use the word disingenuous and I mean no disrespect by it but for the Advocate Depute, to say that would have been finding into a dead body is not consistent with the position adopted by the Advocate Depute at the trial because he was not presented to the jury as a dead body, he was presented as someone who could be used on a matter of great significance.

What I did say, and I've checked the notes with my colleague, is that I conceded they certainly identified the test, but I said they misapplied it. So in effect is, I suppose, the metaphor is having the correct horse but putting the wrong rider on its back, and as a result of that, it effectively neutralised the whole process. The second point, My Lords, very briefly, is I do not submit or accept that examining fresh evidence appeals in terms of The Criminal Procedure Act Scotland 1995 offers a great deal of assistance because, in relation to non-disclosure, for example, I think My Lord Brown I identified the point, perhaps, is also, and My Lord in the chair identified the point, I think it was, that a fresh evidence case is looking at something that was never before the court, whereas in a case such as this, where it's withheld evidence, it could in fact be more of the same, but the sort of material that could tip the balance where, for example, one witness says another witness is incorrect. But if there's a battery of witnesses who are not disclosed, say that witness was incorrect, that's not fresh evidence as such. It's quite a different, it's a different animal. So those are the only points I wish to raise with My Lord, My Lords.
9	p2,00:31:46.780,00:33:55.230,spk_2,	True	Counsel: And what he says is this, But the ultimate question is whether the trial as a whole was fair, And that question can only be decided by the same court, considering all its relevant strengths and weaknesses, including any breaches of specific safeguards and Article 6 together, It follows that although the issues relating to identification and non-disclosure were argued in sequence of the hearing before the board, in deciding whether the appellant can be said to have a fair trial, the board must consider all the relevant elements together. So, My Lords, in my respectful submission, with the Lord Rodger dealing with the issue of dock identification Paragraphs 47 to 63, non-disclosure of outstanding charges, Paragraphs 64 to 75, and the failure to disclose a remark made by a witness at Paragraph 76, he then correctly, in my respectful submission, at Paragraph 77, again sums up the position, saying this, It is now necessary to consider whether taken as a whole, the appellant's trial was fair in terms of Article 6(1), and that's with reference to Paragraph 43. So, in other words, in my respectful submission, he's claiming to speak for himself, but in the paragraphs to which I have referred, balancing the various factors, he had regard to all of these which had a bearing on the overall fairness of the trial and insofar as he refers to Hogg v Clark, in the context of determining the significance of one, of the supposedly unfair features, the non-disclosure of certain information in my respectful submission, no conclusion at all that can be drawn at this point in the opinion, that the proceedings were unfair solely on account of that one factor, and it has to be put into the context of what he said before and what he said later. And it was only when taking all of the matters together -- and he again at Paragraph 85 repeats that. The Court: Yes.

Because the obligation is to disclose these sort of things if they do materially weaken the Crown's case or material strength of the defence case and if they do either of those things almost by definition, if it's material.

So as I understand that a proper analysis of what His Lordship said, he makes it plain that it was the cumulative effect of all the factors taken together that led to the conclusion that the trial was not fair. And what I would invite this court to do is to come to the view, for purposes of clarity, for those who seek to seize upon that particular passage to which I have referred, is to come to the conclusion that His Lordship was not stipulating that the Hogg v Clark test should be used in order to determine whether there had been a miscarriage of justice or unfair trial. Rather what he was attempting to do, correctly in my respectful submission, was considering whether the non-disclosure of the outstanding charges was so unlikely to have been a practical effect that it could be left out of account all together, as opposed to whether it forms part of a cumulative evaluation. So, My Lords, in terms of My Lord and the chair's question about how this matter has come to pass, it has come to pass as a result of that particular remark by His Lordship in the paragraph to which I have referred being taken entirely out of context and applied to grounds of appeal, in particular additional evidence appeals, before the Criminal Appeal Court in Scotland.

10	p2,00:52:03.880,00:54:40.530,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Certainly, I take My Lord's point,  that in all of the jurisprudence in a number of different jurisdictions, that generally is the kind of approach that's taken in American jurisprudence, it's a reasonable prospect of a different result, for example. And is also consistent with the approach taken to fresh evidence in England and Wales, where the Court of Appeal considers whether the evidence given a trial might reasonably have affected the jury's decision to convict. So I take entirely Lord Brown's point in relation to that. The formulation of the various words used effectively amount to the same thing, that there has been prejudice caused to the appellant in his trial that might reasonably have affected a jury's decision to convict him. And, frankly, if the court in Scotland will keep the matter simple and consistent, it would be of use to everybody, including this particular court and, in my respectful submission, eventually alighting upon the world's, real risk of prejudice is a perfectly sensible and practical way of remedying any defect that has occurred in the original trial. My Lords I don't wish to take the matter any further unless My Lord's wish me to. But I would invite them, respectfully, in relation to what Lord Rodger has said, if issuing any judgement in this case, to make it clear that that those remarks to which we've been discussing have been taken out of context and should not be in future cases, and that may be of assistance both to counsel drafting grounds of appeal, and to the Court of Appeal. I would also invite them to come to the conclusion that the test alighted upon by the Appeal Court, namely real risk of prejudice, was entirely appropriate and was compliant with Article 6, and I would also invite them to come to the conclusion that in applying that test, they did so correctly, providing cogent reasons for their decision and that they were entitled to reach the conclusions that they did upon that material. And, My Lord's have heard what I have to say about issues relating to fresh evidence appeals, and how there can be a consistency between the various tests, all be it expressed somewhat differently in their terms, and on that basis, we to come to the conclusion the appeal has currently set out and argued today is without merit, and to refuse this appeal.

10	p2,00:50:20.260,00:51:02.940,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Can I say this, that, and then I can move on very quickly, in the various cases before the Appeal Court of the High Court of Judiciary, has always required non-disclosed material to meet some threshold of materiality. Whatever formulation is used in whatever number of different ways the court chooses to express itself, in my respectful submission, they all, I think it's Mr Jackson said in [inaudible] this morning, they very often all come to the same thing. They all come to whether there has been a real risk of prejudice to an appellant because it could hardly be said and not logical for someone to claim the trial was unfair, when in fact suffered no real prejudice. That would not be logical, in my respectful submission.

10	p1,00:12:08.490,00:12:43.520,spk_0,	True	The Court: Mr Jackson, I mean, in a way, if it's already agreed this these outstanding charges fell within Lord Hope's definition of what was disclosable in McDonald in the past has almost been so isn't it? Because the obligation is to disclose these sort of things if they do materially weaken the Crown's case or material strength of the defence case and if they do either of those things almost by definition, if it's material.

Yes. And my submission on disposal is that , if My Lords are with the appellant's, it should go back to the sheriff, if My Lords are with me, I would also invite My Lords to remit, to refuse the appeal, but to remit the matter back to the High Court. And I do that because if the appeal is refused, issues of seeking a warrant to arrest these two appellants will have to be dealt with, and I don't wish to trouble My Lords with any question relating to that. The Court: Thank you.
