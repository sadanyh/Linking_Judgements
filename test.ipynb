And that judgment made clear that, as I say chronologically in the lead up to the Children Act 1989 the courts decided that hearsay was not admissible in children proceedings. A parallel and similar decision was made in the Bradford case, in relation to proceedings in the juvenile court, the venue for care proceedings prior to implementation of the Children Act. And My Lord, I don't at this stage proposed necessary to go to those two cases. There's nothing that I seek to derived from them in particular, other than just setting us in the historical context of, here say not being admissible other than in wardship As we move towards the Act of 1989. What is of interest we submit is that those two cases H and K in particular led directly to a late amendment to the Children's Bill, adding Section 96 as we now see it, and it might give assistance.
