00:02:20.000,00:02:28.150,spk_2,"Sorry you say the child child. Of course, it's all the hildren were concerned, particularly with one. But we're concerned with the interests of all the children."

And of course, the position of the other children forms a very important part of the considerations which we propose to put before this court. Yes. Permission was granted by this court on the 15th of February. My Lord, this case concerns the proper approach to the decision as to whether a child should give oral evidence in care proceedings. The issue we submit gives rise to the need to balance competing interests. And it is the Appellant's submission that the Court of Appeal Authorities to date have not set the test correctly. My Lord, I do intend to I do propose to address the question of the work to be done by the family justice counsel. But if I may little later in the submissions, I am to make the background facts to this case to set out in the agreed statement of facts and issues, which is filed before the court. And unless this court at this stage wants any further assistance with regards to those background facts, I don't suppose to go to them now. When I come to look at the individual circumstances, this case after the legal arguments, then I'll go into more detail on those matters. May I begin by endeavouring to set these considerations in the appropriate historical context, which means going back a little way. But I hope not too far into history, and it really means looking at the position in 1988, 1989 concerns about children's evidence in family proceedings, were the documents show, on the political agenda at that stage. In the course of our written submissions, we have referred this court to a number of criminal provisions in order to give some counterbalance and some perspective the way in which matters have developed within crime and within family proceedings. The Criminal Justice Act in 1988 by virtue of Section 32 brought in live links for children's evidence given in criminal proceedings. But put over the issue of recorded evidence for the Pigott report, if I may use that shorthand to describe"

And in the written documentation in the Bundles, we've produced the case of Re(H), Re(K), which was the decision of the Court of Appeal in relation to, statutory proceedings, private law proceedings as the children. And that judgment made clear that, as I say chronologically in the lead up to the Children Act 1989 the courts decided that hearsay was not admissible in children proceedings. A parallel and similar decision was made in the Bradford case, in relation to proceedings in the juvenile court, the venue for care proceedings prior to implementation of the Children Act. And My Lord, I don't at this stage proposed necessary to go to those two cases. There's nothing that I seek to derived from them in particular, other than just setting us in the historical context of, here say not being admissible other than in wardship As we move towards the Act of 1989. What is of interest we submit is that those two cases H and K in particular led directly to a late amendment to the Children's Bill, adding Section 96 as we now see it, and it might give assistance.

Section 96 provides, Subsection 1, Where a child is called as a witness in any civil proceedings does not. In the opinion, the court understand the nature of the Subsection 2 applies the children's evidence. The child's evidence may be heard by the court if, in its opinion, he understands that his duty to speak the truth and he has sufficient understanding to justify his evidence being heard. That reversed the position prior to that section, whereby unsworn evidence of the child could not be received as a small as it were side marker. We would venture to suggest that the legislature, by passing that's Subsection, had in mind that the evidence of young children might be received by courts. I don't press that as a point of any particular strength, but it would seem that would have been in the Legislature's mind."

And so it would seem that that's the direction in which this Subsection was going. Subsection three, the general empowering provision for Statutory Instrument to be made, which I'll come to in due course, led to the children order that there were three hearsay orders, but they're in in terms of effect much the same. And it's 1993 Order, which now presides. Subsection 4 can be directed at different proceedings. It's Subsection 5, to which I draw particular attention."

On the face of the Subsection, it was specifically envisaged that recorded material might be deployed in family proceedings, and it's possible to demonstrate that that provision was made specifically with the Pigott report in mind. And I'll come to demonstrate that in just a moment, if I may. But just pausing there, at that point in history, we have before the Legislature issues in relation to children's evidence being considered both in relation to criminal proceedings and family proceedings. And it's the backdrop to these submissions that one can see moving on through the last 25 years or so, the enormous thought energy and care has been applied to child witnesses in criminal proceedings. But that we submit has not been mirrored in family proceedings. Well, may I take a moment just to look in a little more detail at the Pigott report, which is in the Authorities Bundle, which is open before the court at tab 43. Again just just coming at this from the historical perspective, the use of video links at live links not recorded evidence the use of live links was brought in for the first time. As I've said by section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 we produced the implementation order. I don't need to go to it, but it's relevant to note that that came into effect in January of 1989. So from January of 1989 the criminal courts first began to receive evidence from children by way of a live video link, children under 14 at that stage. Before that his own judge, Pigott in June of 1988 was asked to look into the prospect of using recorded evidence and, as we see from the face of the Pigott report immediately behind tab 43 the committee reported in December of 1989. So the relevance of course of that"
00:11:26.830,00:11:28.530,spk_1,"chronology is"
00:11:28.530,00:11:46.270,spk_3,"that the advisory group and the courts had virtually no experience of the impact of live links when they produced this report. The preliminary view of the Pigott reports are to be found at Paragraphs 2.13."
00:11:49.850,00:11:50.490,spk_1,"Well,"

00:11:55.320,00:14:12.440,spk_3,"But if I may, I'll just, go at this stage just a view of the preliminary reports of the Pigott committee at Paragraph 2 (13) at page 16. We acknowledge that report respects the possibility of giving evidence by live television link from outside the court in trials of violence and sexual offences, which has been available to the children under the age of 14, by section 32 of the 88 Act has improved matters, direct confrontation with the accused can be avoided, and the pressures of speaking in public about embarrassing matters reduced. Its too early to make a thorough assessment of this innovation, which has been carefully monitored and evaluated, and in my position, one has to bear in mind when one evaluates the balance of the advice of that committee that that was the state of knowledge in relation to what was clearly an innovation within criminal proceedings that had just got underway. My Lords, the part of the Pigott report, which has found expression mostly in the family cases, is that Paragraph 2 (12) on page 15 and that's the part that's quoted in the Paragraph is quoted in full by Lords Justices Warren Wilson in the Court of Appeal decision in this case, the present case before this court. And it's the one from which, if there's any resonance through the Court of Appeal Authorities, as to the impact on children of giving given evidence, it's the source of that sound effect. Paragraph 2.12 were satisfied that the majority of children are adversely affected by giving evidence Trials for serious offences under existing circumstances and laws if I made the expression under existing circumstances is crucial because, in effect, existing circumstances was the naked presentation of children in the witness box before a judge or jury, without any measures to prepare them, protect them or to the system after giving evidence that those were the existing circumstances being considered and then they go on the rest of Paragraph 2 (12) to summarise the expert evidence being received as to the potential stress and adverse effects on children are being presented to a court in that circumstance."
00:14:12.470,00:14:17.540,spk_0,"Do we know? what the source of that evidence was?"
00:14:17.550,00:14:30.690,spk_3,"Yes, the appendix. The appendix which sets out the contributors. It's not an appendix. It's certainly at the back."

Yeah, but I would respectfully submit that when one examines in a little more detail what was said within the section I'm at in the Pigott report, more was being said than just that. A bold statement that children giving evidence will cause them harm. Can I go on to Paragraph 2 (15) And the background 2 (15) really began with the criminal case of Woolwork, which was the case where the Lord Chief Justice said that children the evidence of a child aged five could not be received, and the concern that was that the evidence of young children wasn't being received either because of legal practise or because parents or guardians were not content to their children to go before a court without any form of protection. So if I can just read six lines or so into Paragraph 2 (15). We also received evidence and police officers and social workers that many hundreds of cases cannot be pursued successfully each year because children seem unlikely to make effective or legally competent witnesses under under present circumstances. As a result, some child victims are left with feelings of anger, resentment, frustration and even guilt, which many experts believe could be to some extent dispelled by legal procedures which enable them to speak fully and freely and when judged against the progression of Court of Appeal cases in family law as to the effect on children giving evidence, that we respect, that suggested the most interesting comments because it shows that under appropriate circumstances, there is the possibility of good effect arising from children being given a voice in proceedings clearly criminal proceedings in this context. But it's a comment which could be more widely applied and at 2 (18) just over the"

00:16:48.070,00:18:31.760,spk_3,"five lines up the bottom of page, we also think that the quality of evidence that children give on cross examination will improve where this takes place in informal surroundings as soon as can practically be arranged. So that's the early recording of the child's evidence, which was then to be used in chief. But again, looking to the fact that despite the inauspicious position has presented in 88, 89 the appropriate use of technology and care and consideration could give rise to considerable amelioration for children in giving evidence in proceedings. And again, it's slightly to the side of this case. But just a note that a Paragraph 2 (22) at the foot of page 19 the committee recorded that, In terms of criminal proceedings, of course, they say, we agree that cross examination is essential. And again at 2 (24) at the head of the page, making a similar point. We would be seriously concerned about this matter if it were proposed and tied to excuse the child from cross examination. Some of them just standing where we were at that stage. There was clearly expressed concern about children giving evidence, as was the practise at that time in criminal proceedings, but very much of you that that was something which could be ameliorated.

The last few lines deal with Subsections 5 and 6 will provide the necessary flexibility. The Lord Chancellor's Power will thus be expert sizeable to provide for the admissibility of statements made orally in writing any form prescribed by the order or by any means of any form of recording, for example, audio or videotape. And so that throws the consideration little wider than is apparent from the section, which simply talks about any form of recording and demonstrates that video recording was plainly in consideration. And then just on the opposite page. When Mr Simms responds to attorney general, in the second Paragraph of his response, he asks the question, What progress is the Pigott committee making?"

So, what was happening within Pigott was very much before the Legislature, when dealing with Section 96 I would suggest that it's legitimate, supposed that, given the chronology, which is that this all happened very late in the progress of the Children Bill. We're now in October 1989 received royal assent in November 1989 the the legislative work considering globally as it were, the question of how children's evidence might be presented within proceedings, whether criminal, family. And it's legitimate, I suggest to suppose that they were, as it were, putting over the question of more detailed provisions for children until period reported, but foreshadowing it by way of Section 96 5."

Nobody thought it was a problem in civil proceedings, and it was only then that it became clear that it was a problem, and so it was necessary to put something into the Children Bill to cater for that. And although Pigott was going on, it was going on in another part of the forest to do with criminal proceedings. Where there's always been known to be a"
00:22:15.480,00:22:59.660,spk_3,"problem, we'll see. Perhaps what I suggest is that what we see from Re H, K. It's certainly right that it had been going on before receiving hearsay evidence, but a bit, if I may put it this way, a bit of a mishmash. It wasn't quite clear whether it was by consent from the individual parties or by lawful authority. So it certainly needed clarification. And I would venture to suggest that it goes a little further because we, the Section 95 (6) goes at the 65 goes a little further because we can see that it was specifically directed towards in the statute recording, look at the Solicitor General video recording, and by the response to pick up being there so accepted a degree speculative.

That was the other part of the background, which is, you know, your suggestion that the order was leaving things up in the air.

And rising from that has been the need for the Court of Appeal to develop the test. Some of those turning if I made to the test as it is now, it doesn't seem to me there's any great degree of dispute between these parties before this court as to what the standard the test is at the moment.

But we accept that encapsulates the key elements of the test as they had been as it has been developed by the Court of Appeal."
00:29:05.890,00:29:09.760,spk_4,"Are they Absolute? I mean,"
00:29:10.530,00:29:11.350,spk_3,"is"
00:29:11.360,00:29:43.630,spk_4,"the penultimate one, an absolute. What happens if that's an absolute what the proceedings can't go ahead or they go ahead automatically on the basis of Hearsay evidence. However much hearsay would otherwise, for special reasons, be desirable, cross-examination with special reasons are desirable?"
00:29:44.960,00:30:14.210,spk_3,"I don't know that I could suggest that it is absolute. But if one traces the word oppressive through these Authorities, it is a very strong consideration described by Lord Justice Wilson as the yardstick of oppression. So you described as the yardstick by which the case will be decided. And if if the child judge's conclusion is that it would be oppressive, then the child will not be called to give evidence. And the case will proceed by way of hearsay without cross examination."
00:30:15.030,00:30:47.720,spk_4,"Yes, but in deciding whether it's oppressive, you simply look at the effect on the child. I ask that because the third factor suggests that can be a particular justification for requiring the child to give all evidence, and so does the last one. The welfare of the child is irrelevant but not paramount consideration. In other words, if ultimately there's a discretionary exercise, it must involve some balance between these factors."
00:30:49.160,00:30:49.570,spk_1,"Yeah,"
00:30:50.950,00:31:10.110,spk_3,"it certainly is expressed as requiring a balance, and it may be most sensible if if I take the call to the key passages of the key Authorities, which set this out because all this is trying to digest points which are made in different ways in different cases, and so one only really gets the full sense of it by looking at those particular passages."
00:31:11.070,00:31:38.290,spk_4,"I think the gist of your case is that the balance is really struck and by the second and the fourth factors mainly in principle, is undesirable, and in principle it's very it's rare and that's so to speak. The balance is tilted heavily in that direction from the outset."
00:31:38.300,00:32:58.320,spk_3,"Yes, we would say that if you if you have a test which says that the outcome will be rare and then the very test itself is predicting the degree, the outcome and cannot therefore be a fair test, it should be. It should be neutral. The test itself should be neutral as to outcome. So it is wrong in principle to have a test which express rarity as part of the very formulation. And we made criticism of the second bullet point. There's a starting point that is well, it was characterised by Lord Justice Reimer in the Court of Appeals in this case as a presumption, and we certainly submit it has that flavour and that character that that is a starting point. If it's a starting point, it's a presumption. And if there were any doubt about that, when we move on to a particular justification, we submit that one can probably ask. Well, who is to do the justifying? And the answer must be. It's for the respondent father to show a particular justification is why, despite the starting point, despite the expression of rarity, the child should have to give evidence, oral evidence. And so that, again is an indication that there's a presumption which has got to be rebutted by the father. Why"
00:32:58.320,00:33:16.430,spk_4,"shouldn't there be a presumption? I mean, as long as it's capable of being rebutted, and as long as the factors which lead to it being rebutted are clearly identified, I'm not sure they are expressly identified in these six bullet points."
00:33:19.210,00:34:29.850,spk_3,"We know two complaints about that. Firstly, that even if this court would conclude that the test itself is not flawed it's, by putting Principal, it doesn't have sufficient articulation of the particular counterbalancing counterbalancing factors to be born in mind. And so that is a serious default of itself. And the what is entirely absent from the Authorities is any specific expression of needing to weigh the competing convention rights of article and the child herself will have Article 6 and Article 8 rights. Similarly, the parents and on the facts of this case and in many, many other cases, the Article 6 and 8 rights of siblings. And I was going to move a little later, so a bit more about siblings. But those are all key competing considerations, and at the very least, they need direct expression with any appropriately formulated test."
00:34:30.700,00:34:42.050,spk_0,"Is there something else? A. As I understand you, Mr Geekie, you're saying, you you object to a starting point if it's elevated to a presumption at least,"

00:35:04.260,00:35:17.440,spk_0,"Yes, exactly. And your further criticism is that what this doesn't do is set out what the relevant factors are being weighed in the balance. So you've got 3 criticisms. Yes,"

00:35:20.580,00:37:15.830,spk_0,"Sorry, Sorry. I've got another question. Before you get into the factors, you you point to the Article 6 and Article 8 rights,  of all the people involved in the proceedings, the complaining child, the other children, the mother, the father and so on. Is there also sitting in there a public interest in the sense of or a general interest in the sense of not only these children, not only these families, but other children? Because if one has a state of the law, which makes it very difficult for children to complain about what they have suffered generally Well, then that would have implications not only for these children in this family, but for children generally. Were it to be the case, for example, that the expectation was that any child who complained that a parent or somebody close to them had abused them in some way, could be summoned to give evidence, and therefore they had to be warned almost straight away. Well, if you're going to tell me this, I shall have to take it further. And you might be called to give evidence if one had that situation. Well, Then one could easily speculate that it would be a serious deterrent for children making complaints along with all the other deterrents that there are, that that would be relevant to the balance in any particular case, is there a general interest as well as particular ones? It's taken me a long time to ask you that question, but that's what I'm trying"
00:37:15.840,00:39:35.260,spk_3,"I believe we have a firm answer to that, so I hope it's a satisfactory one. The position your ladyship postulates, applies already in relation to a child and criminal proceedings that that if the child is asking all the investigator feels obliged to explain, then the child would have to be told you'll probably have to give oral evidence at a criminal trial. If this gives rise to an allegation of crime, you're likely to have to give evidence. And indeed, the very ABE interview in this case starts off as early on in it, a discussion with a child about the fact that you may have to give evidence in a court. So insofar as there is that concern as to the impact upon children, generally, it's within the system, and it's difficult to see why an investigator or social worker would be able to put on the child's behalf, filter out what you might have to do with in criminal proceedings of what you might have to do with in family proceedings. But secondly, perhaps more importantly, we resist very firmly any suggestion that the anyway behind our underlying disappear. All these submissions is a suggestion that children should have to give evidence in criminal proceedings more often. And the local authority directly say in their case, Statement of Case, that if this appeal is correct, then it will lead to a presumption that a child should have to give evidence. And we with great respect say absolutely not. All we are saying, is that when considering this issue, all competing interests should be evaluated from a level starting point because the competing interests are separately so important that it's wrong to rank them prior to consideration. And it's not convention compliant, We will say anyway will develop in a moment, and so you start from a level basis, and that does not lead to conclusion that there'll be a presumption that a child should give evidence what a court will do, what the individual judge will do in the individual"

It is the position which I'm advancing before this court to create a situation where a responsible investigator might say something which inhibits the flow of information.

But I submit that when when the investigator, social worker, police or whatever is first with the child, one can't know whether or not it's going to lead to criminal proceedings. And"

And I would suggest that what we're proposing in this appeal need not and should not lead to a situation where an investigator needs say anything different or more threatening to the child about the possibility of having to give evidence. All that being said here is that when coming to make a decision, a family judge, we'll have to look at all relevant considerations. And I do reiterate it's no part of these submissions to say that the welfare of the child will not form a very important part of that consideration. So there will be every opportunity for welfare decisions to be taken into account. And it may turn out looking back two or three years hence that empirically, the outcome is that it's still a rarity for children to give evidence. If individual judges make decisions such that they consider that the balance is struck in favour of Hearsay evidence, then then in sense, in terms of how we present this appeal, so be it. We're not. We're not driving at outcomes. My submission related to this individual cases like this. That's another point we're not. It's not driving as an outcome whereby more children have to give evidence.

And that's something to which we've given considerable consideration as to whether or not we should make a claim that an Article 6 right has any greater claim in a balancing exercise and after consideration. It was our decision, I hope not wrongly, but our decision that it would not be appropriate to seek to argue that the father's Article 6 right in a situation such as this had any prior claim in relation to Article 8 rights and really two reasons underlying that decision are firstly, I believe the most appropriate language is to say that although after 60 non qualified right is not an absolute right, and so if that's the law in relation to Article 6, it begins to make the position difficult to claim a prior position for Article 6. But secondly, the Article 6 rights are in these cases spread across the parties and because the child, the child witness, has her Article 6 rights and the siblings have their Article 6 rights to a fair hearing. And so in any event, there's going to be a levelling between the parties in relation to their Article 6 rights. And indeed, we've so far, I've just been addressing the situation where one has a child, witnesses who are parties. One also, of course, has to think about child witnesses who are strangers to litigation. They will have rights to engage in the litigation. Are"

Obviously, my colleagues will probably understand that in care proceedings, children are the children who are the subject of the care proceedings are parties to the proceedings. So clearly their rights are an issue in the proceedings, and the proceedings will be the determination of their civil rights as much as they will be the Determination, in fact, in relation to the father. In this particular case, he has no civil rights in relation to the particular witness about whom we're talking. His civil rights are in relation to the other children, where the parties, the proceedings, but in other family proceedings. Of course, children are not necessarily parties. But would you be drawing any distinction between them?"

If the child is that if I can use expression of stranger child, then then that might well inform the weight, which the trial judge gives to particular factors. In that case, it may be a child's a stranger child. Then, depending on the particular facts of that case, one might decide that some facts have less weight. In that case, they might have the child was a party. It's just a question of it needs to be looked at in the individual case."

00:53:40.130,00:54:33.150,spk_0,"sorry. That's what I'm challenging you about because in private law proceedings, child's future may be an issue, even though the child is not a party to the proceedings. A stranger child I would take to be a child whose future is not an issue in the proceedings but may have relevant evidence to give. So we've got three different sorts of child. We've got the child who is the true stranger in the sense that her future is not going to be affected by the outcome of these proceedings, or at least not directly affected. There's the child whose future will be affected but who is not a party to the proceedings and the child whose future is affected. Who is a party to the proceedings. We've got those three categories. Are you drawing any distinction between the party non party? That's a technicality of family proceedings?"
00:54:33.160,00:56:51.430,spk_3,"I accept that and accept it rises very often. It's not some unusual situation, and it needs to be encompassed. But the our argument is in favour of a test, which says, if I can just use a shorthand at this stage or competing claims and rights must be looked at from an even starting point and trial judges, when considering any of the three positions that my lady deposits will have to look at the position of the individual child or children, which may fulfil different functions in one case and consider their position within that test. And so, if you have if you if you have a set of care proceedings where there is only one child, only one child in the family, only one child involved in any way at all who is the Who is alleging abuse? And so she is the child witness and she is the subject of the proceedings, you won't have to consider any sibling rights, and you will give an intense focus upon her Article 6 and Article 8 rights. If you have a case where the only witness to an event is child is not a party to the proceedings. The trial judge. When evaluating the evidence as to whether or not that child would have to give evidence, I would have to consider that she has a right to family life into privacy. So she has Article 8 rights and would have to evaluate those. But the trial just wouldn't have to worry about the one of the troubling aspects of these cases, of course, the future impact upon family relations if it is a subject child. And so the range of factors to be considered by the trial judge within the same test may not be so broad or troubling when one is considering a stranger child. So it's the What is different, I would submit, is the range of factors to be considered by the trial judge. Not not the overarching"
00:56:51.440,00:56:52.900,spk_0,"test,"
00:56:52.910,00:57:00.680,spk_3,"which is ultimately the framework within which the judge will decide whether that child in those circumstances should give evidence in that case,"
00:57:01.710,00:57:09.840,spk_0,"why the Article 8 rights of a stranger child engaged at all? Any more than any other witness?"
00:57:14.530,00:57:24.250,spk_3,"Because of her right to privacy and because of a particularly delicate nature of an inquiry. I'm assuming an allegation of sexual abuse in this exchange, because"
00:57:24.260,00:57:34.210,spk_0,"We do have to also think about other types of allegations. But let's leave it with the allegation of sexual abuse. Wouldn't that be true of anybody adult or child?"
00:57:40.280,00:59:26.160,spk_3,"Yes, it it may be, but when one is considering a child, you have to. The court has a responsibility to consider that child's welfare in a way that they courts often have to consider welfare for older witnesses who may be learning disabled. And it does. It does crop up in different situations, and those young people who may be over 18 but have learning difficulties equally would need careful and special consideration. And so estimate the the the child witness who is not not a party to proceedings does have Article 8 rights to privacy because of the nature of the allegations and the intrusive nature of the testing of evidence in this sort of case. But depending on the particular facts, a particular case a judge might come to a different decision if the child were a stranger child, if the child were the only subject child of those proceedings. And so when all that I would respectfully submit is consistent with an intense focus on the comparative importance of the specific rights being claimed, that any potential witness who can articulate a claim is deserves that intense focus and and that's what should be undertaken and their status within the proceedings will be a factor and may or may not influence the decision as to whether or not they should give evidence."

How, as you rightly put it if we're looking at Article 6, all the children, both the adults, have got Article 6 rights that are engaged in this case, so they're all entitled to a fair hearing in the determination of those rights. And the only question is what's fair If you introduce Article 8 that adds a different level of complexity, which may vary as between the strangers to the action and the parties to the action? That's the only point I'm putting to you. It's not identical to the straightforward battle between Article 8 and Article 10. That there was in that was complicated"

But each of them is so fundamental that we submit there is no warrant to do other than to begin with and even approach. And although a number of conventional authorities are put before this court illustrating different points that there is no warrant, we would submit from any of them for anything to say that one interest has a prior claim over another.

That's why I come back to our urgent claim that we're not seeking to make it more or less likely, that a child should give evidence. It may well be otherwise. But there is because of the sensitivity and the importance of the conflicting claims. You have to start from an even point and it's set out in our documentation. I perhaps don't need to spend too long at this stage. But just picking up my Lord, Lord Browne's points right off and 6 a little further. The the Article 6 right is an unqualified but not an absolute right. But the right when one analyse it through the convention Case law is to overall fairness in the proceedings. So the court has to stand well back and look at the overall effect within the proceedings. And it's for that reason that if one looks at the various convention cases on that subject, in some instances, hearsay evidence is admissible in some instances, not it doesn't track the Article 6 right doesn't translate into any necessary result. One has to look at the overall fairness and that's why we say that one has to measure each of these factors in an even way. And"

Because I think you're saying that as soon as you start to measure them, you you said you look at how strong they are in the particular case, the intrinsic merits in each case, so that the only sense in which they're equal is that on paper, they're all there in black and white. But in practise, as soon as one looks at the facts and as soon as one bears in mind that was dealing with a child's evidence, you're likely to say, aren't you that there is in most if not all, cases are very strong. I wish to avoid a child being obtrusively cross examined, at least in the traditional sense, so that I haven't you got You may say well that there is how strong it is, according to the child and the age and so on.

Perhaps I should just go through the Paragraph in order and then come to that in just a moment. A pack of 28 in our view, references in the family jurisprudence to which Mr G. Particular object and then the starting point is that child's oral evidence is undesirable and that it is rare to order it don't do no more than represent This court's concern today is expressed in all four of the Authorities about the emotional health of a child subjected to cross examination in these circumstances and its prediction of the likely decisiveness of that feature in striking the balance in most cases, just pausing there, if I may, in my submission one if one is looking at the cases overall and accepting Miss Brannigan summary of the test one cannot unhitch those comments from the particular Justification comment, which comes from Lady Justice Smith in l M. And the first point on that is that if one has a particular Justification, I submit that that casts a burden on the Respondent.  Lord Justice is War and Wilson.Then speak about the likely decisiveness of that feature. Which is the point, My Lord Lamont has just touched upon. The very test includes a prediction. Would you"

Then the judgment deals with the question of whether or not they're per incuriam. I don't go to that part, but picking it up four lines from the bottom. The court can hardly be said to have been unaware. For example, the right of the adult accused by the child have overall a fair hearing. Indeed, we've already in effect described, such as being an elementary feature of the central dilemma. That's the touches upon the second element of our complaint, which is that the the particular features of the tests are not sufficiently articulated. We would submit is not sufficient to infer or assume that all the relevant matters would be in the mind of a trial judge. They need to be set out clearly and then, finally, furthermore, the analysis of the issue through the prism of convention rights has offered it to us does not appear to us to generate any significantly different effects from that of existing jurisprudence as we interpret it, founded firmly as it is upon opinion as to what the welfare of the child is likely to demand. But I submit that that falls on the wrong side of the expression of the test because it is giving prior ranking to that future. And it is giving it primacy, if not paramount Status and in the context of the other competing interests, that is not appropriate and it is not consistent with the Re F approach. And I would respectfully submit This isn't a question of nitpicking over the words. When one looks at the way the test is phrased, it is very, very clearly expressed.

The reality is the position which pertains in 99 out of 100 of these sorts of cases. It is only in very unusual case that a complainant, if I can use that word from criminal law, will give evidence the child would give evidence, the child will give evidence and then goes on to the door swinging analogy, which again is something I'll come to a little later now, as Lord Justice Rimer says in the Court of Appeal's judgment.

Argument is encapsulated in the suggestion that if a child is not called, there is a concomitant weakening of the local authority case, adopting if I may, Lord justice rhymes approach that is on reflection, a highly unsatisfactory situation. In this type of litigation, we're not engaged in straightforward, adversarial civil litigation. We were engaged, of course, with the court being charged with the decision is the welfare of the child. So if the door swings, one swing of the door is that the judge has to reject an allegation that is possibly true because she, the judge has not heard from the child. Then the system may well be failing. It's not satisfactory. A system intended to settle disputes between individuals but rather to promote the welfare of children may come back the wrong decision for lack of evidence, which could have been put before the"

But the present arrangements have a hidden bias. The present emphasis is in favour of not hearing from the child, and that reminds me that creates a hidden bias in favour of accepting the hearsay account of the child. Once the decision is made in an individual case not to receive oral evidence, I submit that that decision gives rise to a pressure on the record to accept the child's account. A reason for saying that is that unless the account is self evidently flawed, a judge who rejects an account without hearing from the child risks are serious injustice to that child one only need to think about the case of a competent teenager, with the social worker coming back afterwards to say the judge didn't accept her account and the child saying, But the judge didn't hear me. And so if a case is to proceed on the basis that there is an even chance that the court will reject the account if the child doesn't give evidence, the court needs to give the most serious consideration to the consequences of doing so without hearing from the child. And if one looks at the dilemma from that perspective, it does, in my submission, create for a judge of pressure or hidden bias in favour of accepting the account of the child. Once the decision is made not to hear from that child because of the risk of grave injustice, that child,"

And so I've earlier resisted the proposition that this is a submission globally, which is to have more children give evidence, and I would look at this to support that, to say that the tensions and sensitivities of this as such that underlying if there is the risk of actually doing harm to the child, perhaps unintended, certainly unintentionally. But the the emphasis or not hearing from the child, risking harm to that child or risking a bias in favour."
01:25:54.620,01:26:07.880,spk_2,"There are risks anyway. Doesn't all this simply underline or all council? Very well aware of huge responsibilities that fall on family judges who have to decide these things?"

But But if the if the arrangements are such that the expectation is the child doesn't give evidence that that it's such an important decision in the setting up of a case in the case management that if the present system can be seen to not be doing justice and to have inherent risks, then in the context of the anxieties Your Lordship articulates, it is a negative contribution to helping judges sort that out and accept the context your Lordship articulates. But the the judges are entitled to have a test, which gives them full flexibility, a full discretion to make sure all relevant matters are taken into account and that there is no bias one way or the other."

Looking at the relevant section in the Act of Care Order may be made if the court satisfy the child concerned is suffering or likely to suffer a significant harm. How does that work in practise when a judges assessing the evidence does the judge make positive findings one way or the other as to whether the evidence is accepted?

01:28:19.850,01:28:33.040,spk_2,"The local authority has set out in the clearest possible terms the findings effect, which it is seeking. And it's going to be the family judges duty to make findings on those allegations."
01:28:33.050,01:29:24.240,spk_3,"Yes, and just to flesh out the structure of the proceedings in a little more detail in just a moment, the convention often is that where there are hotly disputed facts, there will be a split hearing. The court will decide the contested facts first on a fact finding mission before coming later to consider the welfare outcome for the child in the light of those findings and applying the welfare check list. So this is set up as a split hearing. The fact finding hearing. Did these things happen or not? And when the judge has made that determination, if the local authority has approved the case, then judgment due course will go on to look at the welfare considerations and asked what the future for these children should be, all of them in the light of those facts as found, and any other assessments that might have taken place on the basis of those facts as found."
01:29:25.610,01:30:01.730,spk_0,"Of course, if the stark situation that you have put to My Lord only really arises where your only basis for thinking that there is a an appreciable risk of harm to children in the future is because a particular event has happened in the past. That's the situation in which you have to have found on the balance of probabilities that that event took place in order to justify your prediction. That goes back to the case of Re H in 1996, recently reaffirmed in this court."
01:30:01.740,01:30:02.330,spk_3,"I believe so,"
01:30:02.510,01:30:03.160,spk_0,"yes"
01:30:03.830,01:30:25.340,spk_3,"And yes, the further sophistication is that one may be looking at simply findings of fact as to whether or not this thing happened and then going on to say in the light of that is the threshold, as My Lord just read it out. Satisfied. But one might be doing both together. It depends upon the range of facts before the court."
01:30:26.210,01:32:07.310,spk_0,"Could I just mention something else just so that it's at the forefront of everybody's mind as we're considering these very difficult issues? And that is that it's not entirely right to say that the judge has not heard from the child. We're not talking hearsay evidence as in a witness statement given by the child or, as in other people's accounts, of what the child has said to them most of the time, I mean some of the time one is. But in most of these cases, we are talking about a video recorded interview done under the achieving best evidence guidelines, which everybody is able to watch. And if it's done properly, it's done either jointly or individually, by a police officer and a social worker who have been trained to do this in such a way as not to put leading questions to the child. Not to put words into their mouths, not to, well to counteract any suggestion that they are playing upon the suggestibility of a child witness quite, in other words, taking a great deal more care than is normally taken an ordinary examination in chief of an adult witness as a general proposition. So we're mostly talking about, although it's technically here, say it is actually a direct recording of what the child has said in an interview of that nature to police officer and all social worker, Am I not right?"
01:32:07.500,01:32:08.070,spk_3,"Except that it's"
01:32:08.090,01:32:09.040,spk_0,"mostly what we're talking"
01:32:09.040,01:32:12.320,spk_3,"about where I've had a shorthand and not the child. Of course,"
01:32:12.330,01:32:43.740,spk_0,"Yes, well, it's only that you and I have done loads of these cases my colleagues have done well, possibly Lord Kerr may have done, but my colleagues have not. So it's important to know what it is we're talking about. We're not talking about not having heard from the child we're talking about not having heard directly from the child and not having given those representing the people who may feel affected by what the child has said a direct opportunity of cross examination. Yes, that's what"
01:32:44.270,01:32:53.050,spk_2,"the judge has happened already. Relied on the video in Paragraph 15(i) of her judgment as one of the reasons,"
01:32:53.060,01:33:44.760,spk_3,"yes, when a judge looks at the all the issues as to whether or not the child should give evidence or not, that's very much an aspect which the judge can consider. And indeed, in some cases, as it happens, not in this one. The judge may have expert evidence to guide him or her as to the potential liability of that recorded statement. And so there's additional evidence which can be taken to count, and one, one= additional point, if I may, on the ABE interview, which is relevant as your leadership has summarised it is, of course, done in that highly professional way, given the chance to child speak and not challenging the child. But therein is its own difficulty, which it is not a challenging account. And so, although except all the others have said and has to recall that it is, it is very much a free account with no challenge of any sort whatsoever."
01:33:45.350,01:34:16.930,spk_4,"I was going to ask that, I mean at the time. What, Firstly, what sort of time in advance of the trial? These video interviews recorded. And at that time will there in practise have been any knowledge of the likely response of people such as the step Father in this case and any opportunity for that likely response to be fed into the questioning"
01:34:16.930,01:35:42.260,spk_3,"in any way. The ethos is get it done as soon as possible. This child was video interviewed on the day that she made her complaint at school, and so that that is, that is the guidance to get it done as soon as possible. So it is captures the child, child's account as fresh as possible. And so firstly, there is no opportunity to at all to know how any person might respond to it, because it's the first caption of that evidence. And indeed, under the guidance of the ABE interview procedure for an interviewer to seek to challenge or to put another person's account would be regarded as wholly wrong. That is not the purpose, and the purpose is to have the child to give the account. And, My Lord, that that summary of how these things happen does impact come back into the point that my lady, My Lord Browne, we're making about the wider impact of these cases, that that's how they often start. And that is in my submission when one looks at it from that perspective, gives some reassurance that the anxiety which the court rightly raises with me is not likely to apply in practise because these interviews are almost inevitably led by the police. That's the starting point"
01:35:42.980,01:35:55.720,spk_5,"slightly oblique issue to that point. Is it open to the judge to prescribe High cross examination will be conducted if she decides that the child should give evidence"
01:35:59.610,01:36:03.600,spk_3,"I would expect to submit the answer to that must be overwhelmingly yes"
01:36:04.940,01:36:09.540,spk_5,"to the extent of requiring council to submit questions in advance."
01:36:11.060,01:37:07.090,spk_3,"Of course, the evidence based my answer to lordship's question is limited for obvious reasons, but where I personally have seen children give evidence and I've experienced of very learning disabled just passed children giving evidence 1921 but functioning at a much younger level and certainly in one case I have in mind in that regard, the judge made absolutely clear to council in advance that in cross examination she would take a pretty dim view of leading and would be likely to discount questions which were answers, which arose from leading questions. So council was, in a sense, free put the questions he or she chose. But knowing given the limitations of the witness, the judge would see them in a particular way. How far particular judges might go. I think it's difficult to"
01:37:07.090,01:37:25.550,spk_5,"say. But those are forensic issues. I was more concerned about the judge who I was anxious to ensure that the child was protected as far as possible. What measures could the judge take to ensure that the child was not oppressed during cross examination?"
01:37:25.550,01:38:15.690,spk_3,"During the cross examination of itself, I would anticipate that the judge would readily and immediately intervene if counsel were acting in a way which the judge regarded as oppressive. And there's there's there's greater facility to do this, when, of course, has a child in a live link, because the judge can get quite a lot across the council without a word being said. And I certainly have experience of that. If you've got everyone's either on the TV but this eye contact and gesture contact between counts and the judge that can do quite a lot to moderate. A cross examination, which needs a little moderating or judges I would submit would be entitled to take more direct steps to limit council the idea"
01:38:15.690,01:38:17.050,spk_2,"of questions"
01:38:17.050,01:39:12.210,spk_3,"in advance. Personally, I've certainly never encountered, and one can see that might give rise to further considerations. But in my commission there is there is plenty of opportunity for that to be done, and and I would suggest it's proper to bear in mind. I think I don't I didn't seem to make a comparison with criminal law because my criminal law experience in practises. Some dissed somewhat distant now. But I think one can fairly claim that advocates and family proceedings are accustomed to questioning witnesses who are very limited for a variety of reasons. Often parents who are very limited young adults are very limited. And so there is a body of experience which could be brought to bear in the task when it does happen, as it does already. As Mr Brannigan noted in the footnote to her document."
01:39:12.960,01:39:28.270,spk_2,"So just just coming back to the question of when the ABE interview was because I think that's quite important because the child made more than one complaint at school. But it set out very clearly in Paragraph 7 of Miss Branigan's skeleton identifies when"
01:39:29.170,01:39:51.410,spk_3,"there are now two interviews the 18th Mr Liebrecht correct me I got the wrong date the 18th of June 2009. Child made the complaint at school that she'd been saying things to friends and some parents for some time. But she said something to a teacher on the 18th of June and that ABE interview took place that day."
01:39:51.420,01:39:52.410,spk_4,"Then"
01:39:52.410,01:41:03.210,spk_3,"the chronology, which Miss Branigan extends is the account we have from this Miss Branigan. Is that when Charlotte, if I can call by that student and not her real name. When Charlotte was told the outcome of the Court of Appeal proceedings, which, of course, she was rightly took place, she on that day made further comments the social worker, which were then the subject of a further ABE interview on the 13th of January. And that chronology is a passing interest in illustrating My Lords Lord Saville and Mance's question earlier questions about these processes. The first interview was conducted by the police in the joint investigation, then looking at a crime. Social workers also present and taking part from their perspective. The second interview the police had indicated that they didn't wish to investigate, so that was considered by Judge Marshall, and she invited the local authorities, arrange what's called a single agency interview with just social services, Undertaking that interview. So we have an illustration, in fact, two different types of interview taking place in this case."
01:41:03.310,01:41:15.170,spk_2,"But I think that the content of the second interview was more concerned with allegations not only about Charlotte herself but also her mother and her half siblings."
01:41:15.600,01:41:16.650,spk_3,"Yes,"
01:41:16.680,01:41:18.440,spk_1,"it was physical abuse other than"
01:41:19.070,01:41:20.890,spk_3,"yes, yes,"
01:41:22.730,01:41:31.810,spk_1,"I just wonder, why wasn't there a ABE interview back in whatever it was June 09, when not during the 09, June 08, when the first allegation was met?"
01:41:32.590,01:41:50.240,spk_3,"Because I believe what happened is when the Charlotte said something at school when the police went into a police or social workers. But certainly when she was first spoken to, she immediately retracted what she had. What was, she was reported to have said. So there"
01:41:50.240,01:41:50.720,spk_4,"was"
01:41:51.350,01:42:00.160,spk_3,"the beginning of that. Chain of Events was a friend showing a text message, Charlotte then being spoken to and her not"
01:42:00.870,01:42:01.340,spk_1,"putting"
01:42:01.340,01:42:02.940,spk_3,"forward a complaint herself."
01:42:02.950,01:42:04.330,spk_1,"I"
01:42:04.340,01:42:37.980,spk_3,"speculated a small degree, but I would imagine in that situation the police felt well. If she's not saying anything, there's nothing for us to interview her about, in fact, because they saw her in school that day and she said, No, no, my friends went wrong. It's all a misunderstanding. And then the next day took a police state witness statement from her, where she disavowed that which has been said by her friends and then later was interviewed herself as a suspect for having wasted police time, where she admitted that she had, where she made a statement to the effect that she had lied."
01:42:38.650,01:42:46.500,spk_1,"It doesn't matter, but I think they're all muddling up to events. Because then there was another occasion when she said that the girl had misunderstood what she said."
01:42:47.480,01:42:50.280,spk_3,"There was a further such event or prior one. There were two"
01:42:51.230,01:43:53.040,spk_4,"just following up. Lord Curzon Point. Would there be anything to be said for a situation where not only where the general lines of, wished for examination disclosed to the judge in advance, but the judge actually put the questioning? I mean, I've seen procedures on the continent where it is standard for questioning to be done by the judge and very rare that anything remains, which, at the end, which counsel wish to ask separately. In Germany, they're certainly entitled to. But I'm not sure about other jurisdictions. I mean, is that certainly in France also, the judge does a lot of the questioning, is that is there anything to be said for that bearing in mind that an experienced judge would know, firstly indirect familiar to the witness, and secondly, it would know how to put the things unobtrusively?"
01:43:54.420,01:43:59.130,spk_3,"Well, My Lord, firstly, I personally have never come across that, and I would"
01:44:00.070,01:44:00.100,spk_0,"I"
01:44:00.220,01:45:11.240,spk_3,"anticipate that most of the family judges in front of whom I appear would be reluctant to step into the arena in that way. I may be wrong, but certainly in cases where I've heard children give evidence, that's not been the case, and I would be surprised if it were. But one part of the written presentation we've made to this course is the parallel, parallel view, not analysis, parallel view of criminal proceedings and the special measures that are available to children in criminal proceedings. And one of those measures is the use of intermediaries. Now I have no personal experience of that, but I understand that that does take place and that intermediaries are used within criminal proceedings. I can't speak with any authority about it, but as I understand it, you would have a person who has had specific training to assist in the questioning of a witness who was appointed by the court, I believe and would be fulfil some of those functions which My Lord raises, and there would be, in my submission, no reason in principle why that could not be available in a family case."
01:45:12.270,01:45:51.640,spk_0,"It's only because we think in traditional Common law adversarial process terms that we're not used to the idea that the court may act as an inquisitor. But of course, if we're thinking in terms of what Article 6 of the European Convention requires, we have to think how it would appear to a Continental Judge. And a Continental judge will probably be quite surprised to think that it wouldn't be the judge's responsibility to take the questioning further if there seemed to be things that had not been properly explored in the assuming there is an ABE interview and of course, there isn't always. But assuming that"
01:45:54.130,01:45:58.540,spk_3,"maybe yes. In principle, I I wouldn't say that."
01:45:58.540,01:46:12.310,spk_0,"There is a study of the intermediaries measure a preliminary study of the intervening years measure, which I can dig out for you, which is very encouraging."
01:46:12.320,01:46:34.110,spk_3,"Yes, well, anecdotally, I've heard good reports in relation to criminal proceedings, but I can't really urge that any further than that simple comment. My Lord, may I turn to make such submissions? I have in relation to"

01:46:35.890,01:46:41.380,spk_3,"matter is being put before this court now and the fact that the Family Justice Council are undertaking a task."
01:46:41.390,01:46:41.840,spk_2,"Yes,"
01:46:42.050,01:48:00.590,spk_3,"the report as to what to happen is extremely short that simply reflects the newness of it is a very short letter from the Family Justice Council, which simply says that Lord Justice Thorpe is setting up a multi multi disciplinary committee has proposed by Lord Justice, Wall and Wilson. And it has its first meeting on 16 March whose take part what the remit will be, we can't know. Other than that we have a number of questions asked by the Court of Appeal in this case. So the the issue seems especially to me to be, is how should this court today approach this Appellant's case in the light of the fact that that is to be going on? My Lords, can I, can I come at that question by looking at a short passage from the judgment of Lord Justice Wall in the Re S Re W case, which I have already referred briefly already? It's in, File 3. The first of the Authorities Bundle at tab 19, Paragraph 57."
01:48:07.370,01:48:07.690,spk_1,"Paragraph"
01:48:07.690,01:48:15.760,spk_3,"57, Lord Justice Wall. Ah, well, in that section of his judgment, he is"

01:48:17.000,01:49:17.730,spk_3,"54. He sets out his view. At that stage, the state of law was generally unsatisfactory. That's the end of Paragraph 54. Paragraph 55 is the Paragraph where he deals with the point about he never having had a child witness before him. Paragraph 57. Lord Justice Wall gives his views on the what has or hasn't happened under Pigott and in the middle of that Paragraph says this. If the law is to be changed and if children are either to be compelled to give oral evidence in court or to be excused from doing so, it must be for Parliament to make that change. With the great respect and deference to Lord Justice Wall I would respectfully submit that the proposition underlying that sentence is where we are already. We are already in a situation where judges have to decide whether children have to be compelled to give oral evidence or to excuse from doing so."
01:49:19.840,01:49:21.410,spk_2,"Sorry which..."
01:49:21.410,01:50:00.640,spk_3,"Paragraph 57. I hope I've taken to the right place. It's halfway down Paragraph 57. Bang in the middle of the Paragraph whether children are to be compelled to give evidence or to excuse from doing so is where we are. We have the hearsay order. Judges have to make that decision. And although I'm not accepted All that Lord Justice Wilson has previously said about the test, it will be recalled in Re P, he says that the application must be approached on its merits and without preconceptions. So judges are already tasked with precisely that. So there is."
01:50:01.440,01:50:01.720,spk_0,"We"
01:50:01.720,01:50:05.340,spk_3,"would submit nothing in that sense to go before Parliament."
01:50:05.450,01:50:10.310,spk_0,"Yes what would Parliament say? Parliament have already said here says Yes. Well,"
01:50:10.320,01:50:24.550,spk_3,"that's my submission entirely. It's classically the role of the courts to, as they have done, set out the way in which that power should be or power should be exercised."
01:50:24.560,01:50:43.990,spk_4,"Surely surely what you're really complaining of is the 3rd and 4th lines. No doubt the argument is that where the defendant's liberty is at stake, you must have the right to test the evidence by cross examination, irrespective of the harm that may be caused thereby. That may be true in criminal proceedings, but nobody suggests it's true here."
01:50:44.000,01:50:49.320,spk_3,"Quite so, Yeah, yes, so when"
01:50:49.320,01:51:05.020,spk_2,"when he says it, it's for Parliament to make the change he's talking about the criminal law is he? About criminal evidence. If he switched over to family law, it's not easy to see, at which point, precisely, he's done so."
01:51:08.950,01:51:13.260,spk_4,"Basically, you're accepting their discretion and saying that got slanted."

01:51:25.860,01:51:38.300,spk_3,"Yeah, yes. Well, then maybe I've maybe I had misapprehended what that was saying. But in any event, what I was seeking to do is to take to end of a possible spectrum"

01:51:39.970,01:53:09.190,spk_3,"raises particular point. Is this the right point in time? In the right venue? Do we need legislation or the other end of the spectrum? Is it a contribution from the family Justice Counsel? The family justice Counsel may provide background evidence. I don't see that dismissively at all. Background evidence against which these applications can be considered by judges and it may be very valuable background evidence. So when a judge has to consider a particular case, we would submit, the judge should have evidence particular to that child as to the likely effect upon that child. Evidence about all the other competing interests to be considered. And it may be very valuable for that judge to set that evidence in the context of whatever the family Justice Council is able to contribute and undoubtedly would be an extremely valuable contribution to the evidential evaluation that that judge must take My Lord looking on from today into the immediate future. Any cases that arise for decision before the family Justice Council reports, the courts will need to know what tests to apply and going beyond that In any cases that follow any report from the family justice Counsel, the courts will need to know what tests to apply."
01:53:10.020,01:53:10.280,spk_0,"Do"
01:53:10.280,01:53:14.300,spk_2,"we know whether they've been asked to report by a particular date?"
01:53:14.310,01:54:32.160,spk_3,"I don't know any more than it is. In that brief note, I came to my attention had been set up. Urgent that this talk from knows something about it by asking given as much information as I could at the time, and that letter is produced as a result of that inquiry. So I'm afraid I can't other than the 16th March, I can't assist at all, and that information is fresh as of I think about Thursday last week. I could overnight make inquiry as to whether the personality yet confirmed. But I was told at that stage that although people been invited, not all has yet accepted etcetera. So it's very it's very fresh. Therefore, in a nutshell, there is. I don't I don't suggest otherwise much that can be contributed to the evidential assessment that has been made. But none of that will or does avoid the need for the test to be considered. And if we're on this in this field, wrong in our submissions, then there is a test.

00:02:04.910,00:02:05.700,spk_0,"70."
00:02:07.690,00:05:05.710,spk_1,"The conclusion of that paragraph, that it will encourage their full cooperation within the criminal justice system, retaining the maximum opportunity to face to face confrontation with the child witness at trial. My Lord, having surveyed those comments, as before, I accept that that is -- that wider matter is a matter to which this Court should give attention, and considering these submissions, and I would respectfully submit that there's nothing which we have advanced which stands contrary to that either objective or safeguard, however one regards it, and having considered the way My Lords put it in that case, it does [inaudible] submit -- reflect the way, of course, that it will be approaching criminal cases, and there is nothing that could arise from this judgment, which would make the matter worse for children, I would submit. May I turn to say a word about the position of siblings. The siblings, in this case, obviously, but the question of siblings generally. I've touch upon these matters already to some extent, but slightly tangentially, and if I can therefore just deal with it for a moment as a separate heading, we would submit that the position of siblings, siblings who are the subjects of proceedings, presents an acutely difficult situation. It's not an unusual situation at all, that the older sibling, the older child, should be the one making the allegation, and there should be younger siblings whose position hangs in the balance. That was the case in R v B, and is the case here. It presents a number of difficulties, not least, we would submit, for guardians. And as it -- Ms Branigan seems to concede in the final paragraph of her documents, that it can present an acute difficulty for guardians where they have to consider the position both of the potential child witness and the other siblings. A guardian, for instance, may be satisfied that a child witness would suffer some important element of harm if giving evidence, but it may be that the welfare interests of the younger children has to be considered separately. It may be strongly in the interests of those younger children, that the allegations are tested robustly, and I don't want this submission to be more -- to sound more draconian than it is intended to be, but it may be that if the result of the testing is a finding that their oldest sibling was not reliable in the accusations, then those younger siblings family life may be saved, and it may, from their perspective, be a price worth paying, so there's a potential for a real tension between the interests of different"
00:05:05.710,00:05:18.060,spk_0,"siblings. Well, in an extreme case, you have different guardians, and the most extreme case I can think of was the conjoined twins, where the matter got to the Court of Appeal before it was realised that they needed separate guardians."
00:05:18.400,00:06:10.890,spk_1,"My Lord, yes. And obviously one always wants to have an eye to the practical effects of any proposition. Because this is a specific case management decision, it may well be that many judges and guardians, in many cases, would consider that a single guardian could make those representations. One would have to have very much an eye to that possibility. And so the simple submission we make is there needs to be an intense focus on the position of those younger siblings, and the position without a doubt is all the present authorities are silent on that subject, so if nothing else, under as it were the second global heading of our argument, it's something which needs, whatever the overall framework of the test, it's something which needs very clearly to be articulated, that there can be separate factors to be considered for younger siblings."
00:06:12.750,00:06:46.530,spk_3,"But of course, it's in everybody's best interests that all the evidence is properly deployed and properly tested. That's in everybody's best interests. Of course, the whole idea of achieving best evidence, is to achieve best evidence. The only question is whether, in order to achieve the best evidence, it's always necessary to have a face to face confrontation across a dramatic courtroom between a very tall man with a loud voice and rather little girl with a small voice. Oh, that's just a figurative"
00:06:46.530,00:06:48.400,spk_1,"example. The arrangements would, of course, be"
00:06:48.400,00:06:49.520,spk_3,"different."
00:06:49.550,00:07:14.850,spk_1,"And it may not be me cross examining. Exactly. My Lady, yes, yes, but, when the judge is considering the child -- the potential child witness, there is potential for harm to that child, and that has to be weighed very carefully. But that concern does not arise for the siblings."
00:07:18.690,00:07:42.500,spk_3,"Well, for the siblings, you have the two kinds of harm. One is that they're left in a dangerous situation. If the allegations against their parent are not believed, and the other is that they are in some way -- have their family life disrupted, and of course, that could be in lots of different ways, if the allegations are believed, so it's in both directions."
00:07:42.500,00:08:51.080,spk_1,"Yes, and they find themselves with the door swinging. My Lord, may I move on to address the particular facts of this case, which, unless the Court feels it necessary for me to do otherwise, I think I can deal with in relatively short compass, that the facts have been summarised in the [inaudible]. We've dealt with the facts of this case in our written argument, and it's dealt with some length by Lords Justices Wall and Wilson. So I don't -- as I say, unless the Court invites me to do otherwise, I don't propose to go through all those elements in any great detail, but making perhaps slightly more global submissions, we would suggest that it is a striking feature of this case, that Charlotte was willing to give evidence. And as the Court knows, it was the expectation of all, including herself, that she would do so until the judge proposed an alternative. And I don't make any criticism of the judge in that comment, that's simply the correct factual history. And it is another extremely important feature of this case,"
00:08:51.240,00:08:52.270,spk_4,"because"
00:08:52.270,00:10:18.510,spk_1,"of that history, when one can see how it arose, but because of that history, no reasons specific to her welfare were put forward as to why she should not give evidence. There was -- when the judge amended or proposed to amend the order which he had made in September, the local authority and the guardian then changed their positions, but the judge had not been presented and no stage was presented by specific assessment of the interests and the welfare interests of this child. And, we would submit, that it is essential, as I have made clear in a number of the other submissions made, that the cases -- any individual cases judged very much on the evidence of that case. And it does, we would submit, illustrate the presumptive element of the test at the moment, that it was thought possible to put a case before the court leading to a decision the child didn't give evidence, without any evidence particularised to that child, and that does reveal a deficit in the case as presented factually. The arguments which we have presented in favour of the child giving evidence are summarised by Lords Justices Wall and Wilson in the judgment in this case at, paragraph 16, that's file 1, tab 3(a), I"
00:10:18.520,00:10:20.400,spk_0,"believe. Yeah, file"
00:10:20.400,00:11:17.990,spk_1,"1, tab 3(a), paragraph 16, and the lettered subparagraphs A to K do encapsulate matters which we put forward, and upon which we certainly do rely, but absent from that list, and I do reaffirm, it's the point that no evidence particular to the harm that will be suffered by this child was before the Learned Judge. And that is an important absence from that list A to K, so I would invite the court to, as it were, add that point to that list. And arising from those considerations, there were, we submit, very strong reasons as to why, on that particular facts of this particular case, it was necessary that she should give evidence. There's absolutely no dispute between the parties, but that her account is central to the"
00:11:17.990,00:11:18.760,spk_3,"case."
00:11:20.380,00:13:06.080,spk_1,"The scientific evidence is an important component of the case, and is clearly, as part of the forensic analysis, capable of supporting her account, but it is not independent of it. And if her reliability is considered by a judge to be significantly dented, the scientific evidence cannot stand alone to make out the case, and therefore one comes back to the importance of her account. And in the absence of oral evidence, the reality of a case such as this, is that without oral evidence, and subject to the one issue of questions in relation to the scientific evidence, challenging the case amounts effectively to a paper review. And we submit that a paper review, of a matter of such importance, is not a sufficient investigation, and particularly where of course, as the Court knows this, that Charlotte has in the past, one way or another lied to figures of authority about allegations. And of course, in the way that I've already just summarised, the decision on her allegations is central to the welfare decision about the younger siblings, and that increases the focus on the need for the Court to have the most in depth inquiry. So, My Lord, I rely upon the matters as set out by Lord Justice Wilson and as added to by me, in the way that we've articulated in the written case, and I don't propose to go over those matters, but we say, that on those facts and on the test, as we submit to this Court"
00:13:06.080,00:13:06.470,spk_4,"that"
00:13:07.040,00:13:43.920,spk_1,"there should be on an equal starting, one can properly conclude that Charlotte should give evidence in this case. Having said that, I accept that if this Court would consider that in the light of the appropriate test further evidence were needed before that decision as to whether or not she should give evidence was made, then this Court might take the view that that was a first instance decision which should be made. And so, if I may respectfully do so, my submission is, if you take the facts as are,"
00:13:44.430,00:13:44.710,spk_2,"then"
00:13:44.710,00:13:58.120,spk_1,"that would lead to the decision that the child should give evidence. If the Court having -- if the Court is minded to reconsider the test, and having framed it, considers that further evidence would be required, it may well be that that would be a first instance decision. [Pause]."
00:14:05.690,00:14:24.690,spk_2,"Mr Gee, can you help, I mean, what happens to [inaudible] in the UK? I mean, assume that she doesn't give evidence, assume that for that reason, well, I say for that reason, assume that that having been position, the judge says, Well, I'm not sure on the balance of probabilities. Does the criminal case go ahead?"
00:14:28.050,00:14:28.480,spk_4,"The"
00:14:28.480,00:14:45.970,spk_1,"formal answer to that, of course, is whether the criminal case goes ahead is a matter for the CPS -- of course -- as Your Lordship knows. But one does know from experience that decisions in family cases can impact upon decisions as to criminal cases, but not necessarily at all."
00:14:45.980,00:15:00.170,spk_2,"There's a case I picked up from the page called Levi, where, apparently there was someone who was convicted of manslaughter, and that was upheld despite the trial judge and the care proceedings not having been satisfied, or something."
00:15:00.180,00:15:31.830,spk_1,"Yes, Mr Justice Hedley was not able to come to a conclusion as to who was responsible for the death of the child, I think it was a death. The Crown decided nonetheless to press the criminal case, which led to the conviction of Levi, as a pretrial endeavour, the defence team in the Crown Court had argued that it was wrong for the Crown to proceed when the family division judge had made such a decision."
00:15:31.840,00:15:34.490,spk_2,"Right, no child evidence involved in that case."
00:15:35.110,00:15:35.670,spk_1,"No."
00:15:36.240,00:15:37.790,spk_2,"No, but I mean, the same idea."
00:15:37.950,00:15:38.720,spk_1,"Yes."
00:15:38.730,00:15:42.910,spk_2,"So the care judge unsatisfied, but the prosecution went ahead."
00:15:43.290,00:15:53.690,spk_1,"I think many would say that's a rarity to come across that situation, which is why it's up in lights as a reported case and that one --"
00:15:53.700,00:16:05.710,spk_2,"if it's a rarity, I mean, does it follow that if care proceedings -- the allegation is not sustained because the child hasn't given -- hasn't"
00:16:06.550,00:16:07.020,spk_4,"been"
00:16:07.020,00:16:15.140,spk_2,"cross examined or whatever it may be, the child therefore never gets to give evidence, because the criminal proceedings fail."
00:16:15.450,00:18:06.560,spk_1,"Well, turning more directly to the issue of the interplay of the criminal family proceedings and the way Ms Branigan has raised it in her argument, in the way Your Lordship is positing it, it can very much cut both ways, and it's very difficult now to predict how matters might turn out in any future case, depending upon the decision of the judge in the care proceedings. One certainly can't say that if children give evidence more often in family cases, it's going to mean they have to give evidence twice because, these are generalities, of course, but one comes across cases where the family judge is not satisfied as to the case, relevant papers are sent to the Crown, they consider those papers ,and take the view, in the light of that, that it's not a prosecution that merits being pursued according to their own guidance. And so, as a result of the child giving evidence in the family case, there is no criminal case. The converse can apply, if the child gives evidence patently, competently and well, and the judge makes findings, then the criminal defence team are going to need to attend to that with enormous care, knowing the consequences for a plea or not in such a case, and the fact that the child has once stood up to cross examination, and one can foresee there may be cases where pleas of guilty might follow. Now this is conjecture, but it's conjecture simply put forward, to rebut the suggestion that if the outcome, which is not necessarily so, if the outcome here is that more children give evidence, then it will end up children giving evidence twice, not necessarily so at all. It could --"
00:18:06.760,00:18:25.050,spk_2,"I was really looking at the other side of the coin, the child not giving evidence at this stage. If the allegation is then found not sustained on the balance of probabilities, it may result in there being no prosecution, so the child doesn't give evidence, not really doesn't give it twice, doesn't give it once."
00:18:25.060,00:20:10.460,spk_1,"Yes, I respectfully agree, and in cases where, for whatever reason, whether a judicial decision or simply the way matters fall out, if the criminal case comes first, then that may well spare the child, if there's a conviction that will -- it is highly likely to seal the issue, in family cases often there are far more wide ranging considerations, but it would deal with the heart of it. Having said that, to be even handed about it, the child may give evidence to a jury, applying the burden standard proof, the defendant may be acquitted, and then the question arises whether the child might then need to give evidence before the family judge, or whether the transcripts might suffice. So all one can say, having run around those possibilities, is it's probably not appropriate to try and set the appropriate test now, by any prediction as to how it's likely to affect the interplay between crime and family. There are so many uncertainties and it's the science of human frailty that's likely to predict that rather than thing else. [Pause]. My Lord, drawing my submissions to this Court to a conclusion in just a few words, the -- judged by the documents that have been submitted, I anticipate that the submissions that this court is about to receive, are that -- to the effect that there is a consistent line of sound authority, which properly sets the test that is to be applied in these types of cases. We would respectfully submit, that before this Court, is a series of"
00:20:10.470,00:20:11.250,spk_0,"cases"
00:20:11.260,00:20:42.950,spk_1,"which demonstrate a rising scale of unease and dissatisfaction as to the way the law is presently set. Even if one goes back to Lord Justice Nichols in The Crown v B, one has there, as fully set out in that case and in Lord Justice Rimer's judgment, and in our submissions, grave anxieties about the process which was being embarked upon in that particular case, and which has come to set the trend for so many"
00:20:42.950,00:20:43.610,spk_4,"others."
00:20:44.430,00:21:29.640,spk_1,"So at the very beginning of the process, one has those articulated anxieties. More recently, one has the anxieties expressed by Mr Justice Coleridge in the Torbay case, and one has the unease expressed by Lord Justice Wall in the re S, re W case. And then one comes to the Court of Appeal decision in this case, where all three judges of the Court of Appeal, expressed considerable unease and anxiety about the state of the law, albeit from different perspectives. Lord Justice Wall and Wilson directly expressed their unease, Justice Rimer goes considerably further raising his concern of risk of miscarriage of"
00:21:29.640,00:21:30.320,spk_4,"justice."
00:21:31.750,00:22:10.610,spk_1,"That, My Lords, we suggest, does show a rising scale of unease and dissatisfaction. The origins for that are traceable, and I hope we have done something to be able to trace them, and the conflict with re S, we submit, is clear. And it's in those circumstances that we invite the Court to revisit the way in which these cases are decided. And so doing, is in our submission, that that is to say nothing for how an individual case may fall out, and it is not a plea for more children to have to give evidence. My Lord, unless I can assist the Court any further, those are my submissions."
00:22:10.620,00:22:12.130,spk_0,"Thank you very much, Mr Gee."
00:22:12.460,00:22:40.690,spk_3,"Could I please ask you to dictate to us the test as you would like it to be? Because I've been looking through your printed case and I don't actually find -- I find some very cogent criticisms of the present state of the law, but I'm not sure -- other than pointing as to paragraph 17 of re S, you have actually told us what you think the law should be. Would you like time to think about that?"
00:22:40.710,00:24:57.600,spk_1,"My Lady, Mr Liebrecht and I have done a lot of thinking about it, and I didn't want to be presumptuous in any dictation, but I can certainly tell Your Ladyship how -- the factors that we would see comprising the appropriate test. The first, because one would be -- having to put it in the context of what has gone to date, the first statement would be a clear statement of an equal starting point for all competing interests. Sorry, could you say that again? An equal starting point for all competing interests and the -- of course, one can't begin to list all competing interests that might arise, but judges can be cautioned or advised to be alert to the Article 6 and 8 rights of witnesses, and in the way that My Lady, we've canvassed already, that would apply to different -- witnesses in the three different positions before the Court. The Article 6 and 8 rights of parents, and the Article 6 and 8 rights of siblings. And if one sets those as separate categories as the appropriate path to begin thinking about, that at least gives a decision-making judge in an individual case the right ambit of decisions to consider. The present authorities rely significantly upon the, as Lord Justice Wilson put it, the yardstick of oppression, we've traced through the origins of oppression as a test in issuing a witness summons, just -- I haven't gone through it in detail, but it goes back to the ITN case and Morgan v Morgan within family proceedings, and we've done that simply because, this Court may wish to consider whether or not oppression is too clumsy a test. It may be that when one is looking at the welfare of the child, things short of oppression should be taken into account. So, there is -- certainly there's no, we would submit, there's no binding authority on this Court that says oppression must stay in, and the Court may wish or need to consider whether a more flexible test in looking at the child's welfare might be appropriate."

And, My Lords, if one goes through Subsection 2(a) to (i), they do illustrate if one has this case or any other similar case in mind, how thoroughly one can test the advantages and disadvantages of the hearsay evidence. A, how much probative value the statement has --"
00:26:32.030,00:26:42.590,spk_3,"Have we got the equivalent in civil proceedings? Hearsay evidence has been admissible in civil proceedings, since the, I think, 1995 Act."

I mean the interview on, isn't -- nobody's questioning that, the only question is whether it should be subject to cross examination. And not all these bits and pieces under Subsection 2 apply, but it does throw some light on the sort of considerations you should be having, and that's really your point."
00:27:56.480,00:28:03.710,spk_1,"My Lord, yes, and I should have -- I rushed into Section 114 too quickly. I should have prefaced it by recognising, of course, that that is a test of admissibility and we're not in that"

What's obviously missing from Section 114, because it has no part in its function, is the welfare of the child, and so one would plainly have to have, at the forefront of any judge's consideration, the question of the welfare of the child, alongside all the other considerations. Well,"
00:28:39.290,00:28:45.200,spk_2,"I suppose the welfare of the child conceivably comes into Subsection 2(g) --"

00:28:56.640,00:29:27.850,spk_1,"No, but it's only insofar as it's a helpful guide, I say no more than that. But the key point which follows from that, which is the substance of the submission we make, is that the assessment made must be particular to the case in hand. And I went to 114, no more -- for no purpose, really, other than to say that's one way of looking at the -- that assessments. You look at the assessments particular to the case, and generalised propositions are unlikely to be sufficient."

00:29:33.990,00:31:05.190,spk_1,"Yes, yes, it's all within that framework, precisely. I mean, I began by saying the test have a clear statement of an equal starting point, and that's obviously a distillation from that, and then of course, insofar as any alleviation measures can be taken, they should be taken. There's no reason that -- where children do give evidence in family proceedings it is done by video link and matters of that sort. And then, of course, any test would have to set out clearly the caution which would be necessary if the hearsay evidence is received by the Court, untested by cross examination, and that is found to be expressed in the authorities but perhaps not in the way that it should be. It's most articulately expressed, most urgently expressed by Lord Justice Nichols in The Crown v B. And then, My Lady, in all that I've just said there is, we would submit, nothing, which creates a presumption in the opposite direction, but it would provide, we submit,  a clear and open way in which a judge could be assisted in coming to the right decision on what are always going to be extremely difficult"

Because an ABE interview can't really be seen as being simply analogous with a written statement. If you have a written statement, you come to court, give evidence in chief, you're cross examined on it. The point about the ABE interview is that it's designed specifically to be the way"
00:35:43.850,00:35:44.540,spk_1,"of"
00:35:44.840,00:38:13.390,spk_4,"achieving the best evidence that you can get, or are likely to get from children. And there's a process whereby, the child makes a disclosure, somebody makes a referral to social services or the police, very often it's to the school, they make notes on the back of an envelope, it goes to the head mistress, she contacts -- or it's made to a parent who goes to the police. So there's a process before it gets to the police and social services. They then initiate something called a Section 47 inquiry, before they do an ABE interview, usually the child is visited for what is called a vulnerable witness assessment, which frequently involves asking the child general questions, and very often seeing whether or not the child discloses anything in the course of that, at which point they close it down and then set up an ABE interview. And the ABE interview is designed to contain no leading questions at all, if at all possible, because as I think it was the Cleveland report, we apologise, My Lords, for not having a copy of that here, but was very clear that the process of questioning children was supposed to be open-ended, it was supposed to encourage free recall, free discussion, free exposition from the child with open-ended non-leading questions, then designed to elicit detail and as much as the child could remember. So it's quite different in many respects from, say, just a written statement or a statement to the police or something like a no comment interview to the police, in criminal proceedings. There was also a recognition in Cleveland that the more you question a child, the less likely you are to get the truth. But if you keep questioning a child about something, it's more likely to come up with something that previously hadn't arisen. So the general rule is that you only do one ABE interview, and you only do another one if there's a very good reason for it. But you certainly don't go beyond two. So the whole process is not simply a question of taking a statement"
00:38:13.390,00:38:14.240,spk_2,"from a child,"
00:38:14.250,00:38:39.430,spk_4,"but is actually designed to elicit the best evidence that you can from a child. And therefore it isn't perhaps as obvious in relation to children, as it is in relation to adults, that you have statement cross examination to test it. It's a little more -- the ABE interview is designed to be in more depth than that in the first place."
00:38:40.940,00:38:54.260,spk_3,"It's also a more free flowing thing, isn't it? Oh, yes. So, all sorts of stuff comes along, which enables you to see how the child is behaving and reacting to the whole situation. Yes, yes,"
00:38:54.260,00:38:55.080,spk_4,"indeed. And of course,"
00:38:55.080,00:38:58.860,spk_3,"it's in normal surrounding, or nearly normal surroundings as well. Yes,"

00:39:02.240,00:39:03.550,spk_3,"Well, normal is putting out a bit high, but --"
00:39:03.560,00:39:12.680,spk_4,"Yes. The child will be encouraged to give their own account, and then they will go back over it and ask for more details on the specific bits of it. You've"
00:39:12.680,00:39:13.340,spk_3,"managed to turn"
00:39:13.340,00:39:15.290,spk_4,"your microphone -- oh sorry, I'm afraid the button--"

00:39:16.820,00:39:51.130,spk_4,"Yes, all you have to do is [inaudible] buttons. So the interviewer is then supposed to try and elicit more detail on particular items of the child's story. And of course, is strictly enjoined not to ask leading questions, not to make suggestions to the child, which, of course, is exactly what would happen in cross examination, is you would be putting things to a child, on the basis that children may well be more susceptible to pressure and suggestions. The"
00:39:51.130,00:40:08.420,spk_5,"other side of the coin is that because it's designed to get in at the very first possible moment, it is designed to take place in a situation where there's in fact no possibility of knowing background from anyone else's viewpoint."
00:40:09.000,00:42:25.460,spk_4,"Indeed, indeed, it doesn't always work perfectly, as was the case in this case in 2008. But that is the good practice is to get in quickly. And the general approach in care proceedings, when the accusee, the person against the allegations are made, seeks to challenge the ABE, there are a number of ways in which [inaudible] challenged that don't amount to wishing to call the child to give evidence. And one of those is to get an expert to look at the quality of the ABE interview, not a veracity expert, as they're sometimes called, but somebody to say, Well, yes, good practice was followed, or, no good practice wasn't followed, but only in this respect, that kind of approach. Another thing that is frequently done, is to call and cross examine all those involved in the initial allegation and the initial referral. So where a child has said things to friends, said things to their mother or grandmother, then a social worker has come in, and then the police have conducted a vulnerable witness assessment, all those people are called and challenged as to what they said, very often with a view to establishing whether or not they in fact asked leading or suggestible questions to the child and therefore have in effect contaminated the ABE interview before you even reach the interview. And that's a very common feature of care proceedings, which is another reason why it's very important for the ABE interview to be done at the outset. Frequently also in care proceedings, you get further disclosures from the child to the foster carer at a later stage. And of course, that can all be challenged. So that is the if I can say, that is the normal process of care proceedings. So it isn't quite as bold, it isn't usually bold as saying, Well, there's a statement, and it should be challenged. It's a process that has been designed, as I said, to elicit the best of what children can give by way of evidence, in a way that's appropriate to children. We"

But as far as I'm aware, it doesn't go over again the earlier matters, because that would not be in accordance with the achieving best evidence practice, its purpose is simply to illicit what the child has to say about the further allegations that she has made of physical abuse in relation to herself and the rest of the family."

00:46:01.480,00:47:10.930,spk_4,"interviews and their purpose and nature, which leads, My Lord, onto the second point that, briefly looking at the history, it was the point I made in my written case statement. The reason why there are no special measures in care proceedings as there are in criminal proceedings, is because there haven't had to be, because of the fact that in wardship proceedings and in children's proceedings until H v K, and then subsequently after the changing of the law, hearsay evidence has been acceptable, and it is rare for children to be called. So all the lengthy and extensive consideration that went into the matter, to resolve matters within the criminal jurisdiction simply wasn't necessary because it didn't arise."
00:47:11.550,00:47:11.970,spk_1,"As"
00:47:11.970,00:47:18.160,spk_4,"a matter of practice in care proceedings, if it is possible, on the rare occasions when a child is"
00:47:18.160,00:47:19.220,spk_2,"called,"
00:47:19.230,00:48:10.920,spk_4,"usually the court will make an arrangement to borrow a criminal court that has the right facilities so they can give evidence by video link. But that relies on being in the right kind of court centre where you have those facilities which, of course, many of them don't. But it is very rare that a child is called. So there hasn't been no consideration of special measures in civil proceedings, because nobody turned their mind to it. It simply hasn't been necessary because the matter is approached from an entirely different angle. In criminal proceedings, there is an assumption that the child will give evidence and will be cross-examined, whereas in care proceedings there is an assumption, that we say is a right assumption, that the child will not. So it simply hasn't arisen until now."
00:48:11.100,00:48:16.780,spk_5,"That is really the point in issue in this case, isn't it? I mean you put your finger"

00:48:18.490,00:49:05.530,spk_5,"insofar as I am able to detect any ratio decidendi in the Court of Appeal cases, it seems to have emerged from a comment by Dame Janet -- Lady Justice Janet Smith, and been taken up in the fourth case W, and then applied in this, and it just seems to me to that effect, that there is -- it's very rare that you call a child to give oral evidence and the discretion is almost always, if not always, exercised against it, full stop. And that's all I can detect, because there's a lot of talk about how important the discretion is, but ultimately, that's what the statement of principle is. And it's the statement of principle which the judge applied at the first instance in this case, on the last page of her judgment."
00:49:05.540,00:49:26.310,spk_4,"Yes, and that is a principle, it's not a -- the point I was simply making, it isn't an oversight, it's a specific statement of principle, one that on behalf of the local authority, we say is a correct statement of principle, and my learned friend says, effectively, is not."

00:49:52.830,00:50:04.570,spk_4,"I'm not aware of any statistics, My Lord, and our research is, we haven't come across any. Certainly it would be a very good idea if some research were done into this. I --"

00:50:09.990,00:51:02.130,spk_4,"I would say quite frequently when you're doing care cases, with very young children, there is often a great reluctance on the part of the CPS, or indeed anybody else to consider the prospect of them giving evidence. Very often it depends on how much forensic evidence there is in support. If there is a lot of forensic evidence, then that's a very different matter. In relation to how they fit with care proceedings, as a general rule, the care proceedings come first. If the child simply doesn't give evidence in care proceedings and the judge says he can't find something proved, as the child hasn't given evidence that may have no effect at all on the CPS decision to proceed with criminal proceedings where, of course, the child will be giving evidence. If a child gives evidence --"

So each case really depends very much on its facts. But the cases I'm aware of, where children, for one reason or another, have been called to give evidence have been very much at the upper end of the age scale. And that has usually been the case, that the police have been most anxious to know what evidence has been given, to see whether or not it affects their criminal proceedings. But normally, when a child doesn't give evidence, whatever is decided in the care proceedings is unlikely to affect their decision one way or the other,"

There's an underlying assumption in learned friend's submissions, that the criminal process is the more modern and the more up to date, and that the family is lagging behind. It may in fact be the other way around. But the criminal process has arisen because the necessity for fair trial, for natural justice, to be able to confront your accuser, to be able to ask questions, is so essential to the criminal process. But of course, in the family process, the focus of the issue is not is this person guilty or not, have the prosecution proved their case? It may well seem like that, at times, from the point of view of the person against whom the allegations are made, but in reality, that is not the focus of the case. The focus of the case is the welfare of the child. And the essence of the local authority submission is, to put it in one sentence, it doesn't really make any sense to set up an entire process designed to protect children, and then for that process to then be used to further traumatise them at the incidence of the potential abuser. Because, if the situation were, that as a matter of course, children who make these allegations would be called to give evidence to be cross-examined in care proceedings, it is entirely understandable that an innocent man, would wish the child to give evidence in the hope that they would then tell the truth. But it is also highly likely that every guilty person on the receiving end of these allegations, would also be very anxious for that child to give evidence, in the hope that the pressures would cause the child to retract before they ever gave evidence or cause the child to break down in the course of cross-examination.

Dealing further with the practicalities, if one then goes on to consider the situation that that puts the local authority in, in one respect it would be easy for local authority to say, particularly in a case like this, where you have a bright and articulate child, it would be easy for the local authority to say, Well, we'll call her, she's bright, she's articulate, that'll be fine, rather than thinking in terms of what is the potential for psychological harm and future psychological harm for this child, and to take a parental decision, effectively, in the exercise of their parental responsibility, that is not appropriate to call her. If in a substantial number of cases they were faced with the likelihood that on a level playing field argument, an argument where Article 6 took a very strong part, that a lot more children were going to be called to give evidence, the local authority would always then be in a position of having to weigh"

Because there are some cases where they don't need the child's evidence, where they can say, Well, right, in that case, we don't agree to the child being called, so we won't rely on any of that evidence, we've got other evidence that doesn't require the child to be called. But there are many cases where they can't do that. And one can only imagine the situation, for example, where you have a, say a teenage child, with no siblings, who, they are quite confident, does not want to give evidence or would not be happy giving evidence. If there is a decision that she should give evidence, the local authority thinking, Well, she's probably not going to go home anyway, so it's not worth putting her through the trauma of giving evidence, so we won't proceed with the proceedings because she'll remain in voluntary care. Where, however, there are younger siblings, who need to be protected, it would be very difficult for local authority in those circumstances, or for the child herself, not to feel under pressure to give evidence, even if it would be damaging, even if it be very upsetting or traumatic for her, not to feel, I have to make myself do this, or for the local authority not too subtly encourage her to do it, because of the need to protect the younger siblings. It's a minefield, in terms of child care and balancing the interests of an older child and younger children, and balancing the interests of potential psychological harm to children."

It just seems to me that it's so important to get the decision right in the care proceedings, much more important, actually, than it is to get it right and in any subsequent criminal proceedings. If a child is going to be giving evidence once, well, then it ought to be in the care proceeding and not in the other. If the child gives evidence in the care proceedings and there's --"

Criminal proceedings either drop or must depend on other evidence. But I mean it's -- because it's just a question of how much more likely it is you're going to get the right result. If you do have the child cross-examined, that seems to me to be almost the all important consideration, because I mean, if you're going to get decisions right that otherwise you're going to get wrong, then it's worth paying a price, because, you know, you're going to protect sometimes that child, often, as you say, the youngest siblings and the rest of it. I mean, that's what really matters, to get it right. And if the child is making false allegations, it's equally important that that is right too, so that the younger siblings, etcetera, don't lose out in life. I mean, we have no notion that's -- I mean a lot of people, particularly with non family background, your sort of Lord Justice Nichols and Lord Justice Rimer and so forth, and perhaps even I, myself, feel, because we're brought up against tradition that basically, cross-examination is a good idea, you know, it helps get out the truth."
01:20:36.740,01:21:17.990,spk_4,"My Lord, absolutely, and there is a basic cultural disparity between the family law world and the criminal world, where the criminal law world, effectively, insofar as it has to, sacrifices the interests of children in order to get the result right. Whereas in the family world, the interests of the child is what it's all about, and therefore you don't sacrifice anything, as far as Children are concerned, you don't -- you're pursuing the interests of the children. So yes, My Lord, you have to get the answer right if at all possible, but not by traumatising children along the way. And this --"
01:21:18.580,01:21:51.210,spk_5,"Well this assumes that questioning -- is traumatising, yes -- well, no, it doesn't. It assumes that it has no purpose, I mean, you haven't fed that into the equation at all. Admittedly, I did notice there was a reference to the value in assessing, you judge the demeanour of the witnesses, I personally have always found that an extremely suspect notion, there being some very plausible liars, at least in the adult world, which I am familiar with."
01:21:52.790,01:21:53.520,spk_2,"[Laughter, inaudible]."
01:21:54.710,01:22:03.110,spk_3,"Yes [inaudible]. We are battling for principle, in an evidence free"
01:22:03.110,01:22:04.250,spk_4,"world,"
01:22:05.040,01:22:41.340,spk_3,"in the sense that we don't know what the impact of giving evidence in the very different atmosphere of family proceedings Court is on children, because they don't, on the whole, do it. The other thing, actually, we do have a little bit more evidence about, is how you get the best evidence out of children, because that's what achieving best evidence is all about. And it is based on a certain amount of psychological research about the reliability of what children"
01:22:41.340,01:22:42.360,spk_4,"say. Yes"
01:22:43.190,01:23:28.150,spk_3,"To a much greater extent than the assumption that cross-examination is the way to the truth. Now I'm not denying that cross-examination is the way to the truth in many, many cases. But one of the concerns is that a typical Old Bailey-style cross-examination is as likely to obscure the truth as it is to allow it to emerge. This is part of this is why I say we are trying to search for principle without actually having the empirical data on which to apply it. We want the best evidence, we want to get the answer right, no family judge is sitting there wanting to get it wrong. You're always doing the best you can. How do you do your best?"
01:23:29.220,01:23:31.460,spk_4,"My Lady, there is also the issue"
01:23:31.470,01:23:32.370,spk_3,"of"
01:23:33.630,01:23:43.480,spk_4,"the developmental stages that children go through in how they think. That is something that not even all the experts would agree where to draw the lines. You're going"
01:23:43.480,01:23:49.020,spk_3,"to have to speak up because even I'm having difficulty hearing you. No, it's not that, you just have to speak up."
01:23:50.510,01:24:26.500,spk_4,"The people who propose various levels of developmental stages, don't all agree on how they work. But the traditional Old Bailey cross-examination, that is designed to catch out even a hardened liar, may have a completely opposite effect on a child who may be at a stage of development and understanding where they're highly suggestible. So if a large man with an authoritative voice, tells you that this is so, and that's so, they say, Yes. And it may not be at all, of course, because -- [Inaudible]"
01:24:26.500,01:24:36.480,spk_2,"I mean you certainly don't want an Old Bailey-style cross-examination [inaudible], I mean, Old Bailey cross-examinations are designed to mislead the jury, I mean that's their very purpose."
01:24:36.540,01:24:41.660,spk_3,"I'm so glad that My Lord has said it, I was trying to avoid saying it."
01:24:41.670,01:25:31.950,spk_2,"No, no and I do recognise that in a sense, in the criminal context, actually, the reason why you have to allow a cross-examination and confrontation, all the rest of it, is not actually to get at the truth, it's in order to give the accused the feeling that he's had a fair trial and a fair opportunity. Yes. I mean, and that is regarded in a criminal context, I think, as perhaps more important than getting at the truth. I mean, I don't think Strasburg were in the least bit interested in a proposition, Well, actually you're going to get more reliable evidence by not cross-examining. I don't think they'd buy that, whereas in a -- I certainly in a care context, you know, if I was persuaded that you are more likely to get the accurate result without, well then, of course, I would be very susceptible to all that sort of"
01:25:31.950,01:25:33.380,spk_4,"argument. Yes."
01:25:33.500,01:26:00.770,spk_2,"I mean it's fair to say, I haven't looked back at our old friend Camberwell Green, or whatever at all, but actually, I mean, there is something in that too about getting the best -- and there's a sort of, you know, there's a provision in the legislation, you know, for doing something you couldn't otherwise do if it's going to obstruct your getting the fair, best result, or something -- I can't remember [inaudible] perhaps look at it overnight, because I don't want to take you off course."
01:26:00.870,01:26:07.550,spk_4,"Well, My Lord, it's the highlighted in My Lord's judgment at paragraph 70."
01:26:07.850,01:26:14.500,spk_2,"70 of what? Camberwell Green. Oh, well, no but that's a different point."
01:26:14.510,01:26:15.270,spk_4,"Oh, right."
01:26:23.220,01:26:23.290,spk_2,"No,"
01:26:23.400,01:26:24.350,spk_4,"maybe that was"
01:26:24.350,01:26:24.930,spk_0,"a different point, yes."
01:26:32.640,01:26:37.470,spk_2,"And there is -- there was some statutory provision, I've just seen some reference to it, it's"

01:26:39.180,01:26:50.240,spk_2,"some situations, whether it might tend to inhibit such evidence being effectively tested was one statutory provision, 19(3)(b), how it fits into the scheme, I can't for the life of me remember. But,"

01:26:51.550,01:26:53.250,spk_2,"mean, there is something about that."

01:27:41.520,01:28:00.550,spk_2,"19(3)(b). Yes, but doesn't anybody [inaudible] other people might have referred to it, I mean, I was only -- I'm looking at paragraph 22"

01:28:02.050,01:28:06.870,spk_2,"and then there's a Subsection 4 of Section,"
01:28:08.460,01:28:08.690,spk_4,"I suppose,"
01:28:08.700,01:28:27.820,spk_2,"21, is it? The rule does not apply to the extent the Court's is satisfied that compliance with it would not be likely to maximise the quality of the witness' evidence so far as practical. So [inaudible]"
01:28:28.480,01:28:29.890,spk_4,"it's not very clear, is it?"
01:28:29.900,01:28:34.010,spk_2,"[Inaudible] paragraph 65, I've got a parenthesis, it"
01:28:36.270,01:28:36.870,spk_4,"deals"
01:28:36.870,01:28:39.220,spk_2,"with some aspect of it, but I can't for the life of me remember what."

01:28:42.940,01:28:54.270,spk_2,"that special provisions about how something might tend to inhibit such evidence being effectively tested. So there it was, I mean, that was a concept introduced into that statutory scheme."
01:29:01.770,01:29:06.370,spk_3,"It's interesting that I record at paragraph 38,"
01:29:07.180,01:29:07.380,spk_4,"that"
01:29:07.390,01:29:21.220,spk_3,"council for one of the appellant's in the Camberwell case acknowledges that a video recorded interview is likely to be the best evidence that a child can give, for the reasons that I then record. Yes."
01:29:32.520,01:29:37.930,spk_4,"Yes, My Lady, which really comes back to my point that an ABE interview is not really the equivalent of a statement of an adult."
01:29:38.940,01:30:35.170,spk_5,"It slightly depends what you mean by best evidence. I mean, if one entertains the hypothesis, which I suppose one must entertain that sometimes, some such allegations might be fabricated, then it may be the best evidence in a different sense, and it may be that if questioned against the background, it might be retracted or might prove to be untenable. I suppose that's the sort of possibility one's got to entertain, when it is flatly deny that there was any abuse, and I mean in this case, as a matter of interest, as I understand it, she was asked in her first ABE interview why she had made previous allegations which she'd retracted. Yes, and she explained, yeah. That was a complete discussion of that theme, was it, so one could say that's been dealt with thoroughly."
01:30:35.320,01:30:40.230,spk_4,"She explains why she retracted, yes. I think she was 11 at the time."
01:30:40.550,01:31:11.880,spk_5,"I mean, I noticed in paragraph 26 of your case that you said the strength of the forensic evidence, coupled with the medical evidence, those are factors in favour of her account, and the history of these previous allegations and retractions is such that it's not necessary or appropriate for her to be drawn directly into the forensic arena, i.e. what, that they're sufficient to enable the court to decide between two apparently conflicting cases?"
01:31:13.140,01:31:13.270,spk_3,"Well,"
01:31:13.270,01:31:16.280,spk_4,"My Lord, care --"
01:31:17.270,01:31:18.780,spk_3,"a care"
01:31:18.780,01:31:19.610,spk_4,"judge --"
01:31:20.380,01:31:20.850,spk_3,"there"
01:31:20.850,01:32:46.100,spk_4,"is the evidence of the child, and there are the two experts reports, and then there are a number of lever arch files that contain all of the history and the documentation and the texts and the letters, in relation to what she told her friends, what her friends told their mothers, how it got to social services, what the responses of everybody was, the whole history of the thing. That is part of the evidence that a care judge would look at very closely, in terms of consistency. Of course, against the background of being very experienced at these kinds of allegations, and that is something that, My Lord, there is a lot less of in the criminal courts and the criminal courts is much more focused on the specific allegations. But the local authority, in a case like this, would be relying on all of that. And we have to take into account, of course, the fact that she has made an allegation that she has then retracted, but that is very much part of the historical background of this case that we would expect a care judge to look at in great detail, yes. And then, of course, sometimes -- in this particular case, there is the forensic evidence. So the evidence of the child, directly via the ABE interview [inaudible] --"
01:32:46.550,01:32:50.020,spk_5,"And then the stepfather will"
01:32:50.020,01:32:51.710,spk_4,"have his"
01:32:51.720,01:32:55.250,spk_5,"account before the judge, which will be cross-examined."
01:32:55.290,01:33:34.450,spk_4,"Yes, and of course in particular in relation to the retraction. And of course, it would have been open to the father, had he so wished, to call, to cross-examine all those people to whom the child made previous statements, or wrote letters, or sent texts, or who have made statements saying what this child has said to them, to cross-examine those, and indeed to cross-examine social services and the police in respect of the Section 47 investigation and the vulnerable witness interview of the staff at the school, all these people could be could be cross-examined, if the father so chose."
01:33:36.140,01:33:41.260,spk_2,"And Ms Davis, your paragraph 15, which sets out what Lord Justice Wilson said in re P, I mean"
01:33:41.260,01:33:41.870,spk_0,"that rather"
01:33:42.610,01:34:47.090,spk_2,"worries me. There it is if you don't call the child, well, then, I mean -- whether cross-examination does or doesn't actually tend to serve a purpose, I mean, you actually have to direct yourself, Well, frankly, we can't give this evidence the same sort of weight. Now, in a case like this, where on the face of it, it's the make or break evidence, that forensic evidence, the scientific evidence, I mean, as Mr -- he rightly said, I mean, it's not totally independent, so of course it's not going to carry the day, I mean, either the child is telling the truth or the child is a liar, and if it fatally weakens the case, I mean, then there could be catastrophic results, you could get the child not carrying the day in care proceedings with all the consequences of that, quite possibly a dropped criminal prosecution on the foot of it, and the child never had its word actually heard in -- tested in court in cross examination."
01:34:47.940,01:34:50.710,spk_4,"My Lord, no. My Lord, does have its words heard in court, of course, by the interview [inaudible] --"
01:34:50.720,01:34:54.730,spk_2,"Well it's only heard by the ABE -- I mean, I follow that absolutely --"
01:34:54.730,01:34:55.390,spk_4,"Yes."
01:34:55.690,01:35:17.150,spk_2,"But I mean it, and you know, if the child was there, and aware of what was happening, she's told, Well because you're not actually giving evidence in court because of the principle that you generally don't, your evidence may be fatally weakened, and you may find that your siblings returned to a father when otherwise they wouldn't have done."
01:35:17.160,01:35:28.470,spk_4,"Yes, and in those circumstances, many children would then say, Well, in that case, I'll give evidence, as much as I don't want to, I will give evidence to protect my little brothers and sisters --"
01:35:28.570,01:35:29.810,spk_2,"But does this child not get any option?"
01:35:30.610,01:35:46.060,spk_4,"and may be traumatised as a result. And may be traumatised as a result, and that is why the local authority exercises its parental responsibility to make that decision for the child, in the light of the current law. My Lord, there is"
01:35:46.060,01:35:46.880,spk_2,"no"
01:35:46.890,01:36:07.010,spk_4,"satisfactory answer, if I can put it that way, in the sense that there is no obvious and perfect solution to the difficulties in testing a child's evidence without running the risk of traumatising the child. This is a balance between two unsatisfactory solutions."
01:36:07.100,01:36:12.390,spk_0,"It is the case, isn't it, that the local authority changed its position? Yes, they did. Quite"
01:36:12.400,01:36:13.410,spk_2,"definitely."
01:36:13.420,01:36:21.400,spk_4,"They did. They did, indeed. They changed their position when they obtained the forensic evidence, that strengthened their case to the point --"
01:36:21.640,01:36:26.670,spk_0,"And you say that was the decisive -- yes -- point in the change of attitude."
01:36:26.840,01:36:34.820,spk_4,"Yes. We received -- the local authority received the police evidence which included the forensic evidence."
01:36:35.520,01:36:43.280,spk_6,"Well, I had thought that the judge brought this up of her own [inaudible], and it was at that point that the local authority changed --"
01:36:43.320,01:36:54.490,spk_4,"Yes, because by that time, the police evidence had been received. It can take -- it could be quite a difficult and lengthy process to get police evidence in care proceedings. In theory -- So it just happened that"
01:36:54.670,01:36:57.540,spk_6,"those two events coincided?"
01:36:57.550,01:36:58.300,spk_4,"Yes. [Inaudible] satisfactory."
01:37:00.710,01:37:12.340,spk_5,"But I mean, that suggests that the local authority changed its stance because it thought that it had an overwhelming case. Is that -- It"
01:37:12.350,01:37:31.770,spk_2,"doesn't sit very easily with what the guardian says at paragraph 22 of page 6. The guardian says his or her mind was changed for two reasons, closer consideration of the applicable legal principles, and then the fact that the police had charged the father of 14 offences."
01:37:32.120,01:37:32.520,spk_4,"Yeah."
01:37:33.080,01:37:35.850,spk_2,"That's not the same reasoning at all as yours."
01:37:35.920,01:37:37.800,spk_4,"It may well not be, My Lord."
01:37:39.390,01:37:42.740,spk_2,"Sorry, which [inaudible]? [Inaudible] 22 at Page 6 of the guardian's case."
01:37:43.120,01:37:45.330,spk_4,"My Lord, the guardian is a different party."
01:37:45.340,01:37:54.400,spk_2,"Well, I'm not accusing you -- inconsistent. Well, I mean, I am, but not as an accusation."
01:37:56.180,01:38:05.900,spk_4,"My Lord, we are the local authority and they are the guardian. My Lord, I've taken instructions as to the change of mind in the local authority."
01:38:06.620,01:38:10.840,spk_2,"So really, what you're saying is what, you think you'll get home without it?"
01:38:11.920,01:38:15.750,spk_4,"My Lord, that would have been the reasoning, yes."
01:38:16.840,01:38:34.210,spk_0,"The two reasons are not perhaps quite so different as My Lord is suggesting, because, no doubt the fact that the police decided to bring charges on 14 counts had something to do with the fact that forensic evidence, and possibly strong forensic evidence, was available."
01:38:34.220,01:38:37.100,spk_4,"Yes, absolutely. Yes, yes."
01:38:39.120,01:38:39.340,spk_3,"But"
01:38:39.340,01:39:20.580,spk_4,"My Lord, I think it's fair to say that very often in care proceedings, such is the volume of care proceedings and the pressure of work, that these decisions are often made very shortly before hearings. But I don't actually know, without taking instructions, how shortly before the directions hearing it was that the police evidence was received. But it may have been quite shortly. [Whispering]. Received on the Friday and hearings on Monday. Yes, I'm told all the police evidence was received by the local authority, which was about lever arch files, for a hearing on Monday, for directions hearing on Monday. So received on Friday for the hearing on Monday."
01:39:20.700,01:39:27.780,spk_2,"Perhaps the more interesting question is why, given how infinitely rare it is to call one of these children, why did you originally decide you"
01:39:27.780,01:39:54.670,spk_4,"would? My Lord, that, I have to say, is unusual decision. And it's not one, I confess, on which I have taken instructions. I can say My Lord, from personal experience in that particular area of the country, that one of the judges of first instance, who is now retired, was in the habit of calling children more often than is the norm, and that may have had something to do with it. What,"
01:39:54.670,01:39:55.290,spk_2,"in Hampshire?"
01:39:55.470,01:39:56.080,spk_4,"Yes."
01:39:58.030,01:40:02.680,spk_3,"And of course, Her Honour, Judge Marshall came from London, so she didn't know the local rules in Hampshire."
01:40:02.880,01:40:07.920,spk_4,"No, that's right. That's right. But"
01:40:07.930,01:40:09.120,spk_2,""
01:40:09.960,01:40:33.460,spk_4,"I am aware myself, bearing in mind that the -- certain of the cases have mentioned the rarity and unusualness of children being called, in Hampshire I think they were called a little more often than that, contrary to the established law, when they were in the 15 to16 year-old category."
01:40:34.250,01:40:36.420,spk_3,"But then there is a test bed --"
01:40:36.430,01:40:37.380,spk_4,"There is potentially a test bed, yes."
01:40:37.750,01:40:39.700,spk_3,"Research material there, which somebody should [inaudible] --"
01:40:40.520,01:40:44.610,spk_4,"Potentially, My Lady yes, but in the older age group, yes."
01:40:44.610,01:40:54.930,spk_6,"It's my fault, I think, but I'm not quite clear where you stand on the question of whether, on the current state of the law, there is a presumption that a child will not be called."
01:40:55.250,01:41:23.300,spk_4,"My Lord, we would say, although efforts are made to call it a guideline rather than a presumption, that is a distinction without a difference, and in effect, there is a presumption, and that if it were to be the case, currently, that one were to say there is no presumption, there is a level playing field. The first item to fall to be considered under the level playing field, would be current received wisdom from research is that it is potentially traumatic and harmful for children."
01:41:23.540,01:41:37.690,spk_6,"Well, if there is a presumption, should it be applied in a case where a child, unlike the child in this case, who says that she's willing to give evidence, where a child says, I want to give evidence, should the presumption be applied?"
01:41:38.290,01:41:41.900,spk_4,"My Lord, yes, this"
01:41:41.900,01:41:42.270,spk_3,"is --"
01:41:42.270,01:42:10.700,spk_4,"the essence of exercising parental responsibility for children, is that they do not always necessarily know what is in their best interests. A child may be highly motivated to give evidence, and have no real understanding, of the effect that that could have on the child. Obviously, it is something that will be taken into account, that very similar, similar to residence and contact proceedings. A child says, I want to live with my father, I want to live with my mother, you take that into account, but you don't make the decision based on it."
01:42:11.770,01:42:20.300,spk_2,"Is there a body of evidence which tells the views of children who haven't been able to give evidence and whose accusation has not therefore being accepted?"

01:48:42.120,01:49:45.160,spk_4,"courts have found, in various ways, ways of avoiding to do that, while still attempting to achieve a fair trial. My Lord, then, the current situation on the -- is that the ABE interview and the ABE evidence route is the best that has been devised, in the absence of any further research suggesting that something else would be better. But My Lord, it's no part of the local authority's case to say that this is satisfactory in every way, because it cannot be satisfactory in every way, from the point of view of the person on the receiving end of an allegation. Obviously, they would feel that the trial was fairer, and indeed, it would be fairer, if they were able to cross-examine. But from the point of view of the family jurisdiction, looking at the welfare of the child, that is a price too high to pay in terms of what is in the best interests of the child. [Pause]."

Am I making myself [inaudible]? There aren't a lot of judges who throw out a care case on the basis that they didn't hear direct evidence from the child."
01:50:59.880,01:51:13.680,spk_4,"No, My Lady, but there are judges who threw out a care case on the basis that the ABE interview does not disclose, or satisfactorily disclose, in the light of all the other evidence, the explanation of"

That certainly happens, that sometimes ABE interviews, what is described is somewhat inchoate or is capable of an alternative explanation, or other evidence discloses the child may well have a motive.

I think one of the suggestions in Pigott that wasn't implemented, was that that very process should happen even in criminal proceedings, in the sense that you do an ABE interview of the child, you show it to the defence, he says what he has to say about it, and his council then questions the child in a subsequent interview, that that whole process taking place in the first few weeks, and the child's job is then finished, and you then have both examination and cross-examination.

And if the police decide, that for whatever reason, that they're not going to do an ABE interview, the local authority can be left hanging. This particular case is unusual, that it was put to the judge that the local authority are also ABE trained, and that if the judge were to express herself in certain terms, the police might be persuaded to lend the local authority their facilities, because it's the police who have the facilities for conducting the interviews.

00:01:17.460,00:03:25.260,spk_3,"now? Yes. My Lord, the first thing I can say, on looking at it again with fresh eyes this morning, it occurs to us that exceptional circumstances and where there are specific justification, is somewhat tautologous, and to say it is undesirable and should only be required in exceptional circumstances, would be sufficient. The thinking behind the idea that it is undesirable for child to give evidence, again goes back to the point I was making yesterday, that that is the current evidence base, that it is likely to be traumatic or damaging. And that although one can say that there are perhaps a percentage of children who are not so traumatised or damaged, the current evidence base is not sufficient to counter at the findings of Pigott. And that it is also extremely difficult for a judge in those circumstances to be able to say, looking at a particular child, Well, you are one of those that is likely to be damaged, or you are one of those who is not likely to be damaged. Then the issue of the Article 6 rights, which are obviously important in relation, to the alleged abuser in particular. Of course, all parties have Article 6 rights, but it is his Article 6 rights that are the particular concern in this situation, and then in deciding whether there are exceptional circumstances, a list of all the matters that the judge must bear in mind, if those factors applied to that particular case. And one in particular, of course, is the age and maturity of the child, that where a child is approaching 17, or 17 and approaching 18, the view a judge at first instance takes, as to the extent of the undesirability, and whether or not that is an exceptional circumstance, may"
00:03:25.260,00:03:26.070,spk_1,"be very different,"
00:03:26.080,00:05:21.270,spk_3,"as a view a judge would take if the child was, say, 12, but it is very difficult to put specific age groups on this is, as of course, children vary a great deal. And then the other issues, which have been highlighted as important in a variety of cases, and indeed, in in Pigott, the degree of harm suffered, the support the family has from family and other sources, which is a very important point in care proceedings, as I alluded to yesterday, and the significance of the child's evidence to the case, and the strength of the other evidence, which, of course, is a matter that has arisen in some of the criminal cases that have gone to the European Court of Human Rights, as to whether there is such a test as the sole and decisive evidence test, which is a matter of issue in Horncastle, the case Horncastle, and the strength of the other evidence. So again, that is something that a court would have to bear in mind, as to whether it is simply the word of the child against an adult or what other evidence there is. And that, of course, also -- that consideration is perhaps allied with the last consideration, which is number 11, which is the ability of the alleged abuser to challenge allegations, so that if there is other evidence that is relevant, that can be tested. Passage of time since the child made allegations. That is important, bearing in mind the matter that was being dealt with yesterday.

Likelihood of any further delay, of course, delay being inimicable to children. The likelihood of children having to give evidence in other proceedings, a matter that's already been raised in many cases, given the evidence base that it's likely to be traumatic and damaging to have to repeat that experience. Evidence of harm to a child from giving evidence, including expert evidence, thought appropriate, the point at which a judge, at the first instance, is concerned that this may well be an exceptional circumstance, and is considering whether or not there is any justification for the child giving evidence in the proceedings. The judge of first instance, of course, then has to make a decision on all these issues, on evidence of harm. And that is a very difficult one, and it's a very difficult decision for a judge.

00:15:28.470,00:15:47.700,spk_3,"Yeah. Because exceptional circumstances, it's, in some respects, nothing is really exceptional in these cases. The specific justification is there needs to be a very good and particular reason as to why the general rule is not"

00:16:35.380,00:16:36.370,spk_0,"that, I"

00:16:49.920,00:17:03.660,spk_3,"It is a guideline. It is the current view that, for a child to give evidence is likely to be traumatic and damaging to the child. So"
00:17:03.660,00:17:15.110,spk_1,"in the second short paragraph, you strike out the words -- Exceptional circumstances -- yeah, whether -- you put in, Whether there is specific justification -- [pause]."

And of course, the last two paragraph's are, well, the first of the last two paragraph's is practical, of course which presents a difficulty in the current arrangements that are made, because of course, at the moment, the only way in a combined court centre where a child can give evidence by live link, is to make arrangements with the criminal courts to effectively borrow their equipment unless they have it already, and that is simply not possible in some of the smaller courts."

And the problem with cross-examination is that it does put leading"

And of course, it is going to vary an awful lot with the age and maturity of the child, there's no doubt about that, but those are reasons for saying"
00:20:31.460,00:20:31.940,spk_3,"the"
00:20:31.940,00:20:41.180,spk_0,"fact that those questions in a leading form have not been put to the child now, doesn't necessarily affect the reliability of the child's evidence."
00:20:42.150,00:20:43.060,spk_3,"No, the reliability -- I think that's"
00:20:43.060,00:20:46.440,spk_0,"what you're trying to argue, isn't it? Yes. I'm not saying I agree with you, but I'm just --"
00:20:48.830,00:22:01.150,spk_3,"No. But, the reliability of a child's evidence, really, falls to be considered in different ways, other than via cross-examination, in that one is -- would be considering the circumstances in which the allegation was made, the possibilities for the child having misunderstood, having been put up to it, the degree of vagueness in the answers it gives, the quality of the questioning in the ABE interview, which is not always of the best and sometimes experts are asked to look at that, the reasons a child may or may not have for making allegations that are not true, and also, of course, any subsequent disclosures that the child may have made spontaneously, which does happen in a number of proceedings, that are usually recorded by professionals in note form, and then fall to be considered. So there is a lot of consideration, of the credibility or otherwise, of what the child is saying, aside from"
00:22:01.160,00:22:02.030,spk_0,"cross-examining"
00:22:02.030,00:22:07.670,spk_3,"the child and saying to the child, Well, this isn't true, is it? Or however the child is cross-examined."
00:22:07.670,00:22:09.390,spk_2,"So it doesn't become, simply"
00:22:09.390,00:22:45.690,spk_3,"because the child is not cross-examined, it doesn't become the case, well, you've got the interview, it says this happened, and you have to believe the child, and that's it. It doesn't end the case simply because the child isn't cross-examined. There's still a great deal to be considered and assessed by a judge at first instance. So in attaching appropriate weight, I suppose what I'm trying to say is, one wouldn't attach less weight to a child's evidence just because the child hasn't been cross-examined. But there are many, many reasons why one might attach less weight to a child's evidence."
00:22:46.330,00:22:56.940,spk_1,"Well, I'm sorry, I mean, I recognise that cross-examination, you know, may take the child astray, one would hope a Family Division judge"
00:22:56.940,00:22:58.120,spk_3,"would be"
00:22:58.120,00:23:11.900,spk_1,"able to see through that, and not just because the child, maybe has changed in the face of cross-examination doesn't necessarily mean that the cross-examined answers are necessarily any more, or, as it happens, the other ones -- but it's"
00:23:11.900,00:23:12.730,spk_0,"just"
00:23:12.740,00:23:29.350,spk_1,"completely untested, I just -- I come from a tradition where I think if you said, frankly, it doesn't matter that this hasn't been cross-examined to, it carries exactly the same weight as if it had, I find that difficult."
00:23:30.100,00:23:40.280,spk_3,"My Lord, I think what I was going on to say, is that this would -- it's not right to say boldly, that because"
00:23:40.290,00:23:41.450,spk_0,"because it's untested"
00:23:41.450,00:24:17.920,spk_3,"doesn't matter, that is something again, that varies a great deal with the child's age, that it might well be, it's easy to say on the peripheries that it's much easier to say in relation to child of 4, for example, that there are huge dangers in cross-examination and testing by cross-examination is really not appropriate, would be a very different consideration, perhaps with a child of 15 or certainly 16 or 17, and at 17, one might well expect the child to be giving evidence in any event. It becomes much more a matter of judgement for the individual judge at first instance, when you're dealing with 11 12 year olds. Yeah but I think we have -- that's the problem"
00:24:17.920,00:24:20.320,spk_1,"-- discussed this point at some length, now."
00:24:20.500,00:24:38.620,spk_3,"Yes, yes. So the judge would have to bear in mind that, say, a 12 year old's weight wouldn't -- evidence hasn't been tested, but how appropriate would cross-examination of a 12 year old be, in any event? And is this a particularly bright 12 year old, or -- but, of course, there are other matters other than intelligence."
00:24:38.940,00:25:42.320,spk_4,"I wonder whether there isn't a more fundamental conception of justice at the root of the principle that if an accused hasn't had the chance to address his case directly to the accuser, then you would give less weight to the accuser's statements. Because I think, one is, as a result of this exercise, drawing certain conclusions about the rights of the accused, if I can use that word, and it is an elementary expectation of justice that you will have the chance, not merely to have your say, but actually to put have your point of view put, even if you don't put it directly to the other side, I don't say that it's in a sort of face to face and frowning brow to brow Shakespearean fashion, but it's in some form, and"

00:25:43.540,00:25:58.290,spk_4,"I just wonder whether, irrespective of whether you can say, Well the psychologists tell us that children are very reliable when they speak in this natural, immediate way, which I fully understand, whether there isn't something more fundamental, actually, which precludes us giving it quite the same force."

Yes, that is very unsatisfactory. Of course, the original idea of Pigott was that the child would be the you would do the ABE interview, and then within a very short period of time, the defendant's case would then be put to the child in a second short interview, not going to court and all the rest of it, but the defendant having said what his response was [inaudible] what say and --"

00:27:39.000,00:28:27.290,spk_3,"But in practical terms, it can take a series of directions and a series of increasingly vehement orders to extract disclosure from the police, up to and including orders requiring the Chief Constable to attend personally, to explain the non-arrival of certain documents. This is a not uncommon experience in the on the circuit. And then, of course, the parents are very often in a very difficult position, because they will also have criminal lawyers giving them very different advice. And although the jurisprudence is quite clear on this, that that is irrelevant to care proceedings, and there is an obligation to put your story, it's still, where you have people of limited, perhaps limited understanding and education, that is very difficult situation to be in."

I mean, the kind of child who is merely a witness apart from the obvious complete witness, who's a complete stranger who sees something, is the, for example, a child who claims that they have been previously abused but is not part of these proceedings, or a friend of the party child, or the subject child, who claims to have been abused, and therefore they do not have, very often they do not have a degree of personal involvement and emotional involvement in the matter that of course makes things so difficult for a party child or a subject child. And of course also, very often, they are likely to be better supported by their family, which is the problem with party children and subject children. Subject children, where you're in private proceedings, of course, [inaudible] completely in the middle of family conflict, and they are in a very difficult position because they have no guardian to support them, or rarely have a children's guardian to support them. There is less likely to be an ABE interview, and more likely to be allegations between the parents as to the child being used or abused and put up to things and being required to say things or make allegations and, of course, a huge problem for the child being stuck within family conflict, in terms of what a child needs, as opposed to what an adult needs, in terms of its developmental needs and its attachment needs in relation to its parents, in deciding where its loyalties lie, and where its security lies, and where its safety lies. And so a subject child, in some respects, is almost in a worse position than a party child, even though they may well be still living within the family and with a family member. That is a matter of, we would submit, considerable anxiety to the court, that in those circumstances you are unlikely to have an ABE interview -- thank you -- and therefore, if the child were to give evidence, it's then in a position of giving all of its evidence in"

00:48:10.890,00:48:24.120,spk_2,"of course, you have to go on to consider whether, in those circumstances, the presumption or guideline is removed, Her Honour Judge Marshall's decision can still stand. It is, in our submission, impossible"

We would ask Your Lordships to exercise that discretion, so there'll be no further delay in this case."
00:49:06.990,00:49:24.430,spk_4,"In that respect, I mean, the judge was obviously much better informed about the background and the facts, and so on, than we are likely to be and had seen the first interview on video, presumably."

00:49:33.070,00:50:12.250,spk_2,"I would accept, My Lord, of course, that in ideal circumstances, the tribunal who is exercising discretion should see the ABE interview, if there is one. The circumstance, in my submission, is slightly different than this case, because Your Lordships can draw from Her Honour Judge Marshall's impression of that, in respect of Charlotte going out on a number of occasions, because she said she had a tummy ache, for example, but you'll recall that Her Honour Judge Marshall made no further findings in respect of C's presentation, that she's an articulate, intelligent 14 year old, which is accepted by all the parties before the Court. There's nothing else, we say, that Judge Marshall found as a fact in watching that video, that is relevant to the exercise of the discretion."

All parties have been served the ABE interview of the second ABE Interview of Charlotte. No party has resumed their application for Charlotte to be called to give evidence before the Court next week. So [inaudible] say it hasn't been relisted before Judge Marshall. If, for example, the father in light of the second ABE interview, was saying he didn't accept the new allegations, and therefore that supported his application to call Charlotte to be cross-examined, in our submission, he should have made that application to the Court, in knowledge of the fact this case was listed for a fact finding hearing next week, and no application has been made."

The second fact finding hearing was adjourned, because on that day it was made clear that Charlotte had made further disclosures that needed to be subject to an ABE interview. It was subject to directions before Judge Marshall because the police were saying at that stage they wouldn't be involved in the ABE interview, and therefore the local authority had to get direction from the judge to direct the social workers could carry out their interview on their own.

00:55:34.690,00:56:01.780,spk_2,"Well, My Lord, clearly, that will depend on what is in it, the extent to which it takes Mr Geekie and his client by surprise, whether it's just further delineating the facts that were known to all the parties, in any event, the local authority are likely to argue it was, given that these were disclosures or allegations made by two of the children when they initially went into foster care, and given that Mr Geekie and his client have seen the content of Charlotte's second ABE interview, so nothing in there should take them by surprise."

So, Your Lordships can put it in the context of what the likely delay is going to be both to Charlotte and her siblings. We were told from the Portsmouth Listing Office that if the case did not take place next week, but were still to remain before Her Honour Judge Marshall, it could take place in May, or, likely to be able to take place in May. We also,"

And I think some of the things you've been telling us, show that these delays happen, and it's never any one party putting up their hands and say, It's all down to me.

00:59:32.280,01:00:12.740,spk_0,"has become increasingly aware of the tensions that are between the different ways in which children are treated, particularly as between crime and family, and trying for myself to track through where that unease derives from, I think principally, I identified two issues. I think first, is the recognition that from a legislative and policy perspective, special measures have undoubtedly improved the situation that was identified by Pigott, without any doubt at all."
01:00:14.200,01:00:25.610,spk_1,"There was a time, I was at the bar, a very long time ago, when quite a lot of practitioners practiced both in crime and in family, but my impression is that is quite a rarity nowadays."

01:00:31.000,01:00:44.030,spk_0,"position that I'm in, is that I prosecute and do care proceedings, and defend and represent parents or children in abuse cases."
01:00:44.150,01:00:49.190,spk_1,"Well, we're very lucky to have your shared experience of the two fields."
01:00:49.200,01:02:07.580,spk_0,"Interesting, I've also been on a jury in the last year, where we had two children's cases. So it was actually very interesting seeing it from that side of the bench, and also -- really, interestingly, how much more disturbing it was sitting in the jury box, watching it happen, from doing it yourself or watching another practitioner doing it. It felt qualitatively different, being in the jury box from the bench, which I can't explain in any way, but it was a very interesting exercise, from that point of view, anecdotally. I don't think I'm in any doubt, from my personal experience, that special measures have moved on with things enormously. And I think if you do practice cross jurisdictionally, you do frequently ask the question, Why is it that we're approaching this, really, from polar parts? Clearly the legislative framework operates in that way, and I've identified that in my case statement. Clearly the objectives"
01:02:07.670,01:02:08.730,spk_4,"are"
01:02:08.730,01:02:27.640,spk_0,"very different, but I don't think any practitioner would suggest that special measures have moved things on enormously for children giving evidence in court."
01:02:27.670,01:02:32.050,spk_4,"Would suggest or would deny? You said, I don't think any practitioner would suggest."
01:02:32.060,01:02:36.270,spk_0,"I don't think anyone would deny, that that has been the consequence of it."
01:02:37.030,01:02:40.480,spk_1,"Sorry, I'm now lost, just say that again."
01:02:40.480,01:02:49.080,spk_0,"Yes, I don't think any practitioner would deny that the introduction of special measures has improved the situation for children giving evidence just"
01:02:49.080,01:02:49.810,spk_3,"as a very general"
01:02:49.810,01:06:19.440,spk_0,"proposition. It has to be quantum leaps different for a child to be doing it via video link than confronting counselling court. And so I think that's where the practitioners come from, special measures has been a good introduction, has moved things forward. The reason I say that measuring up makes interesting reading, is because it comes from a different perspective. The practitioner's perspective is one thing, the perspective of the child going through the process is a completely different thing. And I'm going to take Your Lordships shortly to two or three passages which, we say, are worthy of particular note within measuring up, because, from my perspective reading that document, the perceptions of children are clearly different from where I would say that practitioners' are. The other specific reason why I think this overall issue has become increasingly troubling, is because of the huge increase in fact finding hearings. When the 89' Act came into force, I struggled to recollect any significant hearing where we spent a lot of time looking at the factual substrata. Now that may have been a wrong approach, but that was the way it was, and much more of the hearing was concentrated on welfare and the future of the child. I think rightly, we've come to recognise how important the factual substrata is, to the future decisions for the children. But that increase, in fact finding hearings, I think, has shed a spotlight onto this particular issue, and we would be saying to the Court, that it's important to look at this issue not just in the context of Section 31 but in the much broader context of family proceedings generally. And our overall submission is that, in fact, the issues that this Court is being asked to consider, and indeed the terms of reference of the Family Justice Council, actually throw up far more difficult issues in the private law arena, than they do in the public law arena, and I shall develop that shortly to explain why I say that. I think the third issue for practitioners is that there is a real unease about the rigid way in which the current jurisdiction has been applied to children at the upper end of the scale, and Mr Geekie took you to R"

And if you remember, Your Lordships were invited to consider the very real concerns that were being expressed by Lord Donaldson and Lord Justice Nicholls in relation to the outcome, which was attendant on the application of the principles. And can I perhaps just look at Lord Nicholls' -- Justice Nicholls' judgment, I've got it at page --"

01:07:07.920,01:08:46.460,spk_0,"My Lord, thank you very much. And the first three introductory paragraph's say nothing that's controversial, but what we do say is that -- what is quite clear from the fourth paragraph, the last paragraph on that page, is that Lord Justice Nicholls was being very specific about the disquiet that had arisen in that case. I do not read this judgment as Lord Justice Nicholls saying, I am very concerned about the application of this jurisprudence to children as a generality, what concerns me is in this present case, this child is now aged 17 years and three months, in the normal course events I would have thought that fairness and best interests march hand in hand with requiring the veracity of her statements to be established. And the same sort of concerns occur over the page for Lord Donaldson, and his second paragraph, again, reservations around this particular child at her particular age. And in a sense, those reservations reflect where we know where we are on special measures because, of course, children broadly fall out of special measures at 17, and we will reflect in due"

Now that seems to me, from what I know of this case, to be a feature of this case, but it hasn't been mentioned at all. Who's witness Charlotte actually would be if she were"
01:09:44.670,01:11:50.420,spk_0,"called? When the issue was raised on the 21st of September, and from as again, this is my first involvement in this case, so I'm sure I'll be corrected if I've got this wrong. The case was listed on the 21st of September to deal with what was apparently a disputed application for disclosure from Hampshire Constabulary, and in fact, they were represented on that day. That objection fell away again, as I understand it, outside Court. And so the matter went into Court on a general directions basis, and it was during the course of the discussion, that the local authority indicated that they were proposing, they were proposing to call C, in effect because they had no other way of proving their case. And of course, that was technically right at that stage, because there was no forensic evidence, and so on and so forth. The guardian was very troubled about that indication. She was slightly hesitant, partly because she had been out of the arena for four years, and had just come back in, and wondered if there's been a seismic shift in jurisprudence, took advice from her solicitor, who I think, would frankly say on reflection, he should have said, I need to think about this, but reacted to the situation he had. And then the suggestion came forth that in fact, it should be the guardian who should call C, if she was to be called at all. Now my understanding was that the preamble to the order which recorded that C was going to be called to give evidence, did not indicate by"

Can I say anecdotally, a case I did in Swansea last year, where a 17 year old was called to give evidence, was called by the local authority. She had undertaken an ABE interview but had made subsequent disclosures, much as Your Leadership has already identified as a rolling situation. The local authority called her, and led the new evidence, and I don't use led pejoratively, they adduced the evidence. And in fact, what happened in that case was that two questions into my cross-examination, having identified that I was with the stepfather, the witness left the video suite, never to return, and the two questions she'd been asked her about her family and completely neutral. So that was my experience, anecdotally then, that it was the"

Yes. So basically, it's somebody producing this video as an exhibit, as part of their own evidence, that's, I think, the technical situation. I think that's right. But I'm not in much doubt that the Court can direct the guardian to call any witness that the Court [inaudible] the guardian to call, I mean, that's common practice. And that's where I would see it would be appropriately lead from, particularly in this case, but to deal with the question enforcement, and of course, it's a question that I address in my case statement, and I don't think I have for myself reached a resolution, because the authorities that provide the principles that we've identified,"

01:15:33.040,01:18:30.670,spk_0,"arise in the context of applications for witness summonses. It doesn't arise in the context of an application to call the child. In each case, what is happening, is that a party to the proceedings is seeking to compel the witness to give evidence, and, of course, that's where we get the oppressive description from because, of course, the test on the summons, is whether the issue of the summons is oppressive, not whether the calling of the child is oppressive. And I think that's one of the reasons that we don't have as much clarity as I think we need to have, about the circumstances in which children might be called to give evidence. And I am concerned about enforcement, and I'll hopefully say quickly for which reason. If a court has, in response to an application by a party, indicated that there is a particular reason, an exceptional circumstance, whichever test you're going to apply, but passing that test, it is right that a child should give evidence in family proceedings, what is actually the consequence thereafter, of either a refusal by that child to give evidence, or an inability to give evidence in that the child attends at the court, perhaps sits in the room, finds that three questions in it's completely incapable of completing the task, what inferences is the Court then to draw from that position? Because if you've got a piece of evidence from a child, which the court said, There is no particular reason for this child to be called to give evidence, you attend to it carefully, you give it such weight as seems appropriate in the light will be other circumstances, but if you, in fact, have made a decision that says it's right for this evidence to be called and tested orally, where does that leave you in the event that the child won't cooperate, can't cooperate? And that has really troubled me, in terms of the inference that you then take into the family proceedings, because, of course, within the criminal proceedings, the outcome would be an acquittal, and rightly so. But that doesn't seem to me translate into family proceedings with any ease whatsoever. And so it's that sort of consequence that has troubled us on behalf of the child, is where you take the position., if you're going to say, Yes, a child must give evidence, and then it can't. Well, I mean [inaudible] ask for this, I mean,"
01:18:30.670,01:18:52.100,spk_1,"assume it's a borderline case, and there it is, the judge, not least for that very reason, thinks, Well, we better just see what this child -- whatever it is 16, 17 years old, say, as in your case, whatever -- and then the child, you know, perhaps for entirely understandable reasons, can't take"

01:19:08.980,01:19:50.190,spk_0,"Respectfully, we risk, then, putting the protection of the other children at risk. I think this is a really difficult -- because I think there are natural consequences, that you would say, Well, that would flow from it. But I'm really on behalf of the child, I'm very concerned, that if we put in place a framework which has an expectation behind it, we elevate that evidence in a way that puts other children, either the subject child and or its siblings at risk, when under the current situation, they would not"

01:19:51.450,01:20:40.230,spk_4,"they would not be, because, I mean, I thought that was precisely what the current situation was, going back to the case you've referred to R v B, ex parte P, Lady Justice Black [inaudible] said quoted the stipendiary, who said, I'll have regard to the gravity of the allegations and the fact it wasn't tested by cross-examination, she said, I'd like to endorse those comments, i.e. hearsay evidence is admissible as a matter of law, but you look at it with caution. So you are in a situation where, under the present law, judges are supposed to direct themselves that it may be necessary to give less weight, even significant less weight to it, although it's entirely admissible as of right, as you point out."
01:20:40.240,01:23:01.400,spk_0,"Yes, I think my concern comes from the next step on. Yes, but why, where does it follow? See, it may very well, the judge has seen what happened. Yes. The judge knows all the other evidence in the case. Yeah. And we're talking about masses of evidence. Of course, part of the problem with split hearings is that the judge is denied rather a lot of evidence the judge ought to have, so, I'm not a fan of split hearings myself, as must be apparent. I mean, they're good in some respects, but they're very, very bad in others. But there is a lot of material there, isn't the judge the best person to work out did this child run away because this child couldn't cope with the situation, i.e. it was all too overwhelming and too upsetting, and the child was being made to relive a very painful situation, or did the child run away because the child couldn't face being exposed as a liar? Yes. Isn't that a judgement aren't the inferences a matter for the person who's seen and heard the evidence, in the light of all the other evidence to draw, not your knee jerk, what would I do if a 40 year old man ran away from the witness box? We're supposed to understand children in these cases, that's what they're about. Yes, well, I respectfully agree, I flagged the issue because I am concerned about it, because if we start from Mr Geekie's level playing field and we have a determination that a child should be giving evidence in any given situation, do we, are there inferences to be drawn then, from the child's inability or refusal to give that evidence? And as I said, it's not a question I've really formulated an answer to, but I do think it's problematic when you come to exactly the point that My Lord raised, which is, how do you force that, how are you going to move that forward? And I think it's a -- that is a real issue within family proceedings. I don't put it forward as a major issue, but I have flagged it in my case statement, and I do think it's got to be considered in the overall context of where we are."
01:23:01.570,01:23:30.160,spk_1,"Well, however experienced and careful a judge is in forming a view, this seems to be an intelligent, composed 14 year old. There must always be a risk of total collapse with a child that age. The judge has got to do the best she can, isn't she? Nobody's going to suggest that child should be a punished for contempt of court or something, because she can't stand it."
01:23:30.170,01:23:36.590,spk_0,"No, it's not so much that, it's how it impacts on the findings that the judge has got to make."

01:26:44.050,01:29:13.500,spk_0,"funding, and so it tends to be those who can afford to pay, or those who fall right under the benefit line, and are able to claim public funding. Most of these cases are now done with at least one unrepresented parent. And it was rightly indicated earlier, allegations of sexual or physical or indeed emotional abuse, made within private law proceedings are frequently not the subject of ABE interviews, for all sorts of reasons, family want to keep it private, certainly we are absolutely familiar with the sort of last throw of the dice, I'm going to make sure that this parent doesn't have contact with a false allegation of sexual abuse. Who is going to call the child, is the child going to be called by a parent to give evidence against the other parent? Because frequently the child won't be represented within the private law proceedings. If that's going to happen, do you appoint a Rule 9.5 guardian so the child is represented, but how, then do you deal with the cross-examination of that child? We think there are really serious issues which arise in the public law arena, and ironically, we would say it's an arena in which you're more likely to find allegations being fabricated. You mean private law? I'm so sorry, private, yeah. That's the arena where you're going to find the fabricated allegation, the embellished allegation, fact finding in private law is a very, very difficult task, which is carried out extremely well by the district judges up and down the land, but the fact of the matter is that the resolution of, say, an allegation of sexual abuse within the private law arena as it stands, risks the child being called and or being cross-examined by a parent, which, in our submission, would be wholly unacceptable."

01:29:23.920,01:29:32.300,spk_4,"And all this is within the same statutory instruments, is it, which make hearsay evidence admissible automatically?"
01:29:32.300,01:31:37.220,spk_0,"Yes, and I have to say, I mean quite understand why, in relation to this specific appeal, our attention's been on Section 31, but I think it's important that we recognise that the decisions here are going to have a far, far greater import than in a sexual abuse allegation in Section 31. The inquisitorial nature of childrens' proceedings applies in private law proceedings, as much as it does in care proceedings, there may not be authority for that proposition, but it's obviously correct. Absolutely. I don't believe it to be controversial, Mr Geekie will tell me if he thinks it is, so the judge would, or the court, would be in charge in the same way, as to what to do about a particular piece of hearsay evidence, and how to arrange for it to be challenged if the judge thought that that was necessary, in the circumstances. But in terms of, if you set, and I think we are very much in line behind the local authority in terms of favouring some clarification from this Court about the current position, those considerations will apply equally in the private law arena. And I do think we have to have strongly in mind, when there is a suggestion that there shouldn't be a starting point, and I think it really goes to that point, if you start with a blank canvas, as suggested by Mr Geekie, and you just factor in all of the issues as you go, we think there is a real risk of importing into the private law arena, a completely inappropriate involvement by the child in the evidence building process."

01:32:25.460,01:32:46.130,spk_1,"better that you recognise that in every case, the risk of damage to the child, whether it be the trauma involved in giving evidence, or it be the undesirability of being cross-examined by its own parent, that that will always be a matter to be given very serious consideration."

01:33:07.100,01:34:29.810,spk_0,"we looking, when it is said, inevitably in that exercise the damage to the child of giving evidence is going to be an important weight in the balance, are we not there making a distinction without a difference? We would say it's far better, in the child's point of view, to be up front about it. We say that it isn't possible, with respect, to have a level playing field in circumstances such as this, if you've got adult competing litigants, with their different cases to run, absolutely, the same considerations apply. But when you are looking at children giving evidence, that is not, with respect, we say, the same thing at all, as an adult party giving evidence, and you have to, because of the inherent damage in it, because of that recognition, we do say that you have to put that right at the forefront with all the factors to be balanced against that in place. But we say in order to protect the child in the process, you have to have that as a starting point."

01:34:50.820,01:35:07.400,spk_4,"So, if it can't be the same force of every case, why isn't it an important factor, but nonetheless only one factor, in an exercise which actually involves a lot of people's different rights?"
01:35:07.410,01:36:45.330,spk_0,"Yes, but we would say on behalf the child, I'm afraid, that there has to be, because of that particular vulnerability, and because of the process, that there has to be some built-in protection, and we say that's the best way of doing it. Can I come to the issue of age? Because we we flag in our statement of case a possibility that we see, not necessarily for now, but for consideration in conjunction with the Family Justice Council, and I'll explain how we came up with our ages in a moment, but we would certainly say that within the factors to be considered, we can see no reason why a judge should not be told that the way in which to approach the chronological issue, is that the older the child chronologically, obviously [inaudible] with issues of physical, mental health, learning disability, that, with age, the, can I just, I'm just pausing because I. Yes, I was looking for the word that I'd written down for myself. The older the child, we say, the stronger will be the expectation that that child will be able to"

01:36:46.360,01:38:10.770,spk_0,"with the emotional difficulties of giving evidence. And we say that that should be specifically part of the counterbalancing features. So the older the child, the stronger will be the expectation that they will be able to cope. And we say, it's in that way that you factor in age, and that if you simply take out consideration at the very forefront of the decision-making process, that, and I don't think we would dissent, with respect, from the wording, My Lord, that was used earlier, that it was likely to be damaging. We wouldn't dissent from that proposition. But we say that in order to protect the child, to ensure that the process is as fair as possible, and in that respect, it's not just about fairness to the person who's being accused, it's about the fairness of the actual process itself and the results that that brings forth for a child at the end of the day.

We say there are ways in which Article 6 can be respected, even more so, than I think obliquely it is now. We do say there are ways in which that you can build in that particular issue about the older child, but we do say that to go any further than that, at this stage, without a proper evidential base for it, risks huge ramifications for the child, which, frankly, we're not in a position to assess at this stage and, you'll see from my statement of case, that we are very concerned about the child who, now, if we go down a track where that presumption, whatever you call it, the starting point, the presumption, is shifted, we say that many more children are going to be brought into the situation where they're giving evidence twice, and that's likely to be care followed by crime, in reality, that's how it's working out on the Circuit, certainly, I don't know about London, but certainly on the Circuit care proceedings coming in 6 to 8 months before the criminal proceedings"

We find that there is very, very little cross pollination between the two. And that's the reality of it.

And in a sense, I think there's a, we do have to reflect that, when we're thinking about the broader canvas and how these children are in the care system. But chapter 9, which is the chapter that I just wanted to have a quick look at in terms of children's experiences, and I do say that this makes depressing reading, because round about a third of children experiencing giving evidence, are identifying hostility, a lack of politeness, aggression, all those sorts of adjectives, from advocates cross-examining them in the Crown Court. Now, of course, that's a matter of perception, and what one child sees as aggression, its parent may see as a perfectly appropriate set of questioning. But --"

And we simply don't know what the answer is. And what we are saying is that, until you know that answer, until you've got some indication of what that answer would be, you cannot, at this stage, take a massive leap forward, and simply assume, Well, you know, the Family [inaudible] Division will get it right, people are sensible, they're sensitive in their questioning, it will be okay, because, frankly, we're not sure that that is the case. And that is why we support the work of the Family Justice Council, I have to say, because we do absolutely agree with, I think it's at paragraph 30 of Lord Justice Wall's judgment, when he said that, the time is right for us to be thinking about the possibility of change.

Now, whether these statements, these sentiments, these expressions from children, actually feed in to harm, whether quantifiable or not, is something we simply don't know, at the moment, and I think that, that for us is a real concern. But in a situation where a study such as as this, is showing that real gulf between expectation and practice, we have to be taking that into account when we decide what is the right way forward for children within the family justice system, when we can see, at least by way of a snapshot, what is happening under special measures. I feel slightly as if I'm jumping around, but the Court has heard about the evolution and the real issues, and what I'm trying to do is highlight the issues that perhaps we haven't thought"

01:54:33.330,01:54:34.590,spk_1,"This is in the RCJ?"

What the witnes sees is the back of the judge's head, and that is it, there's no direct, unless the judge physically turns around 180, the judge can't see, the witness can't see the judge's face. And so what's happening is that we are decamping down to St Dunstans House, where the video link facilities are a little better, but not much, in order to activate the witness link, and in a recent case we went down there, I think, six times during the course of three weeks. That is, I'm afraid, no way to receive children's evidence, special measures protected, or no."

I mean, if the contrary view is that, in the interests of justice, actually, you should, in a particular case, be hearing the evidence of the child, it's not a very easy answer to say, Well, it just happens that in this part of the country or London, there isn't the facility, there very well should be, and, I mean, the reality is that, if one is not able to do justice, one simply, the country is simply in breach of the Convention, but that's not a very satisfactory answer in the instant case."
01:56:26.280,01:57:44.410,spk_0,"No, it isn't that, but certainly what we would be saying is that as part of the factors that you've got to take into account, it is not necessarily straightforward simply to say we can move special measures into family, because we like the way the arrangement is structured, we've got real practical issues to consider, and that will have to take into account, with respect, the prospect of transfer between court centres, and we only flag it as a practical issue but again to be factored into the situation, because the family justice system simply isn't set up in a way that makes special measures an easy route to adopt. Now it's not, that's not a reason for not going there, but it is a reason for taking real care about how you deal with these cases and how you approach them, and Cafcass, particularly, wanted me to flag that up. We don't have to think only in terms of special measures, as they operate in criminal. No, no we don't. Of course, as I think was probably said on more than one occasion, because we are here dealing with how the court deals with, what is admissible evidence, there are a large number of other things that might be, strategies that might be adopted in order to make it possible"

The question of law is whether the present guidance gives appropriate weight to the Convention rights that are in play here, that is a question of law. Yes.

The whole purpose of that exercise is an attempt to get the best evidence from the child. And listening to the debate, it's easy, in a sense, to stand at a case which has, say, one issue, one serious allegation of sexual abuse and to say, How is it, within that context, that a court can make a decision without hearing that evidence tested? The reality is that that circumstance does not often arise because, and again -- I feel awful because Your Ladyship has such a wide experience of it, but our sense is that, when you're looking at allegations made by children it's actually quite rare to find a single allegation case. There are frequently issues of neglect, other types of abuse, which may be evident through school, or so forth.

The forensic evidence is that there are lines of ejaculate on the inside of this child's underwear and her skirt, on the back. The forensic scientist has been approached, and to her has been put the father's proposition that this could be accounted for by accidental contamination, and the position, as I understand it, is that he suggests that having had intercourse with his wife that afternoon, he removed his underwear, and wiped himself with it. That underwear went into the family washing basket and C's clothes followed it and became accidentally contaminated. The forensic scientist has said that that is an unlikely explanation, for -- Extremely unlikely -- Well, I think it's putting, two -- Well, I've read the statement -- Yes -- and if there are only two competing arguments, it becomes extremely unlikely, that's what she said.

N applied to become a party to these proceedings, and that application was considered and refused by Her Honour Judge Marshall. I can turn up the date of the order, but it's in the autumn time, and she -- Oh, because the witness statements describe her as a party. Yes, she is not a party. She's not a party. She's not a party to the proceedings. I couldn't understand why she would be, but -- No, well, quite. She was represented on two separate hearings, again, I'm gleaning this from my understanding of it, but the application was refused by Her Honour Judge Marshall, and probably rightly so. But she is over 18, she is firmly in the camp of the parents, she lives with mother currently. Query, if allegations made in respect of her by C,"

But I think it is important, in the circumstances of this case, to look at what is surrounding this because, it is not, in my submission, as plain as, she says this, he says that. And we do say it's very important also to look at the detail that is attributed by the accused,"

If you have a parent who says, Well, I remember that incident because X, Y and Z happened, and there's a different interpretation, or we need to look at the different circumstances, I think that gives a very different flavour to the hearing overall. So there's a lot of, with respect to My Lady, a lot of information that's coming into this decision, and, respectfully, it isn't just about this child against this stepfather. I can't understand what the respect to me is."

Your Ladyship said these cases are about a whole range of evidence that comes in, and it is extremely unusual, in my submission, to find a case where there is simply no other evidence bar the two competing accounts, and again, respectfully, if that is the case, as indeed it was in the Swansea case, then the decision was called -- the decision was made to call the child, and within what you have as a structure, currently, you have the room to do it.

So we would say that bulletpoint one stands, that likely to be damaging can be substituted for undesirable, and we've given careful consideration to whether it's exceptional circumstances or another phrase, and I have to say we favour particular justification.

02:15:40.690,02:16:21.970,spk_0,"Yes, I think that that's really where we are. We feel that the removal of that starting point, that -- whatever you describe it as, we feel that's a step too far at this stage, we still believe that the statutory framework, and the philosophy behind the Children Act, requires a protection for children witnesses that has to be recognised upfront. And I would say, in a sense, if you simply put it into the balancing factors, it's a distinction without a difference, because you're going to be saying to the court, Look, all other things being equal, that's the one that's going to carry the day."
02:16:21.980,02:16:45.910,spk_1,"But it probably is a difference without a real difference, that if it's a balancing exercise that the metaphor is of two scales, and you put some factors in one and some in the other, and some are heavier and some aren't.

02:16:45.910,02:17:15.429,spk_0,"we say that you have to build in a level of protection for the child witness, which is not reflected, we would say, in a balancing exercise, we say -- But if you've got a heavy weight, a variably heavy weight, but in most cases, and without any additional evidence than we already have from Pigott, that automatically goes into one side of the scale, doesn't that produce"
02:17:15.429,02:17:16.349,spk_2,"the same effect?"
02:17:20.230,02:17:24.160,spk_0,"I think our concern would be that the weight of that"

I mean, I don't think I can add to that, but we would be very concerned that if you put it into a balancing exercise, in the sense if you're saying, Well, that part of the balancing exercise outweighs Article 6 rights, Article 8 rights of other subject children, and so on and so forth, there is a, we believe, a real risk of watering down that protection, it's about maintaining that protection, and I think in a sense, we intellectually do not have a"

02:19:21.380,02:21:06.380,spk_0,"with wording that recognises and preserves that issue. The question is whether, if we put it as part of a balancing exercise, there is a tendency to water it down and a tendency to overlook that that is what drives the consideration of the court, and we say it's a far more honest, and it's a far more -- it's a far clearer message, in terms of the court's expectation of what will happen, day by day. And can I just say this, that in our consideration of this, we -- and it's a refinement that doesn't appear in here, and I want to put forward to the Court for consideration -- we do, and it comes out of a comment that Your Ladyship made yesterday, when you said, If you don't ask, you don't get, and actually that's very true because we don't ask, and we don't routinely think about it, and we think that that has got to change, and certainly what we are going -- we're submitting to the Court now, is that the question of whether a child who has made an allegation that's material to the considerations of court should be called to give evidence and cross-examined, that that must be considered in every case where that applies. So at the moment you've got a situation where the burden is on, in this case, stepfather to make the application. He drives it forward, it's for him to make that out."
02:21:06.390,02:21:07.380,spk_3,"What"
02:21:07.380,02:22:13.120,spk_0,"we would say is, if you place it as an obligation on the court at a case management stage in public law proceedings, and at the, and I'm afraid, they call them all sorts of different things, but there is a first directions hearing for the private law, that it's given all sorts of different phraseologies around the country, but at that first substantive directions hearing, where there is an obligation on the court to say, Do we have a material allegation here which may require the child to give evidence, that mandatory consideration is a huge step forward, we submit, in terms of Article 6 rights, that we accept that the burden should not be on the accuser to raise it. It's something that the court, in its inquisitorial role, should be undertaking, we believe, at this time. Sorry, I'm not"

02:22:21.870,02:22:40.130,spk_0,"This is -- is this something on which you have consulted Cafcass legal? We've talked broadly about it, and certainly there was no dissenting voice from there, and certainly the guardian who instructs me, is entirely on board with that suggestion."
02:22:40.140,02:22:41.520,spk_4,"Can I just note it down again?"
02:22:41.530,02:22:42.300,spk_0,"Yes."
02:22:43.300,02:22:43.790,spk_3,"We"
02:22:43.790,02:24:44.430,spk_0,"are saying that -- [pause] -- What I noted down and tell me if I got it wrong, is that the question whether the child should be called to give evidence must be considered in every case, the obligation is on the court in care proceedings at the case management conference, yes? Yes. And in private law hearings at the first directions hearing, the first proper directions hearing, whatever that is called. Yes. Is that correct? Yes, I think that the introduction to that was that, where -- And then you said the question was, Do we have here a material allegation, which may require the child to give evidence? Yes. And that should be considered, and rather than putting the burden on the person accused to rock the boat -- Absolutely -- stir the pond, whatever it is, whatever metaphor one wants -- and I'm sorry if that site that comes on the hoof, but it has, there is no doubt that the Article 6 element of this has troubled us hugely, and we don't feel that the process that we have now -- it's almost offensive for the person who is accused of having done something, to have to apply for a summons, because that's the way it's been happening, and we find that offensive, that cannot be the right way forward. And so we've been trying to think how you take that element, at least partially out of the equation, and it may have to be considered if the child refuses to give evidence. And, of course, if you put it into the court's consideration, that will have to be kept under review, undoubtedly, be kept under review by the court. Can"
02:24:44.430,02:25:10.440,spk_4,"I just try one idea? I mean, you were talking a moment ago about starting points. In these proceedings, the starting point, if there is one, is surely that the child's welfare is the paramount consideration, which under the statute, is given, I suppose, a slightly greater weight than anybody else's rights. But of course, there are several children or there are a number of children here involved, and someone has to feed that into this equation."
02:25:10.880,02:25:18.650,spk_0,"Yes. The interests of C would not be a paramount concern, would be an important consideration, but because of it --"
02:25:18.860,02:25:21.140,spk_4,"Yes, because they're siblings. Yes,"
02:25:21.140,02:25:41.920,spk_0,"this is not a decision about the upbringing of the child. This is the point. Technically -- Yes. -- we're talking about procedural decisions, and although it has been held, the welfare of the child is an important consideration in making procedural decisions, it isn't the paramount, governing, ruling consideration, that is when you actually make a decision about what's to happen to the child."
02:25:41.930,02:25:52.140,spk_4,"But bearing in mind that the procedural decision is really quite important in relation to the making of the proper substantive decision, I can't really detach them very easily."
02:25:52.950,02:26:35.810,spk_0,"Well, statute's clear about it, and I think that probably feeds into our feeling that -- about this being an issue as a starting point, rather than in the balance, because you don't have that paramountcy that applies to this decision. We believe that you've got to find some other way of recognising how important this decision is in terms of the child giving evidence, and because we don't have the paramountcy applicable to this, I think that's why we land up in the place of saying to you, We believe there should be a starting point, I think that's at least part of the argument."
02:26:36.530,02:26:38.690,spk_1,"Well, would that be convenient moment, Ms Branigan?"
02:26:39.530,02:26:40.650,spk_0,"Oh, My Lord, yes, I'm so sorry. Yes."

00:01:15.440,00:01:27.700,spk_2,"she? She was. Yes. Yes, it was a mistake. And in fact, she she was the subject of the police protection order as well, which was slightly harmful to the circumstances but. Oh well."
00:01:27.710,00:01:29.720,spk_1,"No doubt somebody is advising her accordingly."
00:01:31.440,00:03:19.240,spk_2,"Looking at what we say should be the starting point. Can I just consider, the issue of the welfare of the child and in the context and this feeds directly into my paragraph 47 where I say the welfare, of the child is irrelevant but not paramount consideration it links into Mr Geekie's point about whether a non subject child, so a child who is simply a witness within proceedings has Article 8 rights engaged, so not as confident as Mr Geekie on that. But what I would say is that if the court is considering a child as a witness and in no other capacity, we would say that that child's welfare is relevant and that probably actually answers the Article 8 point if that's engaged. But when we say welfare of a child is relevant, we mean for any child witness, whether a party or no. The way in which we had formulated the factors to be put into the balancing exercise came as is clear from paragraph 45 of the Medway case from the judgement of the Lady Justice Smith, where she went on to look at the various factors, she's put them in a much more generalised form. We don't have any objection to a more detailed formulation, I think you just for a moment oops, of"
00:03:19.240,00:03:19.730,spk_1,"course,"
00:03:29.970,00:03:44.720,spk_2,"yeah, okay, My Lords have that at tab 4 in the authorities bundle. Well she's"
00:03:44.720,00:04:04.130,spk_1,"basically talking about what the extra evidence will bring to the quality of the evidence before the court and the capacity of the court to do justice and reach the right result. On the one hand and the harm that very process may do to the child on the other. That's basically, what she's doing isn't it?"
00:04:04.190,00:04:11.690,spk_2,"Absolutely. And we would say that actually, the last sentence of paragraph 45 actually would not be"
00:04:11.690,00:04:14.050,spk_1,"necessary, if you"
00:04:14.050,00:04:29.030,spk_2,"had the starting point that we suggest, because that feels in the current evidential base in relation to harm children, but as I say, we don't have any substantive objection to a more detailed formulation as put forward."
00:04:29.030,00:04:32.860,spk_1,"That that that may be the head of the pin on which we're currently dancing, Miss Branigan,"
00:04:34.410,00:04:36.070,spk_2,"Whether -- yes --"
00:04:36.070,00:04:41.830,spk_1,"it's a starting point or whether it's a factor which we take for granted because it's so important,"
00:04:42.880,00:07:23.600,spk_2,"Well, can I? It links into a practical concern I have, And so perhaps it's worth dealing with at this stage. What we don't want to do in my submission is to land ourselves in a situation where this issue becomes a dominating feature of the overall case management. Our concern is that if you do not have a starting point, the court could be confronted with a very detailed inquiry simply about whether a child should give evidence and that that is not what we intend at all, but to pick up a point that Miss Davis made, it is and without making any assumptions about whether these allegations are right or not, or the propensity of that. If in fact you are a parent who has abused, it is undoubtedly in that party's interest effectively to make life as difficult as possible for the child. And we are really concerned about setting up a situation where the court has to hear detailed evidence about what the child feels about this, child thinking about it, potentially the social worker and the guardian being challenged on their analysis of whether this is going to be harmful to a child or not. I'm thinking about a sliding scale of children, whether a child of, say, the age of C is more ahead than her contemporaries and therefore more resilient. We really want to guard against that situation, and we do and I've said it several times. I'd say it for the last time. We really do believe that the court has to send the signal that the child is protected in this situation and that it is going to be, for the person seeking that child to give evidence to formulate the particular reasons, and I think that's the way it has to be. If we're going to keep this within its proper bounds,"
00:07:25.460,00:07:26.740,spk_3,"I take it the impression."
00:07:26.750,00:07:27.160,spk_1,"So"
00:07:29.270,00:07:39.050,spk_3,"there's some judgement in this case that it's an easy decision, even under the present law."
00:07:39.060,00:07:41.170,spk_2,"No.. no"
00:07:41.180,00:07:43.740,spk_3,"I don't know how long it took to argue the case in front of her."

00:07:45.360,00:07:47.380,spk_3,"know how long did"
00:07:47.390,00:08:09.980,spk_2,"certainly written submissions had to be presented for that. We certainly presented a position statement for the hearing on the 23rd of October, which I think was then amplified on a second occasion. Could we just thinking about the factors that may be placed into the balance?"
00:08:09.980,00:08:11.120,spk_4,"We would"
00:08:11.120,00:08:33.010,spk_2,"probably say that the quality of the A B interview comes high up the list. Clearly, if you have a well conducted interview, that is going to be an important part in the balancing exercise we suggest. And equally a poorly conducted interview would tend towards an argument that the charge should be called."
00:08:33.969,00:08:35.360,spk_5,"Could you switch on the machine on as well."
00:08:35.669,00:08:59.450,spk_2,"Oh I'm so sorry. That so sorry. We also think that the nature of the challenge to the allegations is important and it picks up on the keeping your powder dry issue. If you have a parent who has formulated sensibly and clearly"
00:09:00.390,00:09:00.610,spk_1,"a"
00:09:00.610,00:09:34.700,spk_2,"series of challenges to the evidence, again that would way we we submit in the balance. If you have a parent who simply said, Well, it's all a lie and is silent in every other respect that those are the two polar parts of the argument. But it may be that the nature of the challenges would be an issue to be taken into account, not"
00:09:34.700,00:09:38.340,spk_5,"the nature of the child's allegation. It's the nature of the father's response."
00:09:38.340,00:09:39.120,spk_2,"Absolutely."
00:09:39.390,00:09:48.460,spk_1,"If he's saying that can't be right, because that's something you really need to know what the child has to say about that. This is without prejudice to how you go about it."
00:09:48.470,00:09:49.570,spk_2,"Yes, because"
00:09:49.570,00:10:02.340,spk_1,"it seems to me there are many, many ways in which one could go about. But that's a very different question from his saying, Oh, she's always been a liar. She's telling lies. It's all a tissue of lies and I'm not going to tell you why etcetera."
00:10:03.350,00:10:38.480,spk_2,"And I think that also gives you a sense of the person that you're dealing with. Are they looking at this as an opportunity to make life as difficult. It is possible for the complainant, or do we have a genuine situation where the court really needs to be looking at the quality of the challenge and assessing that evidence? And we do think that's an important part of this and it may be that that direction needs to be incorporated, at the preliminary hearing where you're looking for a response to those allegations."
00:10:39.080,00:10:47.490,spk_6,"What do you say? The challenge in this case falls on the spectrum between what you described as the two polar points."
00:10:49.750,00:11:26.280,spk_2,"In terms of the statement filed within these proceedings, it says it's untrue. Having said that, there is the father's interview with the police and he has also, sorry. And he has also provided for the forensic scientists an account. And I'm not quite sure how this has come about because I'm not in the proceedings as a whole in the bundle as a whole is not here. But he has formulated his explanation for the semen being on the skirt."
00:11:26.290,00:11:31.540,spk_6,"Not likely that the child would be cross examined about that. Surely?"
00:11:32.560,00:12:11.870,spk_2,"Well, one would absolutely hope not. As I understand it, the forensic scientist is warned, and so but just thinking about that for a moment. If the forensic scientist says that's an extremely unlikely explanation, and we know that that's her position. We haven't had any sense of where the alternative lies. And so the answer to the question is, I think in this case, somewhere between the two, we"
00:12:11.870,00:12:13.230,spk_1,"don't have a very detailed"
00:12:13.240,00:12:43.240,spk_2,"excuses. But we do have the interview and we have some information, but we don't have and this isn't a criticism of your father, but what we don't have is any sort of response to the allegations of physical abuse. And I think we have our own views about the case management of it. But there it is. That is the factual situation at the moment as it stands. Nor do we have any detail from the mother about what she says"
00:12:44.560,00:12:45.640,spk_1,"about the allegations"
00:12:45.640,00:12:55.920,spk_2,"that C has made in respect of domestic violence to her and things that she's seen. We just have from Mum. I think some of that's probably right"
00:12:57.310,00:12:57.500,spk_1,"and"
00:12:57.500,00:13:37.390,spk_2,"I've shifted my position to that extent. I don't know if that's helpful or not, but I think we're sort of halfway between the two ends of the spectrum here. We would also say that the factors should include the observation that a reluctant child should not be forced to give evidence, how that we'd sort of put it above the line if I can put it in that way because it's included in my bullet points at 47 on Reflection, it may well be that that sits below the line in terms of"
00:13:37.390,00:13:50.170,spk_1,"factors that's on the harm side of it is your first three factors were on the willing to improve the quality of the evidence before me. This is a harm factor. It is."
00:13:55.130,00:14:05.820,spk_2,"Now, from my Statement of Case and I think from the arguments put forward by the local authority, I think the court understands where we stand"
00:14:06.970,00:14:07.230,spk_1,"in"
00:14:07.230,00:15:25.830,spk_2,"general terms about C and her evidence. We align ourselves with the arguments that have made that the law, as it apparently stands, was properly applied by this judge. And there's no challenge to that in this court. Question is whether you shift the goalposts, and I think what we would say is that it's the degree of movement that is probably going to determine whether the decision Per se can stand or whether it needs to be re referred to the first instance judge. And obviously we've queried whether that judge, in fact, can be Judge Marshall. Not I don't want to be in any way offensive to the learned judge, simply that she has taken a quite clear view in this case about whether or not she needs to hear the child. And I think in so doing, she has certainly given some indication about where she feels the truth may lie. And in those circumstances, it may well be It's proper for somebody else to look at it a fresh, but we don't necessarily invite specific reference to that. But I think it's an issue. Well, we've we've got"
00:15:27.470,00:15:33.910,spk_1,"a number of possible choices. Haven't been home. One is we simply dismiss the appeal."
00:15:33.920,00:15:34.410,spk_2,"Yes,"
00:15:35.610,00:16:08.510,spk_1,"things go ahead on Monday as planned. Another is that we allow the appeal and say this discretion has to be exercised afresh. Now, if we were to do that, the question would arise. Can we ask Judge Marshall to reconsider matters? In the light of the judgement of the court bearing in mind."
00:16:08.520,00:16:08.960,spk_2,"And"
00:16:10.520,00:17:15.640,spk_1,"I mean, I have to say that whatever the criticisms that can be made of her judgement or of the present state of the law. And, of course, I have read with care what Lord Justice Rimer had to say about it. This was it seems to me, a pretty full and careful consideration of the issues, whether it reached the right result or whether it gave the right weight to the right things. I haven't read a lot of judges who have taken as much care of this sort of issue as as she did, and, if she were able to revisit the issue at the outset of the hearing on Monday and supposing she were to come to the conclusion that, having looked at whatever this court says, she had perhaps given too much weight to one factor and not enough and had or applied the wrong starting point or whatever and therefore decided that she would ask Charlotte give"
00:17:15.640,00:17:16.250,spk_2,"evidence."
00:17:17.240,00:17:28.370,spk_1,"What would the guardian's view of that be? I know that Charlotte has not been told that we're talking about her today, but we do need to know what the guardian's view would be."
00:17:28.610,00:18:02.850,spk_2,"And I can tell the court exactly what that is. Can I just put it in its historical context? When the court was considering between the 23rd of October and the 25th of November, the question of whether C should give evidence, The Guardian and her solicitor of visited C specifically to ask her view about giving evidence twice. She"
00:18:11.260,00:18:11.440,spk_0,"I"
00:18:11.440,00:19:07.650,spk_2,"think, the issue was we tried to make it as straightforward as possible and simply said that an issue had recently arisen about whether or not she should give evidence in both proceedings. She was told that evidence within the care proceedings was a possibility only, she said, that she would prefer not to do that is give evidence twice but would do so but would do so. Would what? Would do so if required. And the phrase that she used, which I think is a matter of concern to the Guardian, as she was saying, Well, she could use it as a practice run for the criminal proceedings."
00:19:11.370,00:19:19.030,spk_3,"I don't personally find that very surprising. No. Sound like her reaction sounds entirely common-sensible."
00:19:19.040,00:19:41.850,spk_2,"Absolutely. But I think what it does highlight is precisely the point about actually you can't take necessarily what the child is saying at its face value because we would say a child who is saying Well, it's a practice run for the real thing probably doesn't have a proper appreciation of what's in store for her. That would be our concern about it. So that"
00:19:41.850,00:20:29.960,spk_1,"is a separate issue. What's in store for her? Yes, because one of the things that we've been emphasising with councils throughout is that there's more than one way of confronting this situation, and it doesn't necessarily entail counsel for the father. Putting questions directly to there are other ways of doing it and still enabling him to put whatever precise challenge he may have. And you've identified one example where she said she actually says what happened in her interview. As I recall, she says, What happens? Well, he might want to put to her, Well, no, didn't I do this? There are various ways of doing that, so I"
00:20:29.960,00:20:41.900,spk_2,"mean, I think that's absolutely right. I think the difficulty is, of course, that those those ideas are embryonic. So far, the justice system is concerned. We simply haven't addressed our"
00:20:41.900,00:20:42.960,spk_1,"minds to it."
00:20:44.500,00:20:59.720,spk_2,"But I entirely agree there are other ways there are various ways of doing it. What has happened subsequently is that she was told by the Guardian by telephone of the outcome of the Court of Appeal hearing"
00:20:59.730,00:21:02.340,spk_0,"this paragraph 23 of yours, isn't"
00:21:02.340,00:21:44.810,spk_2,"it? And it's the reason I included it, because I I know we shouldn't over burden with facts that it seemed important. And it particularly seemed important to me because I was struggling when I first came into this many days ago to understand how it was that this watch of information had been forthcoming on the 22nd of December about the physical abuse and what triggered that. My speculation. It's speculation only, was that having been told she wasn't going to give evidence for whatever reason, it then came out. She,"
00:21:44.820,00:22:11.680,spk_3,"I mean, that does seem rather odd. Why should it make any difference to her producing this information? Whether or not she's going to give evidence in the care proceedings, she knows she's going to give evidence in the criminal proceedings, and she said she's or indicated she's fairly relaxed about giving evidence twice, although not surprisingly, she said she'd prefer not to. I don't quite understand where this is going at the moment."
00:22:11.690,00:23:17.910,spk_2,"I think there's a, there's a real difference for her in terms of making allegations that relate to her and allegations that bring in wider members of the family. And that was really that. The striking thing about the second interview was that in interview one, it was all about her. It was contained. She was going to deal with it. The allegations are much, much broader in the second, and I think there was a real can. Our worry is that she's got a concern that if she says these things that happened to her mother, it then puts her mother into the position of having to be in direct conflict with the father of the stepfather. And, of course, that inevitably happened as a result of the first interview. But it was much more direct in terms of Second Interview and implicating the other Children and bringing them into the arena. And I think that was that was our, that's simply also amateur. Look at it from our standpoint."
00:23:17.920,00:24:04.810,spk_3,"Can we go back to the original point? Is the possibilities as to the way, the case might get? I mean, one possibility is the one that My Lady was mentioning, that we if of course, I mean she's dealt with to either. The appeal fails, if the appeal succeeds, then it goes back to Judge Marshall or you say, possibly not Judge Marshall. That's one possibility. Another possibility, I notice in the case involving Lady Justice Smith and the court actually was invited and did decide the issue of discretion itself, which is what Miss Earley was suggesting, What's what's your position?"
00:24:05.150,00:25:23.880,spk_2,"Well, can I tell you what the child's position is now? Which is that there was a real explosion, as I understand it of emotions post the 13th of January interview, with the suggestion that she just wanted to wash her hands of it all,  the Guardian senses that she's come back from that point. She's certainly more reluctant and more ambivalent about the issue of giving evidence. Now the question I posed to The Guardian was if this court or another court said that she had to give evidence in the care proceedings, whether that's something that the Guardian felt that she could effect, so whether she could persuade C that that's what she should do. I think she feels that she could, but I think she's. She's concerned that post care it's much less likely that shell, I feel confident in the criminal proceedings, so that's her assessment of it at the moment."
00:25:28.630,00:25:31.490,spk_0,"Are you going to be involved next week?"
00:25:31.600,00:25:34.780,spk_2,"But my junior is, strange looking."
00:25:37.870,00:25:38.100,spk_1,"To"
00:25:38.100,00:25:59.410,spk_2,"the question of whether this court should exercise its discretion, I think we would say it depends on the extent to which the current applicable principles are going to be revisited. I know we"
00:25:59.410,00:26:03.090,spk_1,"get it right. You're happy for us to do it. We don't exactly"
00:26:03.100,00:26:03.920,spk_2,"exactly"
00:26:03.930,00:26:09.240,spk_1,"rather we send it back to a real judge who knew who knew about these"
00:26:09.240,00:26:27.050,spk_2,"things. I'm not sure about a real judge, but I think because we do see it very much the case management issue and something that's got to be kept under review, I think we feel the further we depart from where we are currently, the more appropriate it is for the first instance judge to make that determination"
00:26:27.060,00:26:33.880,spk_5,"how late in a four or five day hearing could be decided if it was revisited?"
00:26:35.140,00:27:07.450,spk_2,"I think the problem is the preparation and of course again. We've only got the special measures to take the guidance. But you certainly would not normally anticipate telling a child even today in anticipation of three working days before the start of the trial that it was required to give evidence and then do all that familiarisation. That is a longer piece of work, even for a child who is reasonably confident about giving evidence."
00:27:07.460,00:27:08.770,spk_5,"It's a familiarisation"
00:27:08.770,00:28:23.630,spk_2,"with the video link. Yes, certainly the recommendations the child should have a visit to the court should practice, if at all possible on the link, she's going to have to review her, interviews, which are four discs in all and quite lengthy, because she's got at the moment no idea that she may be required to give evidence next week, and that's a decision we just had to take. Do we tell her about the Supreme Court or not? And the decision, a joint decision between us and local authority, was not because we just weren't confident that she could take on on board the implications of that. So we are in a position where she's completely ignorant of everything that's been going on, and I think we would say on welfare for See that if she is to give evidence in the proceedings, we think next week is going to be too soon, and certainly we would be very concerned that we couldn't do a proper preparatory job with her to ensure that that was a as least harmful experience for her as possible."
00:28:23.640,00:28:25.610,spk_1,"Let's just let's just think of"
00:28:25.620,00:28:26.100,spk_2,"the,"
00:28:27.610,00:28:32.520,spk_1,"this is obviously thinking, worst case scenario from your point of view. So,"
00:28:33.510,00:28:34.600,spk_2,"we"
00:28:34.600,00:29:02.580,spk_1,"reached considerably different conclusion on the law. We think that the only thing for us to do is to exercise the discretion ourselves because otherwise it's going to build an enormous amounts of delay, and we decide that she should give evidence, which is going to be worse, putting off the fact finding hearing until"
00:29:02.580,00:29:03.410,spk_2,"May,"
00:29:04.650,00:29:24.180,spk_1,"or a very swift and skillful piece of work by the Guardian and Social Workers. That's the worst case scenario. I completely understand that. But I'm putting it through because we need to know the answer. Can"
00:29:24.180,00:30:28.810,spk_2,"I turn my back for a moment? Guardians, who is that, C from C's Point of view, the later may would be the worst case scenario that she would understand if we went to her and said because of the decision that's been made, we haven't got very much time. So we need to do X Y and said, and she thinks that intellectually, she'd be able to process that, whether emotionally, she's going to be able to process it. We have no idea. But from her perspective, she is incredibly concerned about the siblings. She's very worried about her sibling,"
00:30:28.820,00:30:57.560,spk_0,"just to mention another hypothetical possibility. If this court were to allow the appeal and sending the matter back to Judge Marshall for her to revisit her decision in the light of a judgement are Judgement. It is most undesirable that too much of those five precious days should be spent in"
00:30:58.160,00:30:58.780,spk_2,"making"
00:30:58.780,00:31:05.570,spk_0,"submissions to the judge. I would have thought I was speaking because entirely for myself. Now it seems to me"
00:31:05.570,00:31:06.050,spk_2,"that"
00:31:06.590,00:31:37.450,spk_0,"the judge, if that were to happen, should be given a copy of our judgement at the earliest possible moment and that she should invite strictly time limited submissions as to what she ought to do. But if that were to happen, of course it's for case management for her to decide how long to spend on it. But if she were, she probably would want to know what C's attitude was as far as anyone could tell her on Monday morning."
00:31:37.460,00:31:39.690,spk_2,"Yes, we would certainly do that."
00:31:41.200,00:31:42.160,spk_0,"As"
00:31:42.160,00:32:09.770,spk_2,"I say, it was a decision that we took. But we've certainly not hugely fearful about an adverse reaction if we went to her and said, Look, the decision is being reviewed. I don't think we probably even put it in the context of Supreme Court would simply say that the decision had been reviewed and that she was needed to give evidence. And we'll need to put her through the preliminary bit reasonably rapidly."
00:32:10.310,00:32:13.730,spk_1,"Some 14 year olds would be proud to be making law in the"
00:32:13.740,00:32:14.260,spk_2,"Supreme Court."
00:32:14.270,00:32:15.830,spk_1,"We'll"
00:32:15.830,00:32:43.130,spk_2,"probably tell her about it later on. But I'm not sure that in the context of what she's got to make sense of immediately, I'm sure we'll have the wider discussion in due course. But I think if she's got to make sense of a situation where she has now understood for some months that she hasn't got to give evidence, that's changed and next week's that the week I think there's a limit to what we should be telling her at this stage and how she should make sense of that."
00:32:43.250,00:33:03.280,spk_5,"If the matter on My Lord scenario goes to go back to the judge for her to decide a fresh on Monday, I mean between now and Monday, or presumably in order to make it a real possibility of the child could then give evidence if the judge so exercises the discretion of the child, will have to be informed asap and started."
00:33:03.740,00:33:05.140,spk_2,"Absolutely. Yes,"
00:33:05.140,00:33:07.050,spk_5,"we were training process would have to"
00:33:07.050,00:33:49.580,spk_2,"start. We wouldn't delay in those circumstances, and we tell her that in fact she may be required and we want to show her the court, and we would we would do that. This guardian would undertake that she has a good relationship with this child, as does in fact, the social worker. And simply the practical point that I would want to be clear about before we undertook that exercise is that in fact, there's going to be a video link available at Portsmouth because we have no idea about that. We have to book the Criminal court in order to do that, and so that that information would have to be fed in. What"
00:33:49.580,00:34:42.260,spk_3,"concerns me is I mean, it took two months to sort out this issue and get a very comprehensive judgement last time. If we send it back now, despite what My Lord said, isn't there a real risk that an awful lot of time is going to be taken? And then on Monday, the judge is going to want to take time to put our reasons in writing and inevitably, next week would be at risk, and there's the additional factor that if we send it back now, you will have to tell you see of a risk what's she going to think of the legal system? It goes one way or another, like an electric switch, and she then she's got to be in suspense for a week and maybe the switch is turned off again and she's not giving evidence on Tuesday. I just wonder whether it's a very realistic to say that"
00:34:42.270,00:34:43.300,spk_2,"and"
00:34:43.389,00:34:44.450,spk_3,"keep the date."
00:34:44.700,00:34:55.320,spk_2,"The risks attendant on all of that. But we have got to keep see central to the considerations and if,"
00:34:55.990,00:35:09.290,spk_3,"well, what I'm suggesting, I'm just coming back to the point that I put before and it may be, it may be that I'm overlooking something, but wouldn't it be better to have a decision now if we got to that point?"
00:35:09.640,00:35:47.600,spk_2,"But I'd absolutely accept that as a matter of principle. What I'm saying is that we shouldn't shoot on the decision into that. If in fact Your Lordship Decision moved significantly away from where we are, we have to look at completely different applications, discretion that that's the only thing that concerns me about it. I fully recognise the thoughts of the point it's going to. It's going to depend, I'm afraid, on where the decision falls into course. But we have to keep see central to the consideration."
00:35:47.600,00:35:56.420,spk_1,"Which is why I asked about her comparative guardians view of her comparative view of delaying next year's hearing and"
00:35:56.930,00:35:57.690,spk_2,"not being"
00:35:57.690,00:36:06.000,spk_1,"faced with the sudden requirement that people might want to put some questions to her. I'm keeping an open mind about how that might be done."
00:36:06.000,00:36:35.730,spk_2,"Yes, and I don't think we're particularly driving any point. And at the conclusion of my submission, I put forward a series of propositions, I don't think any of them is necessarily perfect or imperfect. It's where we are on the timetable, and I think we've got to do the best we can. Provided the best we can, doesn't cross a line, which then becomes in a court to seize well,"
00:36:36.540,00:36:50.730,spk_5,"the video link. You only need it for an hour. I don't know. I mean, nobody is obviously asked the Port Court at Portsmouth whether that court is free. But you only need it free for a very short time,"
00:36:51.560,00:36:51.990,spk_1,"wouldn't"
00:36:51.990,00:36:52.340,spk_0,"you?"
00:36:55.030,00:37:22.820,spk_2,"I think it's very much. I'm not sure that's necessarily right, because, of course, the physical allegations now involve the mother's team. Fairly significant if the mother's position is that she denies the reported violence meted on her and the Children in her present. That's a detailed piece of cross examination. I frankly be astonished. If you're looking at less than half a day,"
00:37:25.090,00:37:39.950,spk_3,"How can you cross examine on that? I mean, one doesn't know what the allegations are, but it sounds like the sort of cross examination which says it didn't happen. How that can go on, especially with a child for any length of time. I find"
00:37:39.950,00:37:48.290,spk_2,"difficult. Yeah, I mean, it does. I'm afraid it does, and well."
00:37:48.290,00:37:58.780,spk_3,"That may be a very good reason why people don't shouldn't be allowed to cross examine two very often, but if it happens, But it sounds if it's a a"

What might be the right answer is formulating precise points of challenge to precise points made by the child and enabling those simply those to be put, maybe by counsel for father, maybe by counsel for mother or through an intermediary who might be the judge who might be somebody else rather than but but questions in advance rather than the sort of fishing type cross examination that were all too familiar"

I mean, it's very analogous to the unimplemented Section 28 but a situation where a child has asked a series of questions in a video interview we think could be a very significantly positive way forward. When you're looking at these sorts of issues, in reality, I think it's it's not about a child not being challenged. That's not the concern. It's not about blindly accepting that children say what I think. The real fear is is that children will be exposed to, to use Your Ladyship's words, a fishing exercise, particularly when you're looking over your shoulder at criminal proceedings. Because as night follows day, there'll be applications for that, that evidence to be transcribed so that when the child says something slightly different in the criminal proceedings, previous inconsistent statement will be fit.

And I think we we potentially have a huge opportunity to take things forward in terms of how we think about the reception of evidence and how we challenge and how parents can legitimately challenge the Children without it turning into that sort of practice run for the criminal proceedings.

Let's grasp it, and it's about how you make those sorts of imaginative proposals for Children. And I think, from where we stand, that's, I think, ideally, where Miss Jones and I would have liked to have taken out our thinking in the course of these submissions.

00:48:44.650,00:51:52.300,spk_4,"those in the light of submissions that have been made. My Lord, may I make a brief comment upon just a few matters that have been raised Firstly, the discussion that has taken place in relation to the ABE interview and its status as the best evidence. I don't contend the proposition for one moment that in the case of a child who has been abused, it is likely to be the best evidence. But the difficulties we apprehend it is that it does not deal with the difficulty of testing in an account, which may not be true, so that that is the heart of the difficulty for those cases where there really is an issue as to reliability. The ABE interview, because of the careful manner in which it is, produced, may disguise rather than reveal difficulties. May I just say a word about some of the exchanges that took place in relation to what was styled very loosely. I appreciate the old Bailey cross examination, but certainly I'm sure we all understood what was intended by that loose styling in a criminal case. It may well be that there are limitations upon the degree to which a Crown Court judge can intervene the reasons for that particular to the jury trial. But in the family case, we certainly would accept that a family judge has a continuing duty to safeguard the welfare of a child who is a child witness and in those circumstances, in the way that was canvas to a degree in submissions, I think particular between myself and My Lord, Lord Kerr, it would be the duty or certainly available to him, probably the duty of the family judge, too. Be more interventionist in relation to the way in which cross examination is conducted, and certainly if one is, I appreciate My Lady has raised other matters about how these things can be done, and I'll come to that in just a moment. But if one is thinking in terms of cross examination will be through, albeit through a live link, this court could make clear we would submit that it is the duty of the judge to continue to control the process. A live point of that is the point that I made yesterday about the status of the child, who is a simple witness, what I call the stranger child. And there any Article 8 rights they have. The way in which I hope will certainly intended to put that is that it's that individual, that child before the court, has a right to respect for private life, and these processes are intrusive into private life total that extent that child has, the court has to look to that child's right. That consideration will be considerably more circumscribed when one is the subject child. But the point is that in any case of any child witness before the court, the judge would have a continuing duty and therefore would be obliged to have control over the way in which the cross examination proceeds. So the"
00:51:52.310,00:52:32.530,spk_3,"real trouble in these cases is that in the absence of any actual positive explanation or positive case, I suppose there may be a positive case in the present case in the sense that whatever you said is motivated by jealousy, right. But in the absence of any positive case about the alleged facts, cross examination usually reduces itself to asking the witness to go through the whole story all over again and then hoping that in some respects the account is slightly inconsistent and then building on them. And that is a very lengthy exercise. And I've often thought entirely unproductive, but maybe"
00:52:32.570,00:53:05.890,spk_4,"cases. I recognise the difficulty, My Lord, and I don't disagree that that is what sometimes occurs. Whether it should do or not is perhaps a different matter, but I would respectfully submit that often. The more important and perhaps more effective, cross examination is when one is looking at surrounding details. Because if these cases have background and if they are surrounding details that are not credible or don't conflict with other evidence that can sometimes give a road into understanding more about what the child has had to say."
00:53:05.900,00:53:50.460,spk_3,"What I understand what actually I think to some extent seen on the continent, is whether question is actually done by judge. And it may be with an intermediate with the same. The witnesses, in fact, effectively given their previous story and then our supplementary questions on the assumptions. On the basis of that, I think to an English cross examiner that giving too much away in the sense you're helping the witness too much might be the view. But it was certainly a much shorter process, you say, Judge says, You've said this before. Now I want to ask you just these questions, but it seemed to me with a child that might be quite an appropriate way of dealing with it, but it may be it's anathema to someone in your position"
00:53:50.470,00:53:51.330,spk_1,"well,"
00:53:51.370,00:57:32.360,spk_4,"I would suggest that many family advocates would recognise that long and head on. Conflicted cross examination about the details of the event itself may be very unproductive. It may have a different impact on in front of a jury, I don't know. But many take the view that to examine surrounding detail to examine points which can reveal whether the child is reliable or not and can reveal context and background can be more productive. And the point about that cross examination is it's less likely to be traumatising for the child. It's not one of the key concerns, of course. This is asking the child have to relive the event, and that is a supremely sensitive arena. Other questions which can be revealing, can be illuminating, for the tribunal can be in relation to aspects which are less difficult for the child. And so I simply invite the court not to approach on the basis of it has to be a you did. You didn't in relation to the the events themselves, but there can be much more that can be revealed and of assistance to the tribunal of fact. Well, My Lady, turning to the alternative proposals about other means in which this might be done. I've made submission already in relation to what we say about the standing or position of the work to be done by the family justice counsel in relation to this hearing. I don't propose to go over that submission again. The court has our position on that. Of course, I would accept that the Family Justice Council will be able to not only provide a depth and breadth of evidence, but also they will be able to advise on policy and practice. And all of that might inform future practice. What has been in a sense canvas before this court in the course of yesterday afternoon and today is the possibility of some form of Section 28 of the Youth Justice Act, which has not been brought in crime of the prerecorded cross examination being deployed within family proceedings. My Lord, I simply say in relation to that that that does seem to us with respect to involve such broad issues of policy and practice that although it might be something upon which this court could pass comment as to, the virtue of further investigation, as did indoor indeed did. Lord Justice Wall in S and W and W. We would respectfully suggest it would be. It's difficult to see how it could be a direct outcome of a hearing such of this, which is concentrating upon a specific legal test. May I just touch briefly on three or a couple of final short subjects? The question has arisen about the father's position in relation to any further application arising out of the interview. The Child on the 13th of January, 13th of January. My Lord, it's been quite impossible to contemplate putting that issue before Judge Marshall, because at all stages since the 13th of January, the question is to the appropriate test that Judge Marshall should have to apply if she had to reconsider. The matter has been under judicial scrutiny, as at the 13th of January, the Court of Appeal decision was pending that was promulgated, I believe on the ninth of February, and within days of that, this court has granted permission for the matter to come back to this court. So it's been quite impossible to invite Judge Marshall to reconsider that issue without her having available to her the test that she should apply."
00:57:34.920,00:57:36.400,spk_1,"Nobody's suggesting otherwise."
00:57:37.370,00:57:43.980,spk_4,"I perhaps I misunderstood. But I thought was a suggestion that the father perhaps should have taken it back in relation to that if I misunderstood,"
00:57:43.980,00:57:46.410,spk_0,"that may have been a bit of a suggestion."

00:57:49.430,00:59:06.550,spk_4,"Finally, My Lord, the question of private law proceedings has touched upon by Ms Branigan. I believe in our written documentation. We recognise that the issues that are raised rising from this specific case were likely to have equal ramifications for private law proceedings. And it certainly would be consistent and right that whatever test there is should be applied equally in each is our submission. We also recognise and did so in the documents the additional particular difficulties that touch upon family private law proceedings because very often the parents are not represented, and the any account from the child does not come through independent sources in the way that it does in public law proceedings. And those are very real difficulties. I don't dissent from that. We also pointed out in our document that a similar situation can manage us in. The situation can arise in public law proceedings, where often now you have interveners who are individuals have been a legislative done acts and adjoined to the proceedings to make their representations in relation to those matters. And they, for similar reasons of public funding, will not have lawyers representing them. So it's a situation that does arise in public proceedings as well."

Well, the court is very grateful to all those who have been involved in presenting this important and difficult to feel short notice whether you've made all solutions to us or not. And we will consider our decision and, we will immediately proceed to considering what I might call the logistics of how we get it out. I think it probably would be useful if someone from each team could remain available for the next half hour. That's not say we're going to give a decision within"
01:03:44.920,01:03:46.030,spk_1,"half"
01:03:46.030,01:04:19.650,spk_0,"an hour, but we may be in a position to tell you when we are going to do it, and that's not so. You need to stay in court or anything like that. If someone from each side could be around for half an hour with yeah, and it is likely, but not certain, but likely that what we announced in half an hour, we'll involve having someone here tomorrow morning but we will give you further information about that as soon as we can."
01:04:21.200,01:04:27.750,spk_4,"Well, thank you. So long as it's council for each party. Would the court be content?"
01:04:27.760,01:04:32.340,spk_0,"I thought I said that. What did I say? No you probably did"
01:04:32.530,01:04:34.450,spk_4,"I'm just thinking of a commitment tomorrow morning."
01:04:34.450,01:04:37.080,spk_1,"Which somebody thank each party."
01:04:37.110,01:04:38.690,spk_2,"I"
01:04:38.700,01:04:47.710,spk_0,"think it would be useful if someone from each party could be around for the next half hour. And it is likely that someone from each party should be tomorrow"
01:04:47.710,01:04:49.530,spk_4,"morning. I'm sure it's clear. First time. Thank you."
01:04:49.540,01:07:52.690,spk_0,"Thank you. Yeah. The court has reached a unanimous decision as to the disposal of this appeal for reasons that we hope to hand down in writing at 9:45 tomorrow and the order we propose to make. And this obviously is subject comments on drafting that they can result tomorrow, the order we propose to make is one. The appeal be allowed. Two, the fact finding hearing fixed in the Portsmouth County court for the eighth of March, 2010 is to proceed. Three, the question whether the child C give evidence at that hearing and then in parenthesis and if so, in what way and a parenthesis be remitted to her honour Judge Marshall, to determine in the light of the judgement of this court. Four, there be no order for costs except for detailed assessment of publicly funded costs and subject to anything which anyone feels obliged to raise straight away. We will return to it to this so far as necessary when the reasons are handed down tomorrow morning. Yeah, well, and and we are obviously very conscious indeed of all that needs to be done between now and next Monday. And that is why we thought it right as we had reached a unanimous decision to let you know straight away. And the reasons will be made available. Just, just as soon as we can. Thank you very much."
