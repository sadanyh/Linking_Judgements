The introduction is made the 10th of September, and it refers to the trust established as you would have seen earlier under Section 3 of the ordinance with its registered office, is that Islamabad and Dallah my clients and the introduction says the trust is interesting in leasing reliable housing facilities and whereas Dallah owns adequate, appropriate real estate and the Clause 1 is the obligation of Dallah to develop and construct the necessary accommodation. Clause 2 is important. The total least value of the land area of 22,000 square metres and the total construction cost of the housing it is computed at respectively. 210 million, 135 million aggregating $345 million out of which the trust shall pay a lump sum of $100 million to Dallah by way of advanced lease payment within 30 days from the date of the execution of this agreement by the parties subject to Dallah arranging through one of its affiliates a U. S dollar 100 million financing facility for the Trust against a guarantee of the Government of Pakistan Dallah submitting it to the trust performance put Bond and then a counter guarantee issued by the Trust and Al Baraka Investment appointed by the Board of Trustees in favour of the government of Pakistan. So, in order for this to get on the off the ground, the trust has no money. It borrows the money from Dallah but before Dallah is prepared to lend the money it has to have a guarantee from the government.

This is after the trust has come into existence, and it says further to our various discussions, I'm pleased to set forth below the implementation schedule covering the provision of pilgrims housing in Mecca. And there, then there are proposals set forward, and if you go over the page payment plans, we are proposing two options by which the government could take these buildings from us and the first stop, the following agreed assumptions have been utilised in order to develop the payment plan and a number of the first plan. Number three a down payment of $100 million from the government of Pakistan has been assumed Dallah will arrange for the lane. So in the first option, the government itself is putting forward the money against alone. Then there's a plan A advanced rent plan B partial formulae, 12,000 pilgrims will be free for the government of Pakistan and the government of Pakistan will pay us 395 per pilgrim and then legal issues. In order to comply with the legal requirements of the various entities involved. The structure will be as follows the government to set up the trust Trust will borrow from Albaraka Trust will make the down payment trust will enter into the lease in order to provide the government maximum flexibility. We would propose that the government retained the following two options. The government has the right for a period of five years to develop housing on the remaining land, and the government has a right to buy the lease outright during the 1st 10 years at a price of 345 million, minus the event already paid. So you will see then it is clearly the negotiations with the government. The structure will involve the trust and one sees that again at page 115 moving along in the year. It's not a very easily legible document, I'm afraid.

Dallah is a part of the Dallah Group. And it's been involved in the formation of holy places in Saudi Arabia for over 80 years, providing services for pilgrims visiting Mecca and is the largest provider of such services in Saudi Arabia. An important piece of background information is that in the context of what happened here is that Dallah has for a number of years been one of the largest lenders doing business with the government of Pakistan. It's been an active provider of Islamic finance to the government for to the tune of some $365 million in the five years before the agreement, and it's therefore established a relationship with members of the government and the proposal was put forward. And you see that just for your note paragraphs 55 to 58 of Mr Nafis' witness statement.

1	p1,00:05:55.910,00:08:20.215,spk_0,	True	Counsel: This has a much wider implication, that was the only point I was making at the state. My Lord, as Your Lordship knows, but just for the benefit, perhaps, of those behind us. The case concerns enforcement of a unanimous ICC arbitration award rendered in Paris by an eminent international tribunal, comprising Lord Michael Mustill, Dr Nassim Hasan Shah, former chief justice of Pakistan, and Dr Ghaleb Mahmassani, who's a Lebanese lawyer who was the chair. In 1995, Dallah, my clients proposed to the government of Pakistan the idea of providing housing in Mecca for pilgrims performing hajj. This in due course led to a memorandum of understanding on the 24th of July 1995 made between Dallah and the government and later on the 10th of September 1996 to the agreement the subject matter of this appeal. The agreement was on its face, stated to be made between Dallah and the trust, a state entity. The respondent, the government of Pakistan was not a signatory to the agreement, nor was it named as a party. Had it been, we would not be here today, the first issue before the tribunal and the focus of the English proceedings concerned whether or not the government was a party to the arbitration clause in that agreement. The tribunal found on the law and on the facts that it was. It subsequently found the government to be a party to the underlying agreement and in Dallah's favour on liability and awarded it 18,900,007 odd dollars in damages. Together with costs, the government did not waive jurisdiction before the arbitral tribunal and has asserted sovereign immunity. If, however, it is found to be a party to the arbitration agreement, it is deemed by virtue of Section 9 of the State Immunity at 1978 to have waived its immunity in relation to the arbitration proceedings that is different from enforcement against assets. Dallah obtained leave to enforce the award as a judgment of the English court. This was challenged by the government under Section 103(2)(b) of the 1996 Act. The basis of the challenge being that it is not valid under the law to which the parties subjected it or failing any indication thereon under the law of the country where the award was made.
1	p1,00:35:15.460,00:38:35.260,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Can I just take you to the agreement? Because before I do so, let me just take you to a letter of the 18th of July. Page 28 which indicates that the Cabinet had approved in principle in December the proposal for the establishment of the trust. I think that's all you need to know about that at this stage, and it will over the page. The intention is to establish a separate fund known as the savings and investment fund. We then go to the memorandum of agreement, which is referred to, but I think it's easier to read it in full and that's a page 30 and this is dated the 25th, fourth, of July 1995. It's made between the president, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Dallah, and Clause 1 requires Dallah to acquire within the Holy City lands necessary for the development and construction of the housing facilities sought by the government. For Pakistan pilgrims while performing hajj and umrah is more specifically described in the schedule, its Clause 2 sets out, the cost of the land and the housing facilities to be constructed thereon. Clause 3, upon the completion of the housing facilities, Dallah shall demise and lease them to the government along with the land. And the government should take the said facilities and land on such lease for a term of 99 years, subject to Dallah arranging the necessary financing for the government on terms approved by the government in accordance with the provisions of this agreement and then four within 30 days of the execution here of Dallah shall prepare and submit to the government for its approval the terms and conditions of the proposed lease and the detailed plan for financing of the same. Approval and acceptance of the lease and the financing plan by the government will be communicated in writing to Dallah. The date of receipt of such approval by Dallah will be the approval date, where such approval and acceptance is not conveyed by the government. Within 90 days of so admission of terms and conditions of the proposed lease and detailed financing plan by Dallah, the government or the government conveys its disapproval or non acceptance of such terms and conditions and finance sink plan. No liability of claims will be incurred by either party. Five, the least financing to be arranging organised by Dallah as per the approved finance plan will be secured by the borrower designated by the government under the sovereign guarantee of the government, within 60 days, Dallah should prepare and submit detailed specifications and drawings of the housing facilities based on the requirements of the government and within 24 months from the date that the government improve approves the specific occasions and drawings. Dallah will develop construct complete in all respects and hand over vacant possession of the housing facilities to the government upon execution and registration of the lease and then, if you could jump kindly to clause --

1	p2,00:48:30.630,00:51:57.500,spk_1,	True	Counsel: It is indeed. And this is from Walter Martin [inaudible] acting for the Government, Your attention is invited to your notice at the 29th of May, in respect of the above matter where our client is required to file its answer to the request for arbitration within 30 days. We wish to bring to your notice that our client has filed legal proceedings in Pakistan, which are pending in the court of Civil Judge First Class Islamabad and are fixed for hearing on the 13th of June 1998. The learned Judge has been pleased to grant an interim injunction pertaining to the dispute. Copy of the court order is attached for your information. And then draw attention to Section 35 of the Arbitration Act, No reference or award shall be rendered invalid by reason only the commencement of legal proceedings on the subject matter of reference, but when legal proceedings on the whole of the subject matter of the reference has been commenced between all parties to the reference, notice there are the arbitrator or umpire, all further proceedings in a pending reference shall, unless estoppel proceedings is granted, under Section 34 be invalid. In this section, the expression, parties to the reference, including any person claiming under any of the parties and litigating under the same title. And the point that, perhaps, is obvious in which the Tribunal made from this is of course, this is the first response to the request. It nowhere says that the respondent is not a party to the Agreement. What it says is we now have an injunction obtained, as it was, without notice from the Government, please do not go on with the arbitration. The next document is the next page, which is the 15th of August. The same lawyers also to the ICC, referring to two further notices, We wish to bring your kind notice that our client has already declined to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Arbitration. It may also be brought into your kind notice that our client does not and shall not submit to the jurisdiction of the ICC. Inter alia the following reasons. There's no contract or arbitration agreement between our parents and Dallah. The contract and arbitration agreement referred to by the claimant were entered into by the claimant, and the Trust. The Trust has already ceased to exist after expiry of the Ordinance. Clause 27 of the contract provides that the Trust may assign or transfer its rights and obligations to the Government without the prior consent in writing of Dallah. The Trust never assigned or transferred its rights and obligations. Contract was entered into and executed in Pakistan and under well established principles of law it's governed by the laws of Pakistan, hence the Arbitration Act is not applicable. Any award passed by the ICC will not be enforceable, being against the public policy and laws of Pakistan. Under Pakistan law, the application of the Protocol on Arbitration Clause's is limited to contracts which are considered as commercial under the law enforced in Pakistan. The contract in question was entered into for religious purposes to provide housing facilities to Pakistan pilgrims. Therefore, the laws of Pakistan don't recognise the protocol and arbitration clauses. Our client never agreed to make a submission to arbitration, and unilateral submission to arbitration by the claimant alone doesn't constitute actual submissions under the laws enforced in Pakistan.

I'm directed to state the proposal submitted to you on behalf of Dallah, regarding selection of the Trustee Bank and development of Mecca housing project were considered in the following decisions were taken. Trustee bank, It's been decided to appoint Albaraka Islamic Investment Bank as the trustee bank and permit the bank to use its subsidiary all Tofik to carry out functions of the trustee bank on its behalf Mecca Housing Project. The plan be given in your letter of the 29th of February, which we saw is accepted subject to the following conditions and modification. The trustee bank will mobilise savings both in rupee and dollar. The saving mobilised abroad will be utilised towards payment of $245 million while the savings mobilised in Pakistan will not be transferred outside Pakistan accept the payment of expenses of Hajj when they are actually proceeding to perform Hajj and then it deals with the position where it's not possible to defray the cost of construction from the dollar savings and then two land as well as buildings are leased out to and at this stage it's still government of Pakistan slash Hajj trust in 99 years over the page construction plan already submitted and this becomes relevant with the proposal furnished in 1995 will be adopted so that the plans previously submitted will be adopted on the basis of land measuring 22,000 square metres with construction era of 336,000 square metres and then five Proposal regarding arrangement of 100 million foreign currency loan at interest margin of 2.5% per year and 12 months libel or fixed interest of 8.75% per year. Whichever is less is agreed, the interest will be paid annually while the principal would be paid 36 months after each dispersement date is guarantee will be invoked only if the trust and a trustee bank provides rupee cover for the repayment of the loan. In case the projects not completed, the loan will be transferred to the Dallah Real Estate. Further clarified that the loan of 100 million will be raised by Dallah Group on the guarantee of the trust which will be counter guaranteed by the government of Pakistan. Further action be taken in the light of the above decisions and in accordance with the provisions of the trust.

1	p1,01:13:31.990,01:15:08.340,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Because, as I showed you earlier on, there were various structures that were considered. It was part of the Islamic financing, and that was the structure with the government had agreed as the means of achieving the objective of providing housing for the pilgrims. My Lord, as I said, I accept entirely that, and I must deal with it, even though it is perhaps not in my favour, it's only right, that I should take you through this. So I was just at four. That Dallah will develop construct, complete the housing in accordance with the detailed specifications. Just one point to note because it becomes relevant later, is that there is no obligation, as I said, to send the specifications at this stage simply that they need to be approved by the trust. 5(a), the trust irrevocably and unconditionally agreed to take on the lease return of 99 years. Then 5(c) agreed between the parties upon the execution of the lease agreement. The advanced lease payments would be a portion as payment for the entire period of the lease. In respect of such portion, the leased premises provides accommodation 12,000 pilgrims. And then there's a provision which perhaps I can just summarise whereby you can pay less by paying earlier rather than wait for the whole of the 99 year period to elapse. And then other clause's I need to take you to I can jump.

2	p2,01:26:31.980,01:29:28.290,spk_1,	True	Counsel: This is common intention. I'm not going to read it all, My Lord, I'm just going to select points because a lot of it already, but just to summarise, I mean 8.1 deals with what happened and the introduction of which you are now familiar. If you go to 8.2, the tribunal makes the point having explained the overlap, and I'm using this as a neutral word because there isn't, we're not running the alter ego argument, but the overlap between what the Ministry of Religious Affairs does and what the Trust does, consequently, the defendant, by signing the MOU, was conducting an activity which falls normally within the functions entrusted to it by the applicable rules. At 8(3), Thereafter it was the defendant by an act of sovereignty, took the decision to establish the Trust on the 14th of February, pursuant to Section 3 of the Ordinance in exercise of powers conferred by Clause 1 of Article 89 of the constitution, which empowers the president to promulgate an ordinance when the national assembly is not in session. Next paragraph, It was the defendant that defined the objects of the Trust and determined the functions that were to be delegated to it, and that included the function of adopting measures for facilitating the performance of Hajj. Then it goes on to deal with the overlap of the functions dealt with by the Government and the Trust, and then 8.4, The organic control of the defendant over the Trust resulting from the Ordinance provisions regarding the composition of the board of the Trust, the Government's prerogatives as to certain functions, though insufficient to lead to the disregard of a separate legal entity of the Trust, as explained above here, constitutes nevertheless an element of evidence as to the true intention of the defendant to run and control directly, and indirectly the activities of the Trust. And this part is not open to me to view the Trust as one of its instruments because I'm not arguing alter ego. He then again goes through the various parts of the Ordinance which we've been through. 8.5, This conclusion is confirmed by the continuous involvement of the Government in the negotiations with the claimant, despite the establishment of the Trust in fact, before the signature of the Agreement and in spite of the recent establishment of the Trust on the 14th of February, all correspondence concerning the finalisation of the pending matters in the project continued to be exchanged with the Government itself, MORA, or Ministry of Finance, and not with the Trust. They then referred to a series of letters, page 30, The conduct of the defendant at the time of the signature --

2	p2,01:29:29.610,01:33:37.730,spk_1,	True	The Court: Are they all in the bundle? Counsel: I believe they're all, and I think they were only an example. The Court: Yes, right. Counsel: It is the defendant that decided to delegate to the Trust, the finalisation, signature, and implementation of the Agreement with the claimant, which the defendant and negotiated pursuant the MOU of July 1995, which appeared to be the main purpose for the establishment of the Trust. It said, It was signed by the Minister of Religious affairs, acting as chairman of the board. It refers to the successive promulgations. At 9(2) the defendant was contractually involved in the Agreement as the Government was bound under Article 2 to give its guarantee for the financial facility to be raised. The point I made earlier, that the guarantee was not a guarantee of its performance, but it was the trigger to enable the finance and the whole contract to begin. And at Article 27 of the Agreement, It was authorised to assign its rights and obligations to the Government, i.e. to the defendant, without the prior approval of the claimant. Such a clause is normally used only when the assignee is very closely linked to the assignor or is under its total control through ownership, management, or otherwise. Then the period of performance, During the lifetime of the Agreement, the defendant continued to handle matters relating to the Agreement signed by the Trust and to act to conduct itself in a way that confirmed that it regarded the Agreement as its own. And then it deals with beside the exercise of the regulatory powers, undertake -- officials of the defendant continue to be actively involved in the implementation of the Agreement, as they were previously in negotiation. Refers to the two letters of 26th of September 1996, and 4th of November, that was, those were the two letters I showed you relating to the implementation of rules for the funds which had been set up, and it's right that they had in fact been set up by the Trust. And it then, at 10(2), although the Trust enjoyed, under the Ordinance, legal and financial independence and capacity to own property and assets, and to dispose thereof it does not appear from the actual facts, as submitted by the parties, that the Trust effectively had any funds or assets of its own during its short lifetime, there's no evidence of any schemes or plans made to raise funds and to mobilise pilgrim's savings, nor of any transactions made and implemented by the Trust for the purpose of generating funds to finance its activities. Apparently, it seems as if the only activity conducted by the Trust was the signature of the Agreement with the claimant, with the implementation being followed up by the Ministry of Religious Affairs itself and as if the Trust was not given the human and financial means that could have enabled it to exercise fully its functions as an autonomous legal entity, and has therefore remained as an empty shell with all effective powers being exercised by the defendant itself. It was the Government which decided by a discretionary act or omission not to remit, promulgate the Ordinance, the end of four months from the date of its second re-promulgation, and therefore to put an end to the Trust on the 12th of December 1996 pursuant to the repeal of the Ordinance as a result of its non re-promulgation. The very existence of the Trust appears thus been depending merely on an attitude of non-action by the Government, demonstrating the fragile existence of the Trust, and it's complete dependability upon the Government, even for its own life. And then it refers to the letter of January 1997, and summarises the letter in the first paragraph on page 32. The second paragraph, such letter is very significant because it confirmed, in the clearest way possible, that the defendant, after the elapse of the Trust, regarded the Agreement with the claimant as its own and considered itself as a party to such agreement and, as such, was entitled to exercise all rights and assume more responsibilities provided for under such agreement.

2	p1,00:41:37.860,00:46:08.460,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And so we really now come, actually, I think that is the next document I need to take you to. We can skip all the leases, et cetera, and the next well, the next relevant document. Perhaps just passing through is, page 86 because in September, an associate company of the appellant purchased the land and in November transferred it to Dallah. That becomes relevant later. But the next document is the ordinance, which is page 93 and that's dated the 31st of January. And the recycle, if I may just spend a few moments on this, whereas it is expedient to provide for the establishment of a trust to mobilise savings from the pilgrims, desirous of performing Hajj and investment thereof in the Islamic modes of investment and for facilitating harsh operations and matters connected there with an incidental there too. And whereas the National Assembly is not in session, the President satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate action. So you will see the two purposes are one Islamic modes of investment and secondly, facilitating Hajj. And then over the page, you will see the definitions. And if I can just draw your attention in particular to Little E, managing trustee means the secretary, religious affairs division, government of Pakistan or such other person of integrity have a good record, et cetera, as the federal government may appoint to perform the functions of the managing trustee Trustee Bank means a bank or financial institution appointed by the board to collect deposits from members, maintain their accounts in the fund and make investment thereof in accordance with the direction of the board. And three is important because it appears in the agreement establishment of the trust as soon as may be, after the commencement of this ordinance, the federal government shell by notification in the Official Gazette, established a trust known as the Awami Hajj Trust. It will be a body corporate, having perpetual succession and a common seal with part to acquire, hold and dispose of property and made by its name, sue and be sued. The headquarters of the trust will be at Islamabad, and it may establish its regional offices in such other places as the federal government may be determined, and then you see the purposes and objects of the trust is to mobilise the savings and to invest the savings, defray the expenses and adopt measures for facilitating the performance of Hajj. And then you see the board of trustees. Not all but the majority are members of the government. The chairman of the Pakistan Banking Counsel, for example, is not. There are a considerable number. And then at 52, which is important, the secretary, Religious Affairs division government of Pakistan shall act as secretary of the board that becomes relevant later. So he wears two hats, once the trust comes into existence and then you have the powers and the functions and the powers and functions of the managing trustee. I'm not sure much turns on that. Page 97.10. The fund, Fund of the Trust, to be known as the Savings and Investment Trust and should be maintained by the Trustee Bank and it should be financed by the following sources. Contributions and savings by the members, contributions by philanthropists for the welfare of hajj profits, earning and capital gains from the investments made out of savings of members and income from movable and immovable properties of the trust and then 11 reports. The managing trustee shall by the end of each financial year is when the factual government may direct submit annual audited report of the fund to the board and such other reports about its activities as the board or the federal government may direct. And then the board may, with the prior approval of the federal government, make rules for carrying out the purpose of this ordinance.
2	p3,00:57:24.170,00:58:06.460,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The legal effect of the letter of Lutfullah Mufti Secretary of Ministry of Religious Affairs. Admittedly, the Trust laps on 12th December 1996. Thus, Trust established under the ordinance ceased to exist with effect 12th December 1996 and all of its office bearers, including the secretary of the Board of Trust I, secretary of Ministry of Religious Affairs, also ceased to have any authority to act for and on behalf of the Trust. The letter, dated the 19th of January 1997 written by the Secretary Ministry of Religious Affairs and addressed to the claimant, was therefore absolutely unauthorised, illegal and of no effect.
2	p1,00:29:54.050,00:33:52.600,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It's useful just to see this because this is at the start of the story and it's written to His Excellency Ministry for Hajj. We're taking the opportunity to write, to you about a very special situation has arisen in Saudi Arabia, which will prove to be an enormous benefit for the government and the people of Pakistan. He then goes on to say the king of Saudi Arabia and the custodian of the holy places has given the task of maintenance to the Dallah Albaraka group and due to this, we've been closely involved in the development and expansion of the holy cities. As part of this development, new regulations coming into effect, the group has been allowed to offer to selected Muslim governments housing complexes in Mecca and Medina for 55 year leases. As you maybe aware, the government of Pakistan rents housing in Mecca each year for the Hajj, and every year there's a problem. The acquisition of these sites will eliminate this problem for a period of 55 years would also result in considerable cost savings for the government of Pakistan and therefore they make the proposal. And in the end, last paragraph in closing, We'd like to add it's a unique opportunity for Pakistan and we hope we'll be able to assist more Pakistan Muslims in performing their religious obligations and earn the blessing of God Almighty. And then they asked to make a detailed presentation. So that's how it starts and we without taking you through all the documents. It's quite clear both from the documentary evidence and from the statement of Mr Naqvi that senior members of the government and ministers. As I said from the prime minister downwards, the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance were all involved throughout the whole project and the government's approval was required at every step of the way and in relation to every aspect of the deal. Its approval was required in relation to the least and the financial plan. The Pakistani ambassador viewed the potential for sites in Mecca and the government had input into the site chosen. The detailed specifications and drawings were approved by the government and even after the agreement to which the government was not a signatory, had been signed, Mr Naqvi explains that all his dealings were with members of the government. Now the structure of the deal, as evidence of by the agreement arose because it was a means whereby the government could finance the project consistently with Islamic principles. And the ultimate structure was an Islamic finance lease because, as you know, under Islamic principles, you can't claimed interest. And it enabled also the government to obtain dollars outside Pakistan at a time when its currency had devalued by approximately 15% and there were foreign exchange issues, so that's what underlined it. And the essence of the deal in our submission didn't change. It was simply the manner in which it was to be fine. Mr. Naqvi explains that there were two options. Either the government could divert its own borrowed funds, or Dallah could raise funds by way of a facility backed by a government guarantee. And you see, that real note is paragraph 46 of Mr Nafis witness statements. So we now come to the first agreement, which is the memorandum of understanding, and that is dated. Perhaps I just before I do that. Let me just take you to, Page 19 as an example of what I was saying, which is a letter of the 15th of July 1995, Financing proposal hajj housing.

This is after the trust has come into existence, and it says further to our various discussions, I'm pleased to set forth below the implementation schedule covering the provision of pilgrims housing in Mecca. And there, then there are proposals set forward, and if you go over the page payment plans, we are proposing two options by which the government could take these buildings from us and the first stop, the following agreed assumptions have been utilised in order to develop the payment plan and a number of the first plan. Number three a down payment of $100 million from the government of Pakistan has been assumed Dallah will arrange for the lane. So in the first option, the government itself is putting forward the money against alone. Then there's a plan A advanced rent plan B partial formulae, 12,000 pilgrims will be free for the government of Pakistan and the government of Pakistan will pay us 395 per pilgrim and then legal issues. In order to comply with the legal requirements of the various entities involved. The structure will be as follows the government to set up the trust Trust will borrow from Albaraka Trust will make the down payment trust will enter into the lease in order to provide the government maximum flexibility. We would propose that the government retained the following two options. The government has the right for a period of five years to develop housing on the remaining land, and the government has a right to buy the least outright during the 1st 10 years at a price of 345 million, minus the event already paid. So you will see then it is clearly the negotiations with the government. The structure will involve the trust and one sees that again at page 115 moving along in the year.

The introduction is made the 10th of September, and it refers to the trust established as you would have seen earlier under Section 3 of the ordinance with its registered office, is that Islamabad and Dallah my clients and the introduction says the trust is interesting in leasing reliable housing facilities and whereas Dallah owns adequate, appropriate real estate and the Clause 1 is the obligation of Dallah to develop and construct the necessary accommodation. Clause 2 is important. The total least value of the land area of 22,000 square metres and the total construction cost of the housing it is computed at respectively. 210 million, 135 million aggregating $345 million out of which the trust shall pay a lump sum of $100 million to Dallah by way of advanced lease payment within 30 days from the date of the execution of this agreement by the parties subject to Dallah arranging through one of its affiliates a U. S dollar 100 million financing facility for the Trust against a guarantee of the Government of Pakistan Dallah submitting it to the trust performance put Bond and then a counter guarantee issued by the Trust and Al Baraka Investment appointed by the Board of Trustees in favour of the government of Pakistan. So, in order for this to get on the off the ground, the trust has no money. It borrows the money from Dallah but before Dallah is prepared to lend the money it has to have a guarantee from the government.
3	p1,00:05:55.910,00:08:20.215,spk_0,	True	Counsel: That was the only point I was making at the stage. My Lord, as Your Lordship knows, but just for the benefit, perhaps, of those behind us. The case concerns enforcement of a unanimous ICC arbitration award rendered in Paris by an eminent international tribunal, comprising Lord Michael Mustill, Dr Nassim Hasan Shah, former chief justice of Pakistan, and Dr Ghaleb Mahmassani, who's a Lebanese lawyer who was the chair. In 1995, Dallah, my clients proposed to the government of Pakistan the idea of providing housing in Mecca for pilgrims performing harsh. This in due course led to a memorandum of understanding on the 24th of July 1995 made between Dallah and the government and later on the 10th of September 1996 to the agreement the subject matter of this appeal. The agreement was on its face, stated to be made between Dallah and the trust, a state entity, the respondent. The government of Pakistan was not a signatory to the agreement, nor was it named as a party. Had it been, we would not be here today, the first issue before the tribunal and the focus of the English proceedings concerned whether or not the government was a party to the arbitration clause. In that agreement, the tribunal found on the law and on the facts that it was. It subsequently found the government to be a party to the underlying agreement and in Dallah's favour on liability and awarded it 18,000,900,7000 odd dollars in damages. Together with costs, the government did not waive jurisdiction before the arbitral tribunal and has asserted sovereign immunity. If, however, it is found to be a party to the arbitration agreement, it is deemed by virtue of Section 9 of the State Immunity at 1978 to have waived its immunity in relation to the arbitration proceedings that is different from enforcement against assets. Yes, Dallah obtained leave to enforce the award as a judgement of the English court. This was challenged by the government under Section 103(2)(b) of the 1996. This basis of the challenge being that it is not valid under the law to which the parties subjected it or failing any indication thereon under the law of the country where the award was made.
3	p5,00:04:49.890,00:06:46.890,spk_0,	True	Counsel: They belie the case that Dallah's putting that somehow this was an admission by the government because it records firstly in paragraph 2 that the trust has lapsed because of exercise of paragraph 89 of the Pakistan Constitution. The four month period had passed, so they record, firstly, that the trust has gone. And then in paragraph 14 of the complaint, the government states that -- sorry that it records its 1997 proceedings that were brought by the trust. And then it records what the judge said, which is that actually, this is a claim that should be brought could be brought in the name of the government because the trust had gone. And the reason I stressed those paragraph's is that again, that's an indication of what the government was intending in 1998. Not that it's now agreed it was a party, but it was taking up this invitation from the judge. Those 1998 proceedings are very significant for Dallah's case, as Your Lordships will be aware, because they put their focus on the latter part of the chronology accepting they have difficulties with the MOU and the agreement, they say, Well, look what happened afterwards through the French test. So the 98 proceedings are important, but these are they were short lived. They were only alive for six months, which is short in the scheme of Pakistan legal proceedings. They were then withdrawn. In my submission, you can take a fair view as to why they were instituted because there was a knee jerk reaction to the ICC arbitration and because a judge had just told the government that they could actually commence proceedings. They were withdrawn in January 1999 on or about 14th, 14th of January. The reference for that the court order is bundle e tab b.10 page 47. On the same day that the 98 proceedings were withdrawn, the third set of proceedings were commenced by the government. These are the 1999 Pakistan regime's.

And this is from Walter Martin [inaudible] acting for the Government, Your attention is invited to your notice at the 29th of May, in respect of the above matter where our client is required to file its answer to the request for arbitration within 30 days. We wish to bring to your notice that our client has filed legal proceedings in Pakistan, which are pending in the court of Civil Judge First Class Islamabad and are fixed for hearing on the 13th of June 1998. The learner Judge has been pleased to grant an interim injunction pertaining to the dispute. Copy of the court order is attached for your information. And then draw attention to Section 35 of the Arbitration Act, No reference or award shall be rendered invalid by reason only the commencement of legal proceedings on the subject matter of reference, but when legal proceedings on the whole of the subject matter of the reference has been commenced between all parties to the reference, notice there are the arbitrator or umpire, all further proceedings in a pending reference shall, unless estoppel proceedings is granted, under Section 34 be invalid. In this section, the expression, parties to the reference, including any person claiming under any of the parties and litigating under the same title. And the point that, perhaps, is obvious in which the Tribunal made from this is of course, this is the first response to the request. It nowhere says that the respondent is not a party to the Agreement. What it says is we now have an injunction obtained, as it was, without notice from the Government, please do not go on with the arbitration. The next document is the next page, which is the 15th of August. The same lawyers also to the ICC, referring to two further notices, We wish to bring your kind notice that our client has already declined to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Arbitration. It may also be brought into your kind notice that our client does not and shall not submit to the jurisdiction of the ICC. Inter alia the following reasons. There's no contract or arbitration agreement between our parents and Dallah. The contract and arbitration agreement referred to by the claimant were entered into by the claimant, and the Trust. The Trust has already ceased to exist after expiry of the Ordinance. Clause 27 of the contract provides that the Trust may assign or transfer its rights and obligations to the Government without the prior consent in writing of Dallah. The Trust never assigned or transferred its rights and obligations. Contract was entered into and executed in Pakistan and under well established principles of law it's governed by the laws of Pakistan, hence the Arbitration Act is not applicable. Any award passed by the ICC will not be enforceable, being against the public policy and laws of Pakistan. Under Pakistan law, the application of the Protocol on Arbitration Clause's is limited to contracts which are considered as commercial under the law enforced in Pakistan. The contract in question was entered into for religious purposes to provide housing facilities to Pakistan pilgrims. Therefore, the laws of Pakistan don't recognise the protocol and arbitration clause's. Our client never agreed to make a submission to arbitration, and unilateral submission to arbitration by the claimant alone doesn't constitute actual submissions under the laws enforced in Pakistan.

This agreement should be settled by arbitration held under the ICC rules by three arbitrators in Paris by three arbitrators appointed under rules. And then you have an immunity clause waiver of immunity and you will see that the last two sentences appear to be in this one. It's the same as the last clause, but added after whether or not claimed, trust hereby irrevocably agrees not to claim and hereby irrevocably waived such immunity to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction. 25, trust waives any objection now here after the sighting of the venue of the arbitration 26 deals with enforcement. 27. The trust may assign or transfer rights and obligations under this agreement to the government of Pakistan without the prior consent. In writing of Dallah and then over the page, you have Mr Kadwai, the managing trustee of the trust and also at this time secretary of MORA, who signs on behalf of the trust.

But at the same time, the court must not lose sight of the fact that Dallah is, the Governor of Pakistan is making its position crystal clear in the arbitration itself. It's not a party while the 1998 proceedings are on foot. So I couldn't look at the 1998 proceedings without also taking into account what they were saying to the alleged tribunal.

And then it deals with the Pakistan proceedings, if I go to 12, And the aforementioned close scrutiny of all the factual elements relating to the conduct of the defendant with regard to the negotiation, signature, implementation, and termination of the agreement as well as with regard to the establishment operation expiry of the Trust, it is clearly established that the Trust established by the defendant was assigned an object, formed part of the functions of the defendant, was organically and operationally under the strict control of defendant, moreover its financial and administrative dependence was largely theoretical because it didn't have any funds or assets of its own. And as all that concerned the Agreement with the claimant whether before or after signature, continued to be performed by the defendant concurrently with the Trust. Following the lapse of the Trust, the Trust functions that were originally discharged by the defendant, reverted back logically to this letter with all rights and obligations of the defunct Trust. The Trust, in spite of its distinct [inaudible] personality in theory, appears thus in fact and in conduct to have been considered to have acted as part of the division of the defendant to which it is fully assimilated. The temporary instrument has been created by a political decision of the defendant, the specific activities which the defendant wanted to perform and which was cancelled also by a political decision of the defendant. Therefore, the Trust seems to appear -- now this is the alter ego point -- have been no more than the alter ego of the defendant, which appears in substance as the real party and interest and therefore as the proper party to the agreement and the arbitration with the claimant.

4	p2,00:27:57.940,00:31:29.300,spk_1,	True	Counsel: In the document that you're looking at, there is reference to the letter -- to the request for arbitration. The request for arbitration is clearly made against the Government and not against the Trust. The Court: Yep. Counsel: And what I'm saying is the sequences application following the letter of the 2016 January, which I'll come to in a second, where we had told the Government in response to their letter of the 20th --19th of January, we would issue proceedings. We did issue proceedings at the ICC against the Government. It was served on the Government. When the Government received it, they went off to the court having done nothing in the last three months and started the proceedings all over again. But this -- but they didn't mention, because it was an ex parte application, that in the interim they had actually received arbitration proceedings against them. We then come back in on notice and raise this point and that's where this comes. And the point being, again, that in order to fund these proceedings, because the proceedings could not -- it wasn't a cause of action without -- the letter was integral, and the contents of the letter were integral to the plaint in both the first, 1997 on the second, 1998. And what this does, at the very least, is that it cast doubt on what was going through the mind of Mr Lutfullah Mufti in 1997 which the judge places so much reliance upon. Because here's the same gentleman, now in a different scenario, saying something completely different. And we say, realistically, you cannot place all this weight on what happened in 1997. You have to look at it in the round. And it's not -- just as my learned friend without any evidence, tries to say, as I think Lord Clarke, it may be Lord Mance had said, Well, maybe Mr Lutfullah Mufti made a mistake. The same, you can also say, but here's a government, in effect taking, using legal action tactically to ensure belt and braces that now having made sure that the Trust isn't a party, wants to make quite sure that Dallah, who, after all, are chasing them and responded in the subsequently in the letter to the Government to get on with it, don't try and make life difficult for the Government. And the easiest way is really a declaration of non-justiciability or whatever to say that's the end of it. And the Pakistan courts would then, they hope, say that there wasn't a contract and the Government would then be clear of it. The Court: Yes. So, we say, therefore, that the 1997 proceedings cannot be as cast iron as Mr Justice Akin said. You have to, under the French test, look at the whole scenario. You can't stop in 1997. You will have to go on to 1998. Well, there will come a point where you stop.

Defendant filed application under Section 3, read with Section 34 Arbitration Act, seeking a stay on the ground that under Clause 23 of the Agreement, the dispute arising out of the Agreement is liable to be settled by arbitration by the ICC in Paris and under Clause 25, Trust has wave objections, sighting of the venue. They further submitted the defendant already filed his claim in the ICC and notice to that this effect has been served on the plaintiff i.e. the Government. The plaintiff respondent contested the application, it was submitted to exist no valid and effective agreement between the parties and that the proceedings initiated by the defendant in the ICC are against the Ministry of Religious Affairs and not against the Government of Pakistan. It was further submitted, that process, if any, was issued in the name of Ministry of Religious Affairs and not the present plaintiff. Just pausing that, to add to that, when we come to look at what happened in the ICC, you will see that one of the points the Tribunal picked up on was that in the initial stages, really, Lord Saville's point, it wasn't actually stated that the arbitration was again -- should not be proceeded against the Government. All that was served on the ICC was the injunction, asking the ICC not to proceed with the arbitration. 
4	p6,00:57:40.060,00:58:45.920,spk_3,	True	Counsel: By a letter dated the 19th of January 1997 -- The Court: I'm so sorry which tab are you in? Counsel: Tab 11. The Court: Tab 11. Counsel: The government of Pakistan informed Dallah that it was in repudiatory breach of the agreement, having failed to submit specifications and drawings within 90 days and notified Dallah that the repudiation was accepted by the government of Pakistan also notified Dallah that its failure to arrange a financing facility within 30 days prevented the agreement from becoming effective in any event. Dallah denied the government of Pakistan's allegations and in turn accused the government of Pakistan of breach of contract. This was in support of the opposition to the leave to enforce on the basis that the government was never a party to the agreement. Nonetheless, in that witness statement, it says that the government of Pakistan, not the trust, informed Dallah and that was dated the 23rd of March 2007. Some 16 months later, we get a second witness statement at Paragraph 12 tab 12 page 159.

And it's not the successor of the trust that there's no privity of contract now. In my submission, what's relevant here, as was found by Mr Justice Aikens and the Court of Appeal is if you, as you have to do through French eyes, look at the full chronology from beginning to end, you've got the 1998 proceedings sandwiched between, it's a short period of time, sandwiched between 97 where it's the trust bringing a claim and then 99 where the government is saying we're not a party to any of this. If you take a reasonable fair view of that, you can't take that six month period, in my submission, as being an admission by the government that it is a party to the arbitration agreement. If nothing else, one can see reasonably why they acted in that way because the judge gave them a false lead, but also through French eyes. The test is whether it's subjective or objective. Were they -- are they to be taken as having accepted an arbitration clause. Well, in my submission, starting a court proceeding is a curious way of accepting an arbitration clause.

And so again, if you go to flag B1, you see the plaintiff name changes. At paragraph 1, the Trust was a body corporate the Secretary of Religious Affairs government of Pakistan was the Secretary constituted under Section 5. Then 2, that under Article 89 the aforesaid Ordinance stood lapse on expiry of four months from the date of its promulgation. As such, the Trust established no longer remained in field. The present suit is, therefore, being filed by Pakistan who issued the said Ordinance. And then if you jump to 6, The parties, the party now, of course, being the Government, entered into an agreement dated the 10th of September at Islamabad. 7, to be effective as from the date, the defendant receives, again, the advanced lease payment from the Trust and submits the requisite performance bond in the terms of the Agreement. But as per Clause 2, and you can see it's a scissors and paste job, the plaintiff Trust was required to pay a lump sum. 9, that the payment of the above mentioned advanced by the plaintiff i.e. the GOP not the plaintiff Trust in this case. But if you jump to 11, it's perhaps the clearest. Under Clause 4 of the Agreement, the defendant was also under an obligation to submit detailed specifications and drawings of the Makkah housing project, but the defendant complied -- failed to comply with this fundamental term of the Agreement which tantamount to a repudiation of the whole agreement which repudiation was accordingly accepted by the plaintiff. On this case, the plaintiff is the Government in its letter of the 19th of January 1997, and that on account of the repudiation of the Agreement, the same is no longer binding on the plaintiff, the Government, and the defendant is not entitled to raise any claim. And in 14, that in January 1997 refers to the Trust instituting a suit was, however, dismissed the order of the 24th of February, and sets out the grounds, and then over the page, The learned Civil Court observed, however, that liabilities and duties against the defendant can be agitated by the Government of Pakistan. That the cause of action accrued to the plaintiff against the defendant at Islamabad. Firstly, when the defendant, the Government, entered into the Agreement and thereafter when it defaulted in fulfilling the preconditions of the agreement, and the same was repudiated.

Let me, I think it probably is just quicker if I take you to a couple of documents to support it, the first is, I think is cited in, the first is cited from the joint report, joint memoranda, I needn't to take you to that. If I take you to B(1), for example.
5	p6,00:34:25.280,00:35:19.480,spk_3,	True	Counsel: Well established as a basic legal rule of the international law of arbitration, international arbitration agreements are autonomous, and that such autonomy means on the one hand the Arbitration agreement is separable from the main contract which relates and that its existence and validity are to be determined on the basis of its own terms. And then if you go, for example, to Paragraph 3, where we have a further reference to the French test judicial as well as arbitral case law now clearly recognised that as a result of the principle of autonomy, the rules of law applicable to an arbitration agreement may differ from those governing the main contract. Such rules need not be linked to a particular national law, and they refer to Dalico but may consist of those transnational general principles. 
5	p5,00:49:25.630,00:50:06.850,spk_0,	True	Counsel: When we got to this, because we were looking at trying to understand the tribunal's award. Can I with your permission can I just wind back to that point? Where we end up is that in my submission, what the tribunal has done is they have applied transnational rules, not French law, and they have conducted an exercise. The important this is the important point. They've conducted an exercise which is not open to a court under Article five of the New York Convention. It may be open to the tribunal sitting in France as arbitrators, but it is not open under the conflict of law rules in Article 5(1)(a) of the New York convention and equally section 1032 of the 1996 Act.
5	p2,00:54:12.850,00:54:44.710,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The main agreement will be determined according to Saudi law, so you have perhaps a case which is not uncommon but perhaps unusual where the arbitration agreement is determined by a different law from the main agreement. The second point is that the relevant article under the New York Convention provides, in this case, that the relevant law is the law in the country where the award was made. I conceded, as it appears to be the prevailing view was supported amongst others by Albert Vandenberg in his treatise, that this means that substantive law rather than the conflicts of rules law in France.

5	p5,01:21:09.110,01:21:44.120,spk_0,	True	Counsel: French courts adopted this idea of not using conflicts, going straight to what they say is transnational law to test the validity of an arbitration agreement. Since then, that principle has been refined and developed by the French courts. And that's why what in volume B(1) you've got a number of French decisions showing how the rule has been developed by the French courts. The French may still call this transnational law. Analytically it is French law.
5	p5,01:09:17.870,01:10:02.880,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Number one, French law. That is the law that will be applied by French courts, absent any other agreement. Number two, the conflicts rules that apply to arbitrators sitting in France. What are they allowed to do? Number three, general transnational law that arbitrators may be able to apply sitting in France by virtue of number two, the conflicts rules.

5	p2,01:01:19.710,01:03:07.520,spk_1,	True	Counsel: If you start at page 67, application of the substantive rules method by courts reviewing arbitral awards, Generally speaking, the circumstances in which the French courts will examine the validity of an arbitration agreement are fairly limited as a result of the kompetenz-kompetenz principle, on the limited grounds on which an award can be set aside or refused of enforcement. The issue will arise where parties petition for an award to be set aside or enforced, and where it is alleged that either the award was made in the absence of an agreement, on the basis of an arbitration agreement was void or had expired, or the arbitral tribunal declined jurisdiction after wrongly deciding that an arbitration agreement was non existent or invalid. It was in this context that the court held that the existence and effectiveness of the arbitration agreement would only be scrutinised in the light of the requirements of international public policy to use the expression coined by the Paris Court's of Appeals. We've seen that the criticism levelled against these decisions was prompted by the court's use of unfortunate terminology regarding the arbitration agreements own effectiveness and was particularly concerned that the practical and theoretical impossibility of basing the validity of the contract on no law at all. The criticism is unfounded however, in French case law the intention is not to remove the arbitration agreement from all forms of control. It is instead to restrict such control to review of the arbitration agreement in the light of the French conception of fundamental requirements of justice in international commerce, referred to by the French courts as international public policy. Although the goal is not to avoid the application of the law otherwise competent, the expression international public policy is well chosen where the decision to be taken is whether or not a dispute is arbitrable, an issue falling with the scope of --

5	p2,00:57:04.950,00:57:32.550,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Well it's because of that, and because of what French law says, because what is said is that because I have agreed that the law by which this arbitration clause has to be determined is French law, when the tribunal were looking at it, they were determining the issue albeit the common intention is the same in both, by a different law. And therefore you can't say that they were carrying out the same exercise.
5	p5,01:10:06.160,01:10:55.770,spk_0,	True	Counsel: That is the clear, that's the very important distinction in order to understand this area. So the first category is French law, as applied by French court's. Categories two and three is about French arbitrators or arbitrators sitting in France. We shouldn't be concerned with two and three because for your purposes you've got to understand you've got to apply French law under Article 5(1)(a) of the New York Convention. You'll recall that whether you need to turn that up again, but that's a uniform conflicts rule in the Convention. Maybe it's worth just starting from that point again. Bundle, the authorities bundle 1 New York Convention, tab 12. This, of course, is the same wording at the 1996 Act.
5	p5,00:34:00.590,00:35:28.640,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And what's also curious, My Lords, if I may refer you back to page 20 -- internal page 20 of the award, paragraph 3. When the tribunal articulates the principles that they're going to apply, they talk about in paragraph 3, Rules of law. They say judicial as well as arbitral case law. Now arbitral case law is a shorthand for Dow Chemical. In my submission, the Dow Chemical I don't know if Your Lordships are familiar with it, but it is an ICC arbitral award that has given rise to what's been called arbitral case law on something called the Groups of Company doctrine, which has come before the English courts occasionally and been roundly rejected. But arbitral case law is not French law. Previous decisions of arbitrators, they say here, arbitral case law now clearly recognise that as a result of the principle of autonomy, the rules of law applicable to an arbitration agreement may differ, then just is a reference to Dalico. And then it says 300 bottom, May consist of transnational general principles, which the arbitrators would consider to meet the fundamental requirements of justice. Then, it says, Dr Justice Shah and Lord Mustill would not endorse without reservation the concept of a transnational procedural law independent of all national laws. They need not, however, pursue this, since it makes no difference to the results now in my submission, that's difficult to understand. Why does it make no difference to the result?

So, My Lord, before I do that though, I would just like to reiterate briefly the French test, which I said in a sentence a moment ago. For your note, the summary of French law is set out in paragraph 49 of our case at pages 20, starts at paragraph 49, pages 22 to 25 a more detailed exposition is that paragraphs 85 to 96 of Mr Justice Aiken's judgement. But if I can just paraphrase it and I hope there is a little between us on this, essentially in order to determine whether an arbitration clause upon which the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal is founded extends to a personal party who is neither a named party nor a signatory to the underlying agreement containing that clause, it's necessary to ascertain whether all the parties to the arbitration proceedings had the common intention, whether express or implied, to be bound by the agreement and hence the arbitration agreement. Or, to put it another way, that the non signatory was aware of the arbitration clause and accepted its terms. Under French law, this common intention is determined in the light of the facts of the case, starting at the beginning of the chronology and going on to the end looking at the facts in the round, including considering the involvement and behaviour of all the parties during the negotiation, performance and, if applicable, termination of the underlying agreement, and the court seeks to ascertain the subjective intentions of the parties through their objective conduct. In other words, if you behave as a party, that is objective, an objective piece of conduct that can be deemed to indicate that you intended to be a party.
5	p5,01:40:15.220,01:41:03.620,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Having recited the case law, which is partly in Bundle B(1), my visual exhibit that was before Aikens, can say the result of this case law is that the arbitration agreement is subjected to a material rule in contrast to conflicts principle, which recognises its validity, provided it does not violate international public policy. Although this has been the subject of controversy, the rule is an international rule of French law and not a transnational rule. He cites there to a influential note by professor Peter Maier, who is a leading French academic in arbitration law. That article is in French and English in the previous tab, tab 3.
5	p5,00:37:47.450,00:38:21.180,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Because the French or in arbitrators sitting in France, they are entitled by conflicts of law to treat the arbitration agreement as governed by transnational principles. Because of the nature of the arbitration agreement. It is an agreement which has validity by reference to a transnational legal order different from other contracts. That's a conception of arbitration that we do not have in England, but they do have in in some civil law countries. So there are French rules which allow them to do that for the arbitration clause.

It is, in fact, a rule of French law that the Court of Appeals states and applies to the clause at the same time, although it reserves the affirmation of the principle of intrinsic validity of the clause to other hypotheses, as we'll see later, such a principle is no less implied.
5	p6,00:22:05.110,00:23:34.860,spk_3,	True	Counsel: A distinction was made between what the French courts would do and what an arbitral panel sitting in France would do. But what we're looking at here is what the French courts would do when considering what an arbitral panel sitting in France would do. And therefore, in our submission, it's a distinction without a difference, because what you're looking at is what the French courts were doing, in effect, what the French court will do in France when the contemporaneous enforcement proceedings are determined. And the expert evidence was agreed between the two experts, the transnational law was a part of French law, and I've taken you to the joint memorandum. It was also agreed, and it was put to both witnesses that good faith is a part of French law and a reference, for example, of M. Vatier, because it's only two sentences, I asked him, Did good faith form a part of French law? And he said, Yes. It's B, tab 5, page 104. I don't think we need to turn it up, but importantly, you will recall yesterday, and I don't want to take you to it again, but I put to M. Vatier, who is the government's witness, Paragraph 6 of the tribunal's award.

But in that common, if contrary to your case on the facts that were held that there was a common intention that the government should be a party to the contract and thus to the arbitration clause since no line had really been drawn between being a party to the contract and a party to the arbitration agreement, then that would be enough for French law.
6	p5,02:14:43.340,02:16:24.770,spk_0,	True	Counsel: There was evidence before Mr Justice Aikens that the French law test is to be applied in concreto. Meaning that you have to look at the apply it realistically to the particular facts that particular parties and in this case that meant a state. There was a refinement, several refinements of the common intention test as a matter of French law, French transnational law when applying it to states, I can list these quickly. There was an acceptance by the French experts and by Mr Justice Aikens recorded in his judgment at paragraph 91 Mr Justice Aikens' judgment that you have to when applying this test bear in mind that as a matter of French law, the quarter concessional decision in Crichton and Qatar, a French state that agrees to an arbitration governed by French law in France, will be taken to have waived its sovereign immunity, not just with respect to jurisdiction, but also with respect to execution. Okay, now, that's the French Quarter final decision in France. They say that the ICC rules include a waiver of sovereign immunity, not just jurisdiction, but also execution against state assets. We haven't taken that view yet in this jurisdiction, but what was held in front of Mr Justice Aikens was that because of the importance of that, that is a factor to be taken into account when deciding whether or not the state really has agreed that.

Thus was confirmed the principle pursuant to which the validity of an arbitration clause in international contracts resulted solely from the will of the parties independently of any reference to the law of the main contract and to any national law. This is the ultimate pinnacle of autonomy, so that is what the French courts are doing.

Rather as Fouchard, Gaillard, Goldman noted, the result of a skid of terminology, which probably is an unfortunate translation for it is only the first two aspects ie indifference to the fate of the main contract and the possibility of being submitted to a separate law that flow logically from the principle of separability. The latter, by no means implies that the arbitration agreement is independent of any national law. The real justification of this regime lies elsewhere. Philippe Fouchard emphasises in his note on the Menicucci judgment, the aim is to remove the obstacles which certain laws, including French law, bring to the development of international arbitration. Although the judgment does not say so, this new conception of separability implies abandoning the conflicts of law approach in favour of material rules. Those are the [inaudible] material which I mentioned, which are, in reality, part of French law and not of any international or transnational system. We shall see this point with the Dalico judgment. That's the point, the French will call it transnational law because of its origin.

6	p5,01:17:53.530,01:19:03.590,spk_0,	True	Counsel: The French courts do not apply a conflicts of law analysis to the question of who is a party to an arbitration agreement or its validity. They have developed what in France is called a [inaudible] a substantive rule, material rule which the courts in France apply instead of going through a conflicts of law analysis. The origin of this substantive material rule is a transnational rule, a rule of international public policy and many other international norms. That's its origin. But the French and the French courts are proud of that, and that's why there's some sensitivity about this decision. They like to say, as they have done in Dalico. The Dalico is the main case on this, which is the one cited by the tribunal. They like to say we respect arbitration agreements as being above the level of national legal orders. They are special transnational agreements. We will test their validity by the French conception of international public policy.
6	p2,00:57:04.950,00:57:32.550,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Well it's because of that, and because of what French law says, because what is said is that because I have agreed that the law by which this arbitration clause has to be determined is French law, when the tribunal were looking at it, they were determining the issue or be it the common intention is the same boat, by a different law. And therefore you can't say that they were carrying out the same exercise.
6	p6,00:37:47.210,00:38:34.130,spk_3,	True	Counsel: Such common intention may be revealed by their behaviour at the time of negotiating during the performance and at the time of termination, and that's a group of company's issue. It's not a determining factor, as it is considered by the quarters of subsidiary Element. Last observation explains that in future decisions of the same effect, the Paris Court of Appeal was able to generalise this approach by constantly declaring an arbitration clause in an international contract. Validity and effectiveness of such as the clause must be extended to parties directly implicated in the performance of the contract and in any disputes arising out of the contract, provided that it has been established that their respective situations and activities raised the presumption that they were aware of the later case was a gloss.

And then if you go, for example, to Paragraph 3, where we have a further reference to the French test judicial as well as arbitral case law now clearly recognised that as a result of the principle of autonomy, the rules of law applicable to an arbitration agreement may differ from those governing the main contract. Such rules need not be linked to a particular national law, and they refer to Dalico but may consist of those transnational general principles.

And it's not the successor of the trust that there's no privity of contract now. In my submission, what's relevant here, as was found by Mr Justice Aikens and the Court of Appeal is if you, as you have to do through French eyes, look at the full chronology from beginning to end, you've got the 1998 proceedings sandwiched between, it's a short period of time, sandwiched between 97 where it's the trust bringing a claim and then 99 where the government is saying we're not a party to any of this. If you take a reasonable fair view of that, you can't take that six month period, in my submission, as being an admission by the government that it is a party to the arbitration agreement. If nothing else, one can see reasonably why they acted in that way because the judge gave them a false lead, but also through French eyes. The test is whether it's subjective or objective. Were they -- are they to be taken as having accepted an arbitration clause. Well, in my submission, starting a court proceeding is a curious way of accepting an arbitration clause.
7	p1,00:10:49.640,00:11:59.940,spk_0,	True	Counsel: But when you are looking at the common intention, one has to take away one's natural instinct as an English lawyer, and one looks at the test of the intention of the parties from the beginning to the end, looking at their behaviour objectively to determine the subjective intention and the purpose of taking you through it is to indicate well, first, the tribunal got it right. But if I am wrong in that to show that there were two that it was not this was a case where it was possible to give different interpretations, but primarily that when you were looking at the award, as we will do, and I will be asking to place emphasis on that, that, inherently, the tribunal got it right. And therefore, when you're looking at reviewing an award when you have a fully reasoned award, which on its face stands up, considerable weight ought to be given to that. And the English court should not be trying to reinterpret documents where there's no new, actual, no new evidence.
7	p5,00:12:34.390,00:13:02.480,spk_0,	True	Counsel: My Lord the point about the French test, which is set out most clearly in the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal in a case called Orri, which I will come to later in the context of transnational law, is the French test asks the question subjectively, Did the parties accept the arbitration clause. If a party is declaring in a proceeding, We are by operation of law, a successor. In my submission that is analytically distinct from it intending subjectively to be a party.
7	p4,00:41:30.590,00:42:25.940,spk_1,	True	Counsel: But as the evidence indicated, and as in fact, Mr Justice Aikens himself said, It's only one of the factors. And, in our submission, it should not be an overriding factor when looking at everything and every aspect of this case, because the government here were involved in a commercial deal and there is nothing, we would say, which should take it out of the ordinary realms of either the ordinary test of common intention or the ordinary nature of the review or, ultimately, the question of discretion. We would submit that in all the circumstances, this court should resolve the doubts in favour of the arbitration consistent with this court's previous decisions in Lesotho Highlands and Fiona Trust, where this court has given a strong message as to the importance of international arbitration.
7	p5,01:49:17.160,01:50:28.020,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Can I make this other point along the way it's set against me that Mr Justice Aikens was in no better position than the tribunal. There was no new evidence but the whole point of the three day hearing in front of Mr Justice Aikens was to have detailed analysis of the French test with live testimony from Dr [inaudible]. That was not before the tribunal and that's the point about who is a part of this arbitration. It's what it's the key, essential evidence, whether you call it evidence or submission. It's French law that was not put before the tribunal. And there's a good reason for that because the case wasn't argued on that basis in front of the tribunal. It was argued as alter ego and succession. The first time the issue of common intent or the French test was raised was after the end of the hearings in the arbitration, in a letter written by the chairman, Mr Mahmassani, to the parties that's noted in the written case, the evidence had finished, the hearings were over. Mr Mahmassani says, The tribunal has been thinking about this and wonder whether, in addition to -- The Court: Do you have the letter?
7	p3,00:12:46.860,00:14:49.960,spk_2,	True	Counsel: I just really wanted to dispel what I think has become a point, which in a sense is not really critical to the submissions I make. I'm not taking you to the model law or the English or the French position as set out in the case just before finally, just want to make a few brief comments on the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdictions. Let me make it clear that we accept that the tribunal is not the final arbiter of its own jurisdiction. It is subject to review being described as by Gaillard Chronological review, and it can happen at various stages. It could happen by way of a preliminary ruling under Article 16(3) of the model law or Section 32 in this country. It can happen by way of setting aside, and it can happen at the enforcement stage. But there is an important, vital distinction to be made between the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction, which is the jurisdiction to determine whether or not that tribunal has substantive jurisdiction. In other words, to go on here in the merits and the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction itself. And the conclusion of an exercise of a kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction may be right, or it may be wrong. But that tribunal, pursuant to that kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction still in our submission has jurisdiction to make the wrong decision. I may be wrong, and it can be set aside or it can not be enforced. But it doesn't undermine the initial entitlement of the arbitrators to make that decision. And that decision again, even if right or wrong remains binding, it may not be enforced because it's wrong, but as a partial award in this case, it is a binding award because the convention recognises, as does the English statute, partial awards.

7	p2,00:57:04.950,00:57:32.550,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Well it's because of that, and because of what French law says, because what is said is that because I have agreed that the law by which this arbitration clause has to be determined is French law, when the tribunal were looking at it, they were determining the issue albeit the common intention is the same in both, by a different law. And therefore you can't say that they were carrying out the same exercise.

7	p6,00:22:05.110,00:23:34.860,spk_3,	True	Counsel: A distinction was made between what the French courts would do and what an arbitral panel sitting in France would do. But what we're looking at here is what the French courts would do when considering what an arbitral panel sitting in France would do. And therefore, in our submission, it's a distinction without a difference, because what you're looking at is what the French courts were doing, in effect, what the French court will do in France when the contemporaneous enforcement proceedings are determined. And the expert evidence was agreed between the two experts, the transnational law was a part of French law, and I've taken you to the joint memorandum. It was also agreed, and it was put to both witnesses that good faith is a part of French law and a reference, for example, of M. Vatier, because it's only two sentences, I asked him, Did good faith form a part of French law? And he said, Yes. It's B, tab 5, page 104. I don't think we need to turn it up, but importantly, you will recall yesterday, and I don't want to take you to it again, but I put to M. Vatier, who is the government's witness, Paragraph 6 of the tribunal's award. 
7	p1,00:12:08.460,00:14:05.850,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I will do my best. So, My Lord, before I do that though, I would just like to reiterate briefly the French test, which I said in a sentence a moment ago. For your note, the summary of French law is set out in paragraph 49 of our case at pages 20, starts at paragraph 49, pages 22 to 25 a more detailed exposition is that paragraphs 85 to 96 of Mr Justice Aikens’ judgment. But if I can just paraphrase it and I hope there is a little between us on this, essentially in order to determine whether an arbitration clause upon which the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal is founded extends to a personal party who is neither a named party nor a signatory to the underlying agreement containing that clause, it's necessary to ascertain whether all the parties to the arbitration proceedings had the common intention, whether express or implied, to be bound by the agreement and hence the arbitration agreement. Or, to put it another way, that the non signatory was aware of the arbitration clause and accepted its terms. Under French law, this common intention is determined in the light of the facts of the case, starting at the beginning of the chronology and going on to the end looking at the facts in the round, including considering the involvement and behaviour of all the parties during the negotiation, performance and, if applicable, termination of the underlying agreement, and the court seeks to ascertain the subjective intentions of the parties through their objective conduct. In other words, if you behave as a party, that is objective, an objective piece of conduct that can be deemed to indicate that you intended to be a party.
7	p4,00:46:34.360,00:47:28.180,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The French judge seeks the subjective intention, but he may deduce the subjective intention from objective behaviour. In arbitration cases the case law shows that the intention of the party subjected to arbitration may lead it to the liability of a party that was not a signatory to the arbitration, but in this case, the intention of the party and then Mr [inaudible] corrects it. The word is involvement. The involvement of a party that was not a signatory to the contract must be manifesting positive. So what that means is that the case law seeks through the objective conduct of the party its subjective intention. The assessment is indeed towards subjective intention, as can be seen in the case of the so called pyramid case where, although the Egyptian government was involved in the arbitration, the Court of Appeal judge that it has been its intention to submit to arbitration. Do you mean involved in the arbitration? Sorry.
7	p5,00:11:44.250,00:12:15.790,spk_2,	True	The Court: If there was a common, I know this is contrary to your case, if there was a common intention in that six month period, so that during that six month period, assuming there's never been a common intention up till -- up till then. But in that common, if contrary to your case on the facts that were held that there was a common intention that the government should be a party to the contract and thus to the arbitration clause since no line really been drawn between being a party to the contract and a party to the arbitration agreement, then that would be enough for French law.
7	p2,01:01:19.710,01:03:07.520,spk_1,	True	Counsel: If you start at page 67, application of the substantive rules method by courts reviewing arbitral awards, Generally speaking, the circumstances in which the French courts will examine the validity of an arbitration agreement are fairly limited as a result of the kompetenz-kompetenz principle, on the limited grounds on which an award can be set aside or refused of enforcement. The issue will arise where parties petition for an award to be set aside or enforced, and where it is alleged that either the award was made in the absence of an agreement, on the basis of an arbitration agreement was void or had expired, or the arbitral tribunal declined jurisdiction after wrongly deciding that an arbitration agreement was non existent or invalid. It was in this context that the court held that the existence and effectiveness of the arbitration agreement would only be scrutinised in the light of the requirements of international public policy to use the expression coined by the Paris Courts of Appeals. We've seen that the criticism levelled against these decisions was prompted by the court's use of unfortunate terminology regarding the arbitration agreements own effectiveness and was particularly concerned that the practical and theoretical impossibility of basing the validity of the contract on no law at all. The criticism is unfounded however, in French case law the intention is not to remove the arbitration agreement from all forms of control. It is instead to restrict such control to review of the arbitration agreement in the light of the French conception of fundamental requirements of justice in international commerce, referred to by the French courts as international public policy. Although the goal is not to avoid the application of the law otherwise competent, the expression international public policy is well chosen where the decision to be taken is whether or not a dispute is arbitrable, an issue falling with the scope of --
7	p3,00:25:53.080,00:26:40.850,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Because any consideration of the nature and extent of an enforcing court review, which is carried out according to its national procedures, must be able to accommodate a variety of potential situations which could come before it. Now in this case, we have a unanimous word from an experienced and eminent tribunal sitting in Paris under the auspices of the ICC producing a fully reasoned award scrutinised by the ICC under its Rules seat in a sophisticated country was a sophisticated jurisprudence where the respondent declined to participate at the oral hearings. Even without prejudice, it was perfectly entitled to do. But the tribunal nonetheless produced lengthy, and nonetheless their submissions were considered by the tribunal.

7	p1,00:15:59.370,00:16:41.390,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It's a question of what the parties, if by the government's behaviour it indicated that it intended to become a party to that agreement that under French law, in our submission, is sufficient. There was some cross-examination at the hearing because our expert witness indicated that there was perhaps something slightly different format of French law called adhesion. But under cross-examination he accepted that the test throughout was the question of common intention and the only difference would be as to when that party intended to become a party.
7	p5,02:14:43.340,02:16:24.770,spk_0,	True	Counsel: There was evidence before Mr Justice Aikens that the French law test is to be applied in concreto. Meaning that you have to look at the apply it realistically to the particular facts that particular parties and in this case that meant a state. There was a refinement, several refinements of the common intention test as a matter of French law, French transnational law when applying it to states, I can list these quickly. There was an acceptance by the French experts and by Mr Justice Aikens recorded in his judgment at paragraph 91 Mr Justice Aikens' judgment that you have to when applying this test bear in mind that as a matter of French law, the quarter concessional decision in Crichton and Qatar, a French state that agrees to an arbitration governed by French law in France, will be taken to have waived its sovereign immunity, not just with respect to jurisdiction, but also with respect to execution. Okay, now, that's the French Quarter final decision in France. They say that the ICC rules include a waiver of sovereign immunity, not just jurisdiction, but also execution against state assets. We haven't taken that view yet in this jurisdiction, but what was held in front of Mr Justice Aikens was that because of the importance of that, that is a factor to be taken into account when deciding whether or not the state really has agreed that.
8	p6,00:44:32.770,00:44:46.470,spk_5,	True	The Court: I follow that. But that's not the way the tribunal did it. They didn't say, Well, now, as at that moment, it's perfectly clear that the trust was to be the party that the government wasn't. But when you look at the whole picture, you'll see it was changed. They don't do that.
8	p4,01:21:53.810,01:23:08.350,spk_3,	True	The Court: Can I just take up one point, because one wouldn't want to say anything on it that was inappropriate for the future. But you've referred to the American distinction between arguments about the scope of an award and arguments about whether there was an arbitration agreement at all. I mean, I can see that if you've got an arbitration body, one would give particular attention to their view as to whether an issue was within their powers. But as a matter of logic, if an issue arose under Article 5(1)(c) as to whether the award dealt with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, as a matter of logic, it's difficult to see why the court's approach to that should be any different from its approach to question whether there is a valid arbitration agreement at all. And the issue is, essentially, whether there's a valid arbitration agreement covering what was decided, and that should be an issue which a party is entitled to come to court to argue and have decided, if a party hasn't submitted something to arbitration, then it hasn't submitted it.
8	p2,00:52:19.850,00:54:11.360,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Since none of these conditions was fulfilled by the claimant, the contract and the arbitration agreement never became effective or operative. Kindly take into account the above factors and reflect the claim as the same is not maintainable. However, this letter shall not in any way and manner deemed to constitute on the part of our client a submission and acquiescence to the proceedings. Nor have we any instructions from our client authorising us to join the proceeding or to represent it in any proceedings. And I think that for present purposes, is as far as I need to take you. And what I would like to do now with Your Lordship's permission is to take you, with that outline of the facts, to the tribunal's reasoning and the judge's reasoning. But before I do so, can I just make a few points. First of all, you will have seen from my learned friend's case that I have, perhaps, been roundly criticised for saying different things at different stages of the proceedings. My Lord, forensically, one often refines and changes one's submissions and I hope what I say today will be better and more persuasive than my submissions in the past. Let me make six brief points before I take you to the documents. First, before the tribunal, the parties argued, respectively, for Saudi law and Pakistan law. It was the tribunal which decided, as it was entitled to do as a tribunal with a French seat, to apply transnational law. And it ultimately agreed in relation to the main agreement, the arbitration agreement being separable, that the main agreement will be determined according to Saudi law. So, you have, perhaps, a case which is not uncommon, but a little unusual, where the arbitration agreement is determined by a different law from the main agreement.

8	p6,00:34:25.280,00:35:19.480,spk_3,	True	Counsel: Well established as a basic legal rule of the international law of arbitration, international arbitration agreements are autonomous, and that such autonomy means on the one hand the Arbitration agreement is separable from the main contract which relates and that its existence and validity are to be determined on the basis of its own terms. And then if you go, for example, to Paragraph 3, where we have a further reference to the French test judicial as well as arbitral case law now clearly recognised that as a result of the principle of autonomy, the rules of law applicable to an arbitration agreement may differ from those governing the main contract. Such rules need not be linked to a particular national law, and they refer to Dalico but may consist of those transnational general principles. 
8	p3,00:12:46.860,00:14:49.960,spk_2,	True	Counsel: I just really wanted to dispel what I think has become a point, which in a sense is not really critical to the submissions I make. I'm not taking you to the model law or the English or the French position as set out in the case just before finally, just want to make a few brief comments on the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdictions.

My Lord, I move from that now to the issue of discretion, which I have touched on earlier today, but will come back to. The New York Convention, as I said, distinguishes quite clearly between mandatory and discretionary obligations. It puts no limits on the extent of the discretion, and the discretion doesn't distinguish this permissive approach between the different grounds.

8	p2,00:48:30.630,00:51:57.500,spk_1,	True	Counsel: It is indeed. And this is from Walter Martin [inaudible] acting for the Government, Your attention is invited to your notice at the 29th of May, in respect of the above matter where our client is required to file its answer to the request for arbitration within 30 days. We wish to bring to your notice that our client has filed legal proceedings in Pakistan, which are pending in the court of Civil Judge First Class Islamabad and are fixed for hearing on the 13th of June 1998. The learner Judge has been pleased to grant an interim injunction pertaining to the dispute. Copy of the court order is attached for your information. And then draw attention to Section 35 of the Arbitration Act, No reference or award shall be rendered invalid by reason only the commencement of legal proceedings on the subject matter of reference, but when legal proceedings on the whole of the subject matter of the reference has been commenced between all parties to the reference, notice there are the arbitrator or umpire, all further proceedings in a pending reference shall, unless estoppel proceedings is granted, under Section 34 be invalid. In this section, the expression, parties to the reference, including any person claiming under any of the parties and litigating under the same title. And the point that, perhaps, is obvious in which the Tribunal made from this is of course, this is the first response to the request. It nowhere says that the respondent is not a party to the Agreement. What it says is we now have an injunction obtained, as it was, without notice from the Government, please do not go on with the arbitration. The next document is the next page, which is the 15th of August. The same lawyers also to the ICC, referring to two further notices, We wish to bring your kind notice that our client has already declined to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Arbitration. It may also be brought into your kind notice that our client does not and shall not submit to the jurisdiction of the ICC. Inter alia the following reasons. There's no contract or arbitration agreement between our parents and Dallah. The contract and arbitration agreement referred to by the claimant were entered into by the claimant, and the Trust. The Trust has already ceased to exist after expiry of the Ordinance. Clause 27 of the contract provides that the Trust may assign or transfer its rights and obligations to the Government without the prior consent in writing of Dallah. The Trust never assigned or transferred its rights and obligations. Contract was entered into and executed in Pakistan and under well established principles of law it's governed by the laws of Pakistan, hence the Arbitration Act is not applicable. Any award passed by the ICC will not be enforceable, being against the public policy and laws of Pakistan. Under Pakistan law, the application of the Protocol on Arbitration Clause's is limited to contracts which are considered as commercial under the law enforced in Pakistan. The contract in question was entered into for religious purposes to provide housing facilities to Pakistan pilgrims. Therefore, the laws of Pakistan don't recognise the protocol and arbitration clause's. Our client never agreed to make a submission to arbitration, and unilateral submission to arbitration by the claimant alone doesn't constitute actual submissions under the laws enforced in Pakistan.

8	p3,00:14:54.390,00:16:08.120,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Well it's background to the context when I'm coming to the review, which I will explain in a moment. But I just want to make this point because what is said, particularly we've come to discretion, is that the competence kompetenz jurisdiction is based on consent. What we submit is based on consent is the entitlement of the arbitrators to go on to hear the decision. If they decide that they haven't got jurisdiction, they cannot go on to hear the substantive merits. If they decide they have got jurisdiction but are wrong in that result, they still can't go on to hear it. But they still have the initial entitlement to make that decision. And that initial entitlement is not dependent on the consent of the parties because it's a functional necessity of the scheme of international arbitration, which otherwise would grind to a halt if every time there was an issue as to whether an arbitrator appointed pursuant to apparently valid agreement was, or was always not entitled to make that described it this way, provisional determination.
8	p5,00:15:19.630,00:15:57.960,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Section 33, Dallah says, You've got no right to seek any relief in relation to the arbitration because you are not a party. And the Pakistan court agrees. That's what happened in the 99 proceedings. One thing I should mention along the way again, we'll leave the facts in a moment because they're probably all of this is once looking at individual points in a continuum. But at the same time, the court must not lose sight of the fact that Dallah is, the Governor of Pakistan is making its position crystal clear in the arbitration itself. It's not a party while the 1998 proceedings are on foot. So I couldn't look at the 1998 proceedings without also taking into account what they were saying to the alleged tribunal.

8	p3,00:18:52.490,00:20:06.330,spk_3,	True	The Court: Yes. I mean, I don't understand the difficulty, really. It seems obvious that if someone is appointed to decide almost anything that person or body can consider whether they are properly appointed and have jurisdiction to decide whatever is they're asked to decide. To elevate that further seems perhaps unnecessary. But perhaps the more important point is this doesn't seem to support the proposition that a partial award on jurisdiction is an award subject to the New York Convention. And if it were, I mean, why wouldn't it be bounding? Because your argument, kompetenz-kompetenz delivers to the arbitrators under some international generally accepted international principles jurisdiction to decide their jurisdiction. If, say, there's nothing in Article five, which would enable the government of Pakistan or anyone to apply to resist enforcement of that award or recognition of it, and we would be bound to recognise the arbitrator's decision then. Wouldn't we? Isn't that the consequence?
8	p5,00:34:00.590,00:35:28.640,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And what's also curious, My Lords, if I may refer you back to page 20, internal, page 20 of the award, paragraph 3. When the tribunal articulates the principles that they're going to apply, they talk about in paragraph 3, Rules of law. They say judicial as well as arbitral case law. Now arbitral case law is a shorthand for Dow Chemical. In my submission, the Dow Chemical I don't know if Your Lordships are familiar with it, but it is an ICC arbitral award that has given rise to what's been called arbitral case law on something called the Groups of Company doctrine, which has come before the English courts occasionally and been roundly rejected. But arbitral case law is not French law. Previous decisions of arbitrators, they say here, arbitral case law now clearly recognise that as a result of the principle of autonomy, the rules of law applicable to an arbitration agreement may differ, then just is a reference to Dalico. And then it says 300 bottom may consist of transnational general principles, which the arbitrators would consider to meet the fundamental requirements of justice. Then, it says Dr Justice Shah and Lord Mustill would not endorse without reservation the concept of a transnational procedural law independent of all national laws. They need not, however, pursue this, since it makes no difference to the results now in my submission, that's difficult to understand. Why does it make no difference to the result?

Can I with your permission can I just wind back to that point? Where we end up is that in my submission, what the tribunal has done is they have applied transnational rules, not French law, and they have conducted an exercise. The important this is the important point. They've conducted an exercise which is not open to a court under Article five of the New York Convention. It may be open to the tribunal sitting in France as arbitrators, but it is not open under the conflict of law rules in Article 5(1)(a) of the New York Convention and equally section 1032 of the 1996 Act.

9	p5,01:15:37.050,01:16:14.820,spk_0,	True	Counsel: There are arbitrators who had -- take different views about transnational ability and the application of transnational rules. The English policy on this, as reflected in Section 46 of the 1996 act, is arbitrators should not overstep the mark. They must apply the law, not rules of law or transnational law, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise. So it's looking through English eyes, for what it's worth, the answer to My Lord Mance's question is, yes. An arbitral tribunal should have one eye on where likely recognition and enforcement may be and not do something which is going to invalidate the award under the convention.

But those are rare agreements, and it's not, in the absence of that agreement, all that you agree in international arbitration rules, in any arbitration agreement, implicitly is, the tribunal may well, like any other court, investigate its own jurisdiction. But it cannot give itself final authority. If, in truth, there is no arbitration agreement, there is nothing which the tribunal can say to change that because they're not a tribunal.

If I can just have another stab, there are various ways you could put it. But another formulation is that the review relates to whether or not the government has proved that the government has to prove a negative, that it didn't consent to arbitration and whether in the exercise of the discretion, the court should refuse to enforce the award. Where we part company with the formulation of the government is that in considering this issue, the court must, not may, consider the award and its reasoning and findings and must give such weight as appropriate in the circumstances of the case in hand to that award as a piece of evidence, together with the other evidential mix and the other factors in the case. And it cannot be a, just as in an appeal, it cannot be an absolutely rigid situation because you will have a variety of different types of situations that will arise. There will be cases where there is a compelling new evidence to give you example in a completely different context. The case of [can't figure out case name], which is a procedural issue. The tribunal went ahead and heard a case where new points were made at the hearing, whether the responded unfortunately, severely ill and didn't have an opportunity to present his case. And it was late in the in the enforcement hearing that it became apparent that he had not had this opportunity and that new points have been put at the hearing. And in that case, it was the only case where the New York Convention had not been set aside. The gentleman had cancer and had been ill for over a year. Lord Phillips I think that was, the judge said, that there would be severe injustice, and clearly this was a case where there was new evidence which indicated a completely different state of affairs.

9	p3,00:04:22.300,00:06:38.650,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The principle can be wide. It's not arbitrary, obviously, but it can be wide. But I was going to leave that to the second stage, and I was really just at the moment, laying the groundwork for the first point, which is the review point. The second point, I was just going to make again, just summarising what's in article sections three and four of my case that an award can only be set aside the seat of the arbitration when an award is set aside that in itself provides an independent ground under Article 5 for refusing enforcement and in this case, France being the seat, it can only be set aside in France, the difference being when you're seeking to enforce. And this is an important point when one seeking to enforce an award, it can be enforced in any one of 144 countries, and therefore there is scope for diversity. Unless principles are established, which would undermine the effectiveness of the New York Convention. There are just to make it clear that I accept there is no obligation on a party to go to the seat to have the awards set aside. There are two options, but the options present a choice to that party, and that party may find that if it elects not to go to the seat, the grounds upon which the award can be challenged are more limited. In England, you have Section 67. In other countries, you may have a much wider review of different grounds. It will vary from country to country, but when you come to the enforcement in many situations, though not in all in the model law, the grounds of the same. But in some situations, the grounds under Article 5 will be less. And so that party has to take a decision entirely up to that party, whether it wants to restrict itself to the Article 5 grounds or go earlier to set it aside to make it clear it's not an obligation.

9	p3,00:14:54.390,00:16:08.120,spk_2,	True	Counsel: Well it's background to the context when I'm coming to the review, which I will explain in a moment. But I just want to make this point because what is said, particularly we've come to discretion, is that the competence kompetenz jurisdiction is based on consent. What we submit is based on consent is the entitlement of the arbitrators to go on to hear the decision. If they decide that they haven't got jurisdiction, they cannot go on to hear the substantive merits. If they decide they have got jurisdiction but are wrong in that result, they still can't go on to hear it. But they still have the initial entitlement to make that decision. And that initial entitlement is not dependent on the consent of the parties because it's a functional necessity of the scheme of international arbitration, which otherwise would grind to a halt if every time there was an issue as to whether an arbitrator appointed pursuant to apparently valid agreement was, or was always not entitled to make that described it this way, provisional determination.
9	p4,01:21:53.810,01:23:08.350,spk_3,	True	The Court: Can I just take up one point, because one wouldn't want to say anything on it that was inappropriate for the future. But you've referred to the American distinction between arguments about the scope of an award and arguments about whether there was an arbitration agreement at all. I mean, I can see that if you've got an arbitration body, one would give particular attention to their view as to whether an issue was within their powers. But as a matter of logic, if an issue arose under Article 5(1)(c) as to whether the award dealt with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, as a matter of logic, it's difficult to see why the court's approach to that should be any different from its approach to question whether there is a valid arbitration agreement at all. And the issue is, essentially, whether there's a valid arbitration agreement covering what was decided, and that should be an issue which a party is entitled to come to court to argue and have decided, if a party hasn't submitted something to arbitration, then it hasn't submitted it.
9	p6,00:34:25.280,00:35:19.480,spk_3,	True	Counsel: Well established as a basic legal rule of the international law of arbitration, international arbitration agreements are autonomous, and that such autonomy means on the one hand the Arbitration agreement is separable from the main contract which relates and that its existence and validity are to be determined on the basis of its own terms. And then if you go, for example, to Paragraph 3, where we have a further reference to the French test judicial as well as arbitral case law now clearly recognised that as a result of the principle of autonomy, the rules of law applicable to an arbitration agreement may differ from those governing the main contract. Such rules need not be linked to a particular national law, and they refer to Dalico but may consist of those transnational general principles.

9	p2,01:01:19.710,01:03:07.520,spk_1,	True	Counsel: If you start at page 67, application of the substantive rules method by courts reviewing arbitral awards, Generally speaking, the circumstances in which the French courts will examine the validity of an arbitration agreement are fairly limited as a result of the kompetenz-kompetenz principle, on the limited grounds on which an award can be set aside or refused of enforcement. The issue will arise where parties petition for an award to be set aside or enforced, and where it is alleged that either the award was made in the absence of an agreement, on the basis of an arbitration agreement was void or had expired, or the arbitral tribunal declined jurisdiction after wrongly deciding that an arbitration agreement was non existent or invalid. It was in this context that the court held that the existence and effectiveness of the arbitration agreement would only be scrutinised in the light of the requirements of international public policy to use the expression coined by the Paris Court's of Appeals. We've seen that the criticism levelled against these decisions was prompted by the court's use of unfortunate terminology regarding the arbitration agreements own effectiveness and was particularly concerned that the practical and theoretical impossibility of basing the validity of the contract on no law at all. The criticism is unfounded however, in French case law the intention is not to remove the arbitration agreement from all forms of control. It is instead to restrict such control to review of the arbitration agreement in the light of the French conception of fundamental requirements of justice in international commerce, referred to by the French courts as international public policy. Although the goal is not to avoid the application of the law otherwise competent, the expression international public policy is well chosen where the decision to be taken is whether or not a dispute is arbitrable, an issue falling with the scope of --
9	p3,00:18:52.490,00:20:06.330,spk_3,	True	The Court: Yes. I mean, I don't understand the difficulty, really. It seems obvious that if someone is appointed to decide almost anything that person or body can consider whether they are properly appointed and have jurisdiction to decide whatever is there are some decide to elevate that further seems perhaps unnecessary. But perhaps the more important point is this doesn't seem to support the proposition that a partial award on jurisdiction is an award subject to the New York Convention. And if it were, I mean, why wouldn't it be bounding? Because your argument, kompetenz-kompetenz delivers to the arbitrators under some international generally accepted international principles jurisdiction to decide their jurisdiction. If, say, there's nothing in Article five, which would enable the government of Pakistan or anyone to apply to resist enforcement of that award or recognition of it, and we will be bound to recognise the arbitrator's decision then. Would we? Isn't that the consequence?

I'm not taking you to the model law or the English or the French position as set out in the case just before finally, just want to make a few brief comments on the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdictions. Let me make it clear that we accept that the tribunal is not the final arbiter of its own jurisdiction. It is subject to review being described as by Gaillard Chronological review, and it can happen at various stages. It could happen by way of a preliminary ruling under Article 16(3) of the model law or Section 32 in this country. It can happen by way of setting aside, and it can happen at the enforcement stage. But there is an important, vital distinction to be made between the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction, which is the jurisdiction to determine whether or not that tribunal has substantive jurisdiction. In other words, to go on here in the merits and the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction itself, uh huh. And the conclusion of an exercise of a kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction may be right, or it may be wrong. But that tribunal, pursuant to that kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction still in our submission has jurisdiction to make the wrong decision. I may be wrong, and it can be set aside or it can not be enforced. But it doesn't undermine the initial entitlement of the arbitrators to make that decision. And that decision again, even if right or wrong remains binding, it may not be enforced because it's wrong, but as a partial award in this case, it is a binding award because the convention recognises, as does the English statute, partial awards.

10	p1,00:02:12.420,00:03:54.116,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I was commenting on the facility with which awards can be enforced under the New York Convention is the key to such success trumping the often more difficult process of enforcement of judgments internationally and as Your Lordships' will have seen. This is the only the second reported case since England incorporated the New York Convention in the 1975 act, where an English court has refused to enforce a New York convention award under Article 51 of the Convention. The case has huge international implications as it signals whether the practice of the English courts in relation to enforcement matches its stated pro enforcement stance. The Court of Appeal decision and the decision below have attracted considerable interest and criticism from around the world. The English attitude to arbitration was until the 1996 Act, somewhat out of line with other countries. That act was a major shift towards harmonisation of arbitral procedures and a less intrusive role for the courts, though it did not adopt the model law in every respect. Today we are considering only part of that act, namely those section's which incorporated the New York Convention. I find myself in this appeal in a somewhat unusual position in that if I look ahead to Lord Saville in front of me, I see the author of the Act. And If I Look to My Left to Mr Landau, I see a drafter. So I hope that those gentlemen known far more about the ideology of the act than I do will bear with me as I proceed to analyse.

10	p5,00:37:47.450,00:38:21.180,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Because the French or in arbitrators sitting in France, they are entitled by conflicts of law to treat the arbitration agreement as governed by transnational principles. Because of the nature of the arbitration agreement. It is an agreement which has validity by reference to a transnational legal order different from other contracts. That's a conception of arbitration that we do not have in England, but they do have in in some civil law countries. So there are French rules which allow them to do that for the arbitration clause.
10	p3,00:20:54.520,00:21:46.360,spk_2,	True	Counsel: You wouldn't say it's not binding. This is this is the point my Lord. There's a distinction between binding in Article 3 and enforceability because even if this court fails to enforce the award, the award exists and can be enforced in another jurisdiction. The role of enforcing court is not, however, egregious the what's gone wrong. It has not got the power to set aside the award. All I can say is we in this country will not enforce it, whether it's public policy or whether it's Article 5. But the award still exists as an international instrument, and I know that in a sense, it's difficult to comprehend. One was looking at in a national context, but in an international context, that is the position.

10	p3,00:08:05.810,00:08:43.710,spk_3,	True	The Court: Isn't there a lurking inconsistency of attitude here? I mean, at certain parts of your case, you stress how transnational and supranational arbitration is, and really, the place of the seat of the arbitration is an irrelevance, and it's all subject to transnational considerations. And yet, you say as soon as you go transnationally, you find that the seat becomes rather important and that you're worse off when you seek to resist enforcement than you would be in the place of the seat.
10	p3,00:06:46.370,00:08:05.800,spk_2,	True	The Court: Across the two? Well between setting inside and recognise on the one hand and recognition and enforcement. On the other hand, there may be different standards. It will depend upon the countries. Some countries give a much wider brief to what you can take into account. Section 67 is not really limited in determining whether or not there is jurisdiction. Other countries which have adopted the model law, Section 30, Article 34, 36. Article 34 deals with annulment, 36 is enforcement, have the same principles, so it depends on different situations. But here in France, when you apply to set aside, it's a wide review. But when you come to the enforcement, the enforcement is limited to the Article 5 grants and other countries. It might be different, so the point I'm making is I'm not saying the government had an obligation to go to France. What I am saying is that by not going to France, it elected to choose to take its chance with an enforcing court which may not necessarily be in England. It could have been anywhere in the world of 144.

That would be Section 66 of the 1996 Act. It's a domestic process. As it happens. Can I make this point by where verbal footnote only as it happens, if you go to France with a French award, they will do exactly the same thing as they do under the New York Convention. They will apply French law to this question of initial consent, and the case on that is SPP Pyramids. That was a French enforcement. There's a very famous case we keep mentioning. It's an instance of the enforcement of a French award in France applying French law where the tribunal applied a very similar set of principles as this tribunal is done to attach it, to make a government a party that was not a signatory. And when the French court reviewed it at enforcement stage, they applied French law.

Where we end up is that in my submission, what the tribunal has done is they have applied transnational rules, not French law, and they have conducted an exercise. The important this is the important point. They've conducted an exercise which is not open to a court under Article five of the New York Convention. It may be open to the tribunal sitting in France as arbitrators, but it is not open under the conflict of law rules in Article 5(1)(a) of the New York Convention and equally section 1032 of the 1996 Act.

In other words, to go on here in the merits and the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction itself. And the conclusion of an exercise of a kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction may be right, or it may be wrong. But that tribunal, pursuant to that kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction still in our submission has jurisdiction to make the wrong decision. I may be wrong, and it can be set aside or it can not be enforced. But it doesn't undermine the initial entitlement of the arbitrators to make that decision. And that decision again, even if right or wrong remains binding, it may not be enforced because it's wrong, but as a partial award in this case, it is a binding award because the convention recognises, as does the English statute, partial awards.

And it's not the successor of the trust that there's no privity of contract. Now, in my submission, what's relevant here, as was found by Mr Justice Aikens and the Court of Appeal is if you, as you have to do through French eyes, look at the full chronology from beginning to end, you've got the 1998 proceedings sandwiched between, it's a short period of time, sandwiched between 97 where it's the trust bringing a claim and then 99 where the government is saying we're not a party to any of this. If you take a reasonable fair view of that, you can't take that six month period, in my submission, as being an admission by the government that it is a party to the arbitration agreement. If nothing else, one can see reasonably why they acted in that way because the judge gave them a false lead, but also through French eyes. The test is whether it's subjective or objective. Were they -- are they to be taken as having accepted an arbitration clause. Well, in my submission, starting a court proceeding is a curious way of accepting an arbitration clause.

Kindly take into account the above factors and reflect the claim as the same is not maintainable. However, this letter shall not in any way and manner deemed to constitute on the part of our client a submission and acquiescence to the proceedings. Nor have we any instructions from our client authorising us to join the proceeding or to represent it in any proceedings. And I think that for present purposes, is as far as I need to take you. And what I would like to do now with Your Lordship's permission is to take you, with that outline of the facts, to the tribunal's reasoning and the judge's reasoning. But before I do so, can I just make a few points. First of all, you will have seen from my learned friend's case that I have, perhaps, been roundly criticised for saying different things at different stages of the proceedings. My Lord, forensically, one often refines and changes one's submissions and I hope what I say today will be better and more persuasive than my submissions in the past. Let me make six brief points before I take you to the documents. First, before the tribunal, the parties argued, respectively, for Saudi law and Pakistan law. It was the tribunal which decided, as it was entitled to do as a tribunal with a French seat, to apply transnational law. And it ultimately agreed in relation to the main agreement, the arbitration agreement being separable, that the main agreement will be determined according to Saudi law. So, you have, perhaps, a case which is not uncommon, but a little unusual, where the arbitration agreement is determined by a different law from the main agreement.
11	p3,00:44:40.650,00:47:01.410,spk_2,	True	Counsel: I accept and that is why there is an issue to be determined by this court, because it's an issue that hasn't actually been resolved certainly at this level as to whether, unlike the Section 67 which is accepted as a rehearing, what is the standard of review that and enforcing court as opposed to a setting aside, court should adopt when looking at an international prevention award. If I can just have another stab, there are various ways you could put it. But another formulation is that the review relates to whether or not the government has proved that the government has to prove a negative, that it didn't consent to arbitration and whether in the exercise of the discretion, the court should refuse to enforce the award. Where we part company with the formulation of the government is that in considering this issue, the court must, not may, consider the award and its reasoning and findings and must give such weight is appropriate in the circumstances of the case in hand to that award as a piece of evidence, together with the other evidential mix and the other factors in the case. And it cannot be a just as in an appeal. It cannot be an absolutely rigid situation because you will have a variety of different types of situations that will arise. There will be cases where there is a compelling new evidence to give you example in a completely different context. The case of [can't figure out case name], which is a procedural issue. The tribunal went ahead and heard a case where new points were made at the hearing, whether the responded unfortunately, severely ill and didn't have an opportunity to present his case. And it was late in the in the enforcement hearing that it became apparent that he had not had this opportunity and that new points have been put at the hearing. And in that case, it was the only case where the New York Convention had not been set aside. The gentleman had cancer and had been ill for over a year. Lord Phillips. I think that was, the judge said, that there would be severe injustice, and clearly this was a case where there was new evidence which indicated a completely different state of affairs.

11	p5,00:49:25.630,00:50:06.850,spk_0,	True	Counsel: When we got to this, because we were looking at trying to understand the tribunal's award. Can I with your permission can I just wind back to that point? Where we end up is that in my submission, what the tribunal has done is they have applied transnational rules, not French law, and they have conducted an exercise. The important this is the important point. They've conducted an exercise which is not open to a court under Article five of the New York Convention. It may be open to the tribunal sitting in France as arbitrators, but it is not open under the conflict of law rules in Article 5(1)(a) of the New York Convention and equally section 1032 of the 1996 Act.

11	p6,00:34:25.280,00:35:19.480,spk_3,	True	Counsel: Well established as a basic legal rule of the international law of arbitration, international arbitration agreements are autonomous, and that such autonomy means on the one hand the Arbitration agreement is separable from the main contract which relates and that its existence and validity are to be determined on the basis of its own terms. And then if you go, for example, to Paragraph 3, where we have a further reference to the French test judicial as well as arbitral case law now clearly recognised that as a result of the principle of autonomy, the rules of law applicable to an arbitration agreement may differ from those governing the main contract. Such rules need not be linked to a particular national law, and they refer to Dalico but may consist of those transnational general principles.
11	p5,00:34:00.590,00:35:28.640,spk_0,	True	Counsel: And what's also curious, My Lords, if I may refer you back to page 20, internal, page 20 of the award, paragraph 3. When the tribunal articulates the principles that they're going to apply, they talk about in paragraph 3, Rules of law. They say judicial as well as arbitral case law. Now arbitral case law is a shorthand for Dow Chemical. In my submission, the Dow Chemical I don't know if Your Lordships are familiar with it, but it is an ICC arbitral award that has given rise to what's been called arbitral case law on something called the Groups of Company doctrine, which has come before the English courts occasionally and been roundly rejected. But arbitral case law is not French law. Previous decisions of arbitrators, they say here, arbitral case law now clearly recognise that as a result of the principle of autonomy, the rules of law applicable to an arbitration agreement may differ, then just is a reference to Dalico. And then it says 300 bottom, May consist of transnational general principles, which the arbitrators would consider to meet the fundamental requirements of justice. Then, it says, Dr Justice Shah and Lord Mustill would not endorse without reservation the concept of a transnational procedural law independent of all national laws. They need not, however, pursue this, since it makes no difference to the results now in my submission, that's difficult to understand. Why does it make no difference to the result?
11	p5,00:15:19.630,00:15:57.960,spk_0,	True	Counsel: Section 33, Dallah says, You've got no right to seek any relief in relation to the arbitration because you are not a party. And the Pakistan court agrees. That's what happened in the 99 proceedings. One thing I should mention along the way again, we'll leave the facts in a moment because they're probably all of this is once looking at individual points in a continuum. But at the same time, the court must not lose sight of the fact that Dallah is, the Governor of Pakistan is making its position crystal clear in the arbitration itself. It's not a party while the 1998 proceedings are on foot. So I couldn't look at the 1998 proceedings without also taking into account what they were saying to the alleged tribunal.
11	p2,00:48:30.630,00:51:57.500,spk_1,	True	Counsel: It is indeed. And this is from Walter Martin [inaudible] acting for the Government, Your attention is invited to your notice at the 29th of May, in respect of the above matter where our client is required to file its answer to the request for arbitration within 30 days. We wish to bring to your notice that our client has filed legal proceedings in Pakistan, which are pending in the court of Civil Judge First Class Islamabad and are fixed for hearing on the 13th of June 1998. The learner Judge has been pleased to grant an interim injunction pertaining to the dispute. Copy of the court order is attached for your information. And then draw attention to Section 35 of the Arbitration Act, No reference or award shall be rendered invalid by reason only the commencement of legal proceedings on the subject matter of reference, but when legal proceedings on the whole of the subject matter of the reference has been commenced between all parties to the reference, notice there are the arbitrator or umpire, all further proceedings in a pending reference shall, unless estoppel proceedings is granted, under Section 34 be invalid. In this section, the expression, parties to the reference, including any person claiming under any of the parties and litigating under the same title. And the point that, perhaps, is obvious in which the Tribunal made from this is of course, this is the first response to the request. It nowhere says that the respondent is not a party to the Agreement. What it says is we now have an injunction obtained, as it was, without notice from the Government, please do not go on with the arbitration. The next document is the next page, which is the 15th of August. The same lawyers also to the ICC, referring to two further notices, We wish to bring your kind notice that our client has already declined to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Arbitration. It may also be brought into your kind notice that our client does not and shall not submit to the jurisdiction of the ICC. Inter alia the following reasons. There's no contract or arbitration agreement between our parents and Dallah. The contract and arbitration agreement referred to by the claimant were entered into by the claimant, and the Trust. The Trust has already ceased to exist after expiry of the Ordinance. Clause 27 of the contract provides that the Trust may assign or transfer its rights and obligations to the Government without the prior consent in writing of Dallah. The Trust never assigned or transferred its rights and obligations. Contract was entered into and executed in Pakistan and under well established principles of law it's governed by the laws of Pakistan, hence the Arbitration Act is not applicable. Any award passed by the ICC will not be enforceable, being against the public policy and laws of Pakistan. Under Pakistan law, the application of the Protocol on Arbitration Clause's is limited to contracts which are considered as commercial under the law enforced in Pakistan. The contract in question was entered into for religious purposes to provide housing facilities to Pakistan pilgrims. Therefore, the laws of Pakistan don't recognise the protocol and arbitration clauses. Our client never agreed to make a submission to arbitration, and unilateral submission to arbitration by the claimant alone doesn't constitute actual submissions under the laws enforced in Pakistan.
11	p6,00:05:57.480,00:06:49.010,spk_3,	True	Counsel: Includes not only issues as to the validity of the agreement but also, whether or not, just to read the exact words, Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may rule on its own substantive jurisdiction. That is, as to whether there is a valid arbitration agreement, whether the tribunal is properly constituted and what matters have been submitted to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement, and that by Section 82 is stated to be the meaning of substantive jurisdiction. So the point of these comments is that if jurisdiction is based on consent, which I think everybody in this room agrees upon, such consent is not confined to what my learned friend calls the a priori situation, but it can also be a situation where the tribunal is constituted but it takes upon itself something which the parties had not agreed that it would determine.

12	p3,00:18:52.490,00:20:06.330,spk_3,	True	The Court: Yes. I mean, I don't understand the difficulty, really. It seems obvious that if someone is appointed to decide almost anything that person or body can consider whether they are properly appointed and have jurisdiction to decide whatever is there are some decide to elevate that further seems perhaps unnecessary. But perhaps the more important point is this doesn't seem to support the proposition that a partial award on jurisdiction is an award subject to the New York Convention. And if it were, I mean, why wouldn't it be bounding? Because your argument, kompetenz-kompetenz delivers to the arbitrators under some international generally accepted international principles jurisdiction to decide their jurisdiction. If, say, there's nothing in Article five, which would enable the government of Pakistan or anyone to apply to resist enforcement of that award or recognition of it, and we will be bound to recognise the arbitrator's decision then. Would we? Isn't that the consequence?

12	p3,00:12:46.860,00:14:49.960,spk_2,	True	Counsel: I just really wanted to dispel what I think has become a point, which in a sense is not really critical to the submissions I make. I'm not taking you to the model law or the English or the French position as set out in the case just before finally, just want to make a few brief comments on the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdictions. Let me make it clear that we accept that the tribunal is not the final arbiter of its own jurisdiction. It is subject to review being described as by Gaillard Chronological review, and it can happen at various stages. It could happen by way of a preliminary ruling under Article 16(3) of the model law or Section 32 in this country. It can happen by way of setting aside, and it can happen at the enforcement stage. But there is an important, vital distinction to be made between the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction, which is the jurisdiction to determine whether or not that tribunal has substantive jurisdiction.

12	p1,00:05:55.910,00:08:20.215,spk_0,	True	Counsel: This has a much wider implication, that was the only point I was making at the state. My Lord, as Your Lordship knows, but just for the benefit, perhaps, of those behind us. The case concerns enforcement of a unanimous ICC arbitration award rendered in Paris by an eminent international tribunal, comprising Lord Michael Mustill, Dr Nassim Hasan Shah, former chief justice of Pakistan, and Dr Ghaleb Mahmassani, who's a Lebanese lawyer who was the chair. In 1995, Dallah, my clients proposed to the government of Pakistan the idea of providing housing in Mecca for pilgrims performing hajj. This in due course led to a memorandum of understanding on the 24th of July 1995 made between Dallah and the government and later on the 10th of September 1996 to the agreement the subject matter of this appeal. The agreement was on its face, stated to be made between Dallah and the trust, a state entity. The respondent, the government of Pakistan was not a signatory to the agreement, nor was it named as a party. Had it been, we would not be here today, the first issue before the tribunal and the focus of the English proceedings concerned whether or not the government was a party to the arbitration clause in that agreement. The tribunal found on the law and on the facts that it was. It subsequently found the government to be a party to the underlying agreement and in Dallah's favour on liability and awarded it 18,900,007 odd dollars in damages. Together with costs, the government did not waive jurisdiction before the arbitral tribunal and has asserted sovereign immunity. If, however, it is found to be a party to the arbitration agreement, it is deemed by virtue of Section 9 of the State Immunity at 1978 to have waived its immunity in relation to the arbitration proceedings that is different from enforcement against assets. Dallah obtained leave to enforce the award as a judgment of the English court. This was challenged by the government under Section 103(2)(b) of the 1996 Act. The basis of the challenge being that it is not valid under the law to which the parties subjected it or failing any indication thereon under the law of the country where the award was made.

12	p2,01:24:26.660,01:25:25.770,spk_1,	True	Counsel: The first point, the first was the Saudi law. The second was my concession in relation to the law being substantive law. The third point was our discussion about transnational law. The fourth was the evidence which I have taken you to, the fifth, which I didn't really pursue in the light of what we've been discussing, which was the more restrictive approach of English laws to transnational law because English law doesn't recognise a non-national law for the purposes of an arbitration clause. And the final point was the fact that there wasn't any new evidence. The onus, of course, being on the Government of Pakistan to prove its case. I'm going to take you, if I may, to the award and start at page 26 internally, which is really the paper 414.

So here, if the chosen Saudi law -- yes -- to apply to the substance, that wouldn't affect necessarily the governing law of the arbitration agreement. So what happens under the act if they they have chosen the law to govern the substance of the agreement? Sorry, there is a choice of law in the agreement as there was here, but there is a dispute as to whether a party is a is a party to the arbitration agreement. And then the arbitrators apply transnational rules of law to determine that question.
13	p2,01:33:46.560,01:35:42.240,spk_1,	True	Counsel: I think it must be, yes. But he explained why. It's significant also to note in this respect, the defendant's position in these arbitration proceedings, regarding the letter of the 19th of January, did not deal with the substance of contents of such letter, but was rather limited to a formal and very general challenge of the validity of said letter on the ground that such letter was absolutely unauthorised, illegal, and of no effect, because all office bearers of the Trust, including the secretary, had ceased to have any authority to act for the defunct trust, such challenge is, however completely unfounded as the signatory of the letter of the 19th of January 1997, Mr Lutfullah Mufti did not sign such letter in his capacity as official for the Trust, to which, anyway, the letter makes no reference at all, but in his capacity as secretary of the defendant, the Ministry of Religious Affairs, which is an integral part of the Government of Pakistan. As such, the signatory of the letter engages and binds the Government as he has continued to bind it during the whole previous period where the Trust was in existence. In consequence, the signature of the said letter by the secretary of defendant may only be explained and construed as another evidence of confirmation that the defendant considered itself a party to the Agreement, exercising the rights and assuming the responsibilities thereunder. The fact is the more significant because after the elapse of the Trust, the defendant could have remained silent and have abstained from any involvement with regard to the Agreement signed with the claimant on the ground that it was not a party to such agreement and therefore was not concerned by it. But the defendant, on the contrary, took the initiative after the elapse of Trust, and wrote a letter in its name for the claimant, involving itself as a party to the Agreement and treating such Agreement as repudiated [inaudible], such conduct of the defendant clearly confirms that this latter was acting as a contracting party to the Agreement in a quite unequivocal way.

13	p2,01:29:29.610,01:33:37.730,spk_1,	True	The Court: Are they all in the bundle? Counsel: I believe they're all, and I think they were only an example. The Court: Yes, right. Counsel: It is the defendant that decided to delegate to the Trust, the finalisation, signature, and implementation of the Agreement with the claimant, which the defendant and negotiated pursuant the MOU of July 1995, which appeared to be the main purpose for the establishment of the Trust. It said, It was signed by the Minister of Religious affairs, acting as chairman of the board. It refers to the successive promulgations. At 9(2) the defendant was contractually involved in the Agreement as the Government was bound under Article 2 to give its guarantee for the financial facility to be raised. The point I made earlier, that the guarantee was not a guarantee of its performance, but it was the trigger to enable the finance and the whole contract to begin. And at Article 27 of the Agreement, It was authorised to assign its rights and obligations to the Government, i.e. to the defendant, without the prior approval of the claimant. Such a clause is normally used only when the assignee is very closely linked to the assignor or is under its total control through ownership, management, or otherwise. Then the period of performance, During the lifetime of the Agreement, the defendant continued to handle matters relating to the Agreement signed by the Trust and to act to conduct itself in a way that confirmed that it regarded the Agreement as its own. And then it deals with beside the exercise of the regulatory powers, undertake -- officials of the defendant continue to be actively involved in the implementation of the Agreement, as they were previously in negotiation. Refers to the two letters of 26th of September 1996, and 4th of November, that was, those were the two letters I showed you relating to the implementation of rules for the funds which had been set up, and it's right that they had in fact been set up by the Trust. And it then, at 10(2), although the Trust enjoyed, under the Ordinance, legal and financial independence and capacity to own property and assets, and to dispose thereof it does not appear from the actual facts, as submitted by the parties, that the Trust effectively had any funds or assets of its own during its short lifetime, there's no evidence of any schemes or plans made to raise funds and to mobilise pilgrim's savings, nor of any transactions made and implemented by the Trust for the purpose of generating funds to finance its activities. Apparently, it seems as if the only activity conducted by the Trust was the signature of the Agreement with the claimant, with the implementation being followed up by the Ministry of Religious Affairs itself and as if the Trust was not given the human and financial means that could have enabled it to exercise fully its functions as an autonomous legal entity, and has therefore remained as an empty shell with all effective powers being exercised by the defendant itself. It was the Government which decided by a discretionary act or omission not to remit, promulgate the Ordinance, the end of four months from the date of its second re-promulgation, and therefore to put an end to the Trust on the 12th of December 1996 pursuant to the repeal of the Ordinance as a result of its non re-promulgation. The very existence of the Trust appears thus been depending merely on an attitude of non-action by the Government, demonstrating the fragile existence of the Trust, and it's complete dependability upon the Government, even for its own life. And then it refers to the letter of January 1997, and summarises the letter in the first paragraph on page 32. The second paragraph, such letter is very significant because it confirmed, in the clearest way possible, that the defendant, after the elapse of the Trust, regarded the Agreement with the claimant as its own and considered itself as a party to such agreement and, as such, was entitled to exercise all rights and assume more responsibilities provided for under such agreement.
13	p5,00:08:42.500,00:10:06.050,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I won't go into Section 33 but all it needs to know my submission is that this is a full -- a full hearing before the court, an application for a declaration that the government was never a party to the agreement. And it's not the successor of the trust that there's no privity of contract now. In my submission, what's what's relevant here, as was found by Mr Justice Aikens and the Court of Appeal is if you, as you have to do through French eyes, look at the full chronology from beginning to end, you've got the 1998 proceedings sandwiched between, it's a short period of time, sandwiched between 97 where it's the trust bringing a claim and then 99 where the government is saying we're not a party to any of this. If you take a reasonable fair view of that, you can't take that six month period, in my submission, as being an admission by the government that it is a party to the arbitration agreement. If nothing else, one can see reasonably why they acted in that way because the judge gave them a false lead, but also through French eyes. The test is whether it's subjective or objective. Were they -- are they to be taken as having accepted an arbitration clause. Well, in my submission, starting a court proceeding is a curious way of accepting an arbitration clause.

13	p2,01:26:31.980,01:29:28.290,spk_1,	True	Counsel: This is common intention. I'm not going to read it all, My Lord, I'm just going to select points because a lot of it already, but just to summarise, I mean 8.1 deals with what happened and the introduction of which you are now familiar. If you go to 8.2, the tribunal makes the point having explained the overlap, and I'm using this as a neutral word because there isn't, we're not running the alter ego argument, but the overlap between what the Ministry of Religious Affairs does and what the Trust does, consequently, the defendant, by signing the MOU, was conducting an activity which falls normally within the functions entrusted to it by the applicable rules. At 8(3), Thereafter it was the defendant by an act of sovereignty, took the decision to establish the Trust on the 14th of February, pursuant to Section 3 of the Ordinance in exercise of powers conferred by Clause 1 of Article 89 of the constitution, which empowers the president to promulgate an ordinance when the national assembly is not in session. Next paragraph, It was the defendant that defined the objects of the Trust and determined the functions that were to be delegated to it, and that included the function of adopting measures for facilitating the performance of Hajj. Then it goes on to deal with the overlap of the functions dealt with by the Government and the Trust, and then 8.4, The organic control of the defendant over the Trust resulting from the Ordinance provisions regarding the composition of the board of the Trust, the Government's prerogatives as to certain functions, though insufficient to lead to the disregard of a separate legal entity of the Trust, as explained above here, constitutes nevertheless an element of evidence as to the true intention of the defendant to run and control directly, and indirectly the activities of the Trust. And this part is not open to me to view the Trust as one of its instruments because I'm not arguing alter ego. He then again goes through the various parts of the Ordinance which we've been through. 8.5, This conclusion is confirmed by the continuous involvement of the Government in the negotiations with the claimant, despite the establishment of the Trust in fact, before the signature of the Agreement and in spite of the recent establishment of the Trust on the 14th of February, all correspondence concerning the finalisation of the pending matters in the project continued to be exchanged with the Government itself, MORA, or Ministry of Finance, and not with the Trust. They then referred to a series of letters, page 30, The conduct of the defendant at the time of the signature -- 
13	p2,01:39:00.570,01:40:55.820,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Under such judicial proceedings, the defendant in the second set of proceedings, the June 1998 suit, while alleging the Agreement with the plaintiff was no more binding because it's been repudiated, admitted thereby it was a party to such agreement and that it could accept a repudiation of the Agreement by the claimant. And then it deals with the Pakistan proceedings, if I go to 12, And the aforementioned close scrutiny of all the factual elements relating to the conduct of the defendant with regard to the negotiation, signature, implementation, and termination of the agreement as well as with regard to the establishment operation expiry of the Trust, it is clearly established that the Trust established by the defendant was assigned an object, formed part of the functions of the defendant, was organically and operationally under the strict control of defendant, moreover its financial and administrative dependence was largely theoretical because it didn't have any funds or assets of its own. And as all that concerned the Agreement with the claimant whether before or after signature, continued to be performed by the defendant concurrently with the Trust. Following the lapse of the Trust, the Trust functions that were originally discharged by the defendant, reverted back logically to this letter with all rights and obligations of the defunct Trust. The Trust, in spite of its distinct [inaudible] personality in theory, appears thus in fact and in conduct to have been considered to have acted as part of the division of the defendant to which it is fully assimilated. The temporary instrument has been created by a political decision of the defendant, the specific activities which the defendant wanted to perform and which was cancelled also by a political decision of the defendant. Therefore, the Trust seems to appear -- now this is the alter ego point -- have been no more than the alter ego of the defendant, which appears in substance as the real party and interest and therefore as the proper party to the agreement and the arbitration with the claimant.
13	p2,00:13:55.940,00:16:46.750,spk_1,	True	Counsel: So, on the second of June, some three months later, having done nothing, the Government brings identical proceedings to the 1997 proceedings seeking identical relief, changing some of the wording which is consistent with the change of plaintiff. And so again, if you go to flag B1, you see the plaintiff name changes. At paragraph 1, the Trust was a body corporate the Secretary of Religious Affairs government of Pakistan was the Secretary constituted under Section 5. Then 2, that under Article 89 the aforesaid Ordinance stood lapse on expiry of four months from the date of its promulgation. As such, the Trust established no longer remained in field. The present suit is, therefore, being filed by Pakistan who issued the said Ordinance. And then if you jump to 6, The parties, the party now, of course, being the Government, entered into an agreement dated the 10th of September at Islamabad. 7, to be effective as from the date, the defendant receives, again, the advanced lease payment from the Trust and submits the requisite performance bond in the terms of the Agreement. But as per Clause 2, and you can see it's a scissors and paste job, the plaintiff Trust was required to pay a lump sum. 9, that the payment of the above mentioned advanced by the plaintiff i.e. the GOP not the plaintiff Trust in this case. But if you jump to 11, it's perhaps the clearest. Under Clause 4 of the Agreement, the defendant was also under an obligation to submit detailed specifications and drawings of the Makkah housing project, but the defendant complied -- failed to comply with this fundamental term of the Agreement which tantamount to a repudiation of the whole agreement which repudiation was accordingly accepted by the plaintiff. On this case, the plaintiff is the Government in its letter of the 19th of January 1997, and that on account of the repudiation of the Agreement, the same is no longer binding on the plaintiff, the Government, and the defendant is not entitled to raise any claim. And in 14, that in January 1997 refers to the Trust instituting a suit was, however, dismissed the order of the 24th of February, and sets out the grounds, and then over the page, The learned Civil Court observed, however, that liabilities and duties against the defendant can be agitated by the Government of Pakistan. That the cause of action accrued to the plaintiff against the defendant at Islamabad. Firstly, when the defendant, the Government, entered into the Agreement and thereafter when it defaulted in fulfilling the preconditions of the agreement, and the same was repudiated.
13	p2,01:42:48.600,01:44:03.990,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Certainly many of the above mentioned factual elements, if isolated and taken into a fragmented way, may not be construed as sufficiently conclusive. However, Dr Mahmassani believes, when all the factual elements are looked at globally as a whole, such elements constitute a comprehensive set of evidence that may be relied upon to conclude that the defendant is a true party to the Agreement with the claimant and therefore a proper party to the dispute that has arisen with the claimant under the present arbitration proceedings. Whilst joining in this conclusion, Dr Shah, and Lord Mustill, note that they do so with some hesitation, considering the case lies very close to the line. That conclusion finds additional support in the general principle of good faith, that should preside over the implementation of agreements as well as in the general requirements of morality and fairness, that should not be ignored in international transactions. In the view of Dr Mahmassani, these general principles command and require that a state which is a party to agreement for a state owned entity should not be able to avoid it's obligations by having such entity made insolvent or by ending itself the existence of such entity. Such a situation by leaving the other contracting party without any contractual counterpart without any protections to its rights, is unacceptable, unfair, and contrary to all requirements of morality and good faith.
13	p1,00:05:55.910,00:08:20.215,spk_0,	True	Counsel: That was the only point I was making at the stage. My Lord, as Your Lordship knows, but just for the benefit, perhaps, of those behind us. The case concerns enforcement of a unanimous ICC arbitration award rendered in Paris by an eminent international tribunal, comprising Lord Michael Mustill, Dr Nassim Hasan Shah, former chief justice of Pakistan, and Dr Ghaleb Mahmassani, who's a Lebanese lawyer who was the chair. In 1995, Dallah, my clients proposed to the government of Pakistan the idea of providing housing in Mecca for pilgrims performing harsh. This in due course led to a memorandum of understanding on the 24th of July 1995 made between Dallah and the government and later on the 10th of September 1996 to the agreement the subject matter of this appeal. The agreement was on its face, stated to be made between Dallah and the trust, a state entity, the respondent. The government of Pakistan was not a signatory to the agreement, nor was it named as a party. Had it been, we would not be here today, the first issue before the tribunal and the focus of the English proceedings concerned whether or not the government was a party to the arbitration clause. In that agreement, the tribunal found on the law and on the facts that it was. It subsequently found the government to be a party to the underlying agreement and in Dallah's favour on liability and awarded it 18,000,900,7000 odd dollars in damages. Together with costs, the government did not waive jurisdiction before the arbitral tribunal and has asserted sovereign immunity. If, however, it is found to be a party to the arbitration agreement, it is deemed by virtue of Section 9 of the State Immunity at 1978 to have waived its immunity in relation to the arbitration proceedings that is different from enforcement against assets. Yes, Dallah obtained leave to enforce the award as a judgement of the English court. This was challenged by the government under Section 103(2)(b) of the 1996. This basis of the challenge being that it is not valid under the law to which the parties subjected it or failing any indication thereon under the law of the country where the award was made.
13	p2,00:48:30.630,00:51:57.500,spk_1,	True	Counsel: It is indeed. And this is from Walter Martin [inaudible] acting for the Government, Your attention is invited to your notice at the 29th of May, in respect of the above matter where our client is required to file its answer to the request for arbitration within 30 days. We wish to bring to your notice that our client has filed legal proceedings in Pakistan, which are pending in the court of Civil Judge First Class Islamabad and are fixed for hearing on the 13th of June 1998. The learner Judge has been pleased to grant an interim injunction pertaining to the dispute. Copy of the court order is attached for your information. And then draw attention to Section 35 of the Arbitration Act, No reference or award shall be rendered invalid by reason only the commencement of legal proceedings on the subject matter of reference, but when legal proceedings on the whole of the subject matter of the reference has been commenced between all parties to the reference, notice there are the arbitrator or umpire, all further proceedings in a pending reference shall, unless estoppel proceedings is granted, under Section 34 be invalid. In this section, the expression, parties to the reference, including any person claiming under any of the parties and litigating under the same title. And the point that, perhaps, is obvious in which the Tribunal made from this is of course, this is the first response to the request. It nowhere says that the respondent is not a party to the Agreement. What it says is we now have an injunction obtained, as it was, without notice from the Government, please do not go on with the arbitration. The next document is the next page, which is the 15th of August. The same lawyers also to the ICC, referring to two further notices, We wish to bring your kind notice that our client has already declined to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Arbitration. It may also be brought into your kind notice that our client does not and shall not submit to the jurisdiction of the ICC. Inter alia the following reasons. There's no contract or arbitration agreement between our parents and Dallah. The contract and arbitration agreement referred to by the claimant were entered into by the claimant, and the Trust. The Trust has already ceased to exist after expiry of the Ordinance. Clause 27 of the contract provides that the Trust may assign or transfer its rights and obligations to the Government without the prior consent in writing of Dallah. The Trust never assigned or transferred its rights and obligations. Contract was entered into and executed in Pakistan and under well established principles of law it's governed by the laws of Pakistan, hence the Arbitration Act is not applicable. Any award passed by the ICC will not be enforceable, being against the public policy and laws of Pakistan. Under Pakistan law, the application of the Protocol on Arbitration Clause's is limited to contracts which are considered as commercial under the law enforced in Pakistan. The contract in question was entered into for religious purposes to provide housing facilities to Pakistan pilgrims. Therefore, the laws of Pakistan don't recognise the protocol and arbitration clause's. Our client never agreed to make a submission to arbitration, and unilateral submission to arbitration by the claimant alone doesn't constitute actual submissions under the laws enforced in Pakistan.

13	p1,01:37:23.310,01:37:57.650,spk_2,	True	The Court: Your case, wasn't that different from inducement of breach of contract? Because, as I've understood it, the arbitral tribunal decided that the government was not the same as the trust but was nevertheless a party. And then it was held liable in the interim award for the government was held liable for repudiating the contract without it being said inside that it was, it was subject to the obligations of the trust. So that's quite that's not very, very far from inducement.
13	p6,00:50:06.100,00:51:09.880,spk_4,	True	The Court: Just dealing with the point you made a moment ago about looking at it at one moment. And it's sufficient if the moment is at the end. The fact is that during the 1998 proceedings, which I take it, you have among other things in mind, although the government of Pakistan's attitude was that it had become party to the agreement on the demise of the trust. Nonetheless, when it commenced the 1988 proceedings, its attitude was that it was no longer party to the agreement, let alone to an arbitration clause. And it was seeking in declaration and injunction on that basis so that viewing the fact that arbitration agreements, what we're talking about and autonomous it's a bit difficult to say that there was any common intention at that point to be a party to an arbitration agreement, how much your clients may have wanted the government of Pakistan to be.
13	p2,01:16:18.380,01:16:49.960,spk_1,	True	Counsel: This is in the core bundle, and its paragraph 6, which says, Arbitral [inaudible], as judicial case law, has widely recognised that in international arbitration, the effects of the arbitration clause may extend to parties that did not actually sign the main contract that they were directly involved in the negotiation and performance of such contract, such involvement raising the presumption that the common intention of all parties was that the non signatory party would be a true party to such contract and would be bound by the arbitration agreement.

But part of this also goes to the other aspect of common intention, if one reads, I've nearly finished, the defendant identified as the Ministry of Religious Affairs has been, in actual fact, the party that was involved -- deals with two grounds really, he deals with the alter ego. Then, he says, the Ministry was involved in the negotiation, implementation, and termination of the Agreement with the claimant from the first day that the housing project was contemplated until after the repudiation of such agreement. This was and remained true before, during, and after the existence of the Trust, with no change being notified in the role of the defendant whether during the lifetime of the Trust or after its elapsed. Such behaviour shows and proves the defendant has always been and considered itself to be a true party to the Agreement with the claimant and therefore to the arbitration agreements.

I don't think what you've assumed is the only possible analysis. The issue we have to grapple with is what makes better sense overall, and better, one interpretation overall is that the first set of proceedings were conducted on the basis that the Trust was party and the letter was written entirely consistently with that, when the judge, your client's instance struck them out on the basis that the Trust had, it was now pointed out that the Trust had ceased to exist, they, the Government, rather unwisely in response to the Paris proceedings, took up the idea that it might be able, might be regarded as a party, and could take a counter proceedings in Pakistan.

14	p2,01:39:00.570,01:40:55.820,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Under such judicial proceedings, the defendant in the second set of proceedings, the June 1998 suit, while alleging the Agreement with the plaintiff was no more binding because it's been repudiated, admitted thereby it was a party to such agreement and that it could accept a repudiation of the Agreement by the claimant. And then it deals with the Pakistan proceedings, if I go to 12, And the aforementioned close scrutiny of all the factual elements relating to the conduct of the defendant with regard to the negotiation, signature, implementation, and termination of the agreement as well as with regard to the establishment operation expiry of the Trust, it is clearly established that the Trust established by the defendant was assigned an object, formed part of the functions of the defendant, was organically and operationally under the strict control of defendant, moreover its financial and administrative dependence was largely theoretical because it didn't have any funds or assets of its own. And as all that concerned the Agreement with the claimant whether before or after signature, continued to be performed by the defendant concurrently with the Trust. Following the lapse of the Trust, the Trust functions that were originally discharged by the defendant, reverted back logically to this letter with all rights and obligations of the defunct Trust. The Trust, in spite of its distinct [inaudible] personality in theory, appears thus in fact and in conduct to have been considered to have acted as part of the division of the defendant to which it is fully assimilated. The temporary instrument has been created by a political decision of the defendant, the specific activities which the defendant wanted to perform and which was cancelled also by a political decision of the defendant. Therefore, the Trust seems to appear -- now this is the alter ego point -- have been no more than the alter ego of the defendant, which appears in substance as the real party and interest and therefore as the proper party to the agreement and the arbitration with the claimant.

14	p2,01:26:31.980,01:29:28.290,spk_1,	True	Counsel: This is common intention. I'm not going to read it all, My Lord, I'm just going to select points because a lot of it already, but just to summarise, I mean 8.1 deals with what happened and the introduction of which you are now familiar. If you go to 8.2, the tribunal makes the point having explained the overlap, and I'm using this as a neutral word because there isn't, we're not running the alter ego argument, but the overlap between what the Ministry of Religious Affairs does and what the Trust does, consequently, the defendant, by signing the MOU, was conducting an activity which falls normally within the functions entrusted to it by the applicable rules. At 8(3), Thereafter it was the defendant by an act of sovereignty, took the decision to establish the Trust on the 14th of February, pursuant to Section 3 of the Ordinance in exercise of powers conferred by Clause 1 of Article 89 of the constitution, which empowers the president to promulgate an ordinance when the national assembly is not in session. Next paragraph, It was the defendant that defined the objects of the Trust and determined the functions that were to be delegated to it, and that included the function of adopting measures for facilitating the performance of Hajj. Then it goes on to deal with the overlap of the functions dealt with by the Government and the Trust, and then 8.4, The organic control of the defendant over the Trust resulting from the Ordinance provisions regarding the composition of the board of the Trust, the Government's prerogatives as to certain functions, though insufficient to lead to the disregard of a separate legal entity of the Trust, as explained above here, constitutes nevertheless an element of evidence as to the true intention of the defendant to run and control directly, and indirectly the activities of the Trust. And this part is not open to me to view the Trust as one of its instruments because I'm not arguing alter ego. He then again goes through the various parts of the Ordinance which we've been through. 8.5, This conclusion is confirmed by the continuous involvement of the Government in the negotiations with the claimant, despite the establishment of the Trust in fact, before the signature of the Agreement and in spite of the recent establishment of the Trust on the 14th of February, all correspondence concerning the finalisation of the pending matters in the project continued to be exchanged with the Government itself, MORA, or Ministry of Finance, and not with the Trust. They then referred to a series of letters, page 30, The conduct of the defendant at the time of the signature -- 
14	p2,01:41:06.980,01:42:01.170,spk_1,	True	Counsel: It undermines that part of the plank. But part of this also goes to the other aspect of common intention, if one reads, I've nearly finished, the defendant identified as the Ministry of Religious Affairs has been, in actual fact, the party that was involved -- deals with two grounds really, he deals with the alter ego. Then, he says, the Ministry was involved in the negotiation, implementation, and termination of the Agreement with the claimant from the first day that the housing project was contemplated until after the repudiation of such agreement. This was and remained true before, during, and after the existence of the Trust, with no change being notified in the role of the defendant whether during the lifetime of the Trust or after its elapsed. Such behaviour shows and proves the defendant has always been and considered itself to be a true party to the Agreement with the claimant and therefore to the arbitration agreements.

14	p5,00:08:42.500,00:10:06.050,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I won't go into Section 33 but all the court needs to know, my submission is that this is a full -- a full hearing before the court, an application for a declaration that the government was never a party to the agreement. And it's not the successor of the trust that there's no privity of contract now. In my submission, what's what's relevant here, as was found by Mr Justice Aikens and the Court of Appeal is if you, as you have to do through French eyes, look at the full chronology from beginning to end, you've got the 1998 proceedings sandwiched between, it's a short period of time, sandwiched between 97 where it's the trust bringing a claim and then 99 where the government is saying we're not a party to any of this. If you take a reasonable fair view of that, you can't take that six month period, in my submission, as being an admission by the government that it is a party to the arbitration agreement. If nothing else, one can see reasonably why they acted in that way because the judge gave them a false lead, but also through French eyes. The test is whether it's subjective or objective. Were they -- are they to be taken as having accepted an arbitration clause. Well, in my submission, starting a court proceeding is a curious way of accepting an arbitration clause.

14	p6,00:50:06.100,00:51:09.880,spk_4,	True	The Court: Just dealing with the point you made a moment ago about looking at it at one moment. And it's sufficient if the moment is at the end. The fact is that during the 1998 proceedings, which I take it, you have among other things in mind, although the government of Pakistan's attitude was that it had become party to the agreement on the demise of the trust. Nonetheless, when it commenced the 1988 proceedings, its attitude was that it was no longer party to the agreement, let alone to an arbitration clause. And it was seeking in declaration and injunction on that basis so that viewing the fact that arbitration agreements, what we're talking about and autonomous it's a bit difficult to say that there was any common intention at that point to be a party to an arbitration agreement, how much your clients may have wanted the government of Pakistan to be.

14	p5,00:31:40.040,00:32:33.560,spk_0,	True	Counsel: What's difficult about the award, in my submission, is that the tribunal said that it was an accumulation of facts. So for them, the individual points in time were not enough. My learned friend relies upon the letter of termination and the latter part of the technology, but that wasn't enough for the tribunal. They said you had to read it altogether, but what did they read together? They read together a misconception of the previous facts, plus alter ego elements which have been abandoned. So if you strip away the parts of the tribunal's award that really are not admissible anymore or permissible. You're not left with enough for the result. And if you put on top of that, Lord Mustill's hesitation, he says, It's close to the line this confusion about good faith, which the chairman Mr Mahmassani uses to bolster to comfort his analysis. This is an award which, actually upon scrutiny, taking away alter ego and succession is not sustainable.
14	p2,01:56:32.430,01:57:08.500,spk_4,	True	The Court: Is there any evidence that it was your, I mean, I think you -- the difficulty I have about that, is that we're talking about common subjective intention, presumably at the same moment in time, and you're, you've accepted that in January 1997, Dallah thought that Trust continued to exist and so it, there's no evidence that it thought that the Government of Pakistan was party to that agreement at that date. It didn't allege that until 15 months later.
14	p2,00:27:57.940,00:31:29.300,spk_1,	True	Counsel: In the document that you're looking at, there is reference to the letter -- to the request for arbitration. The request for arbitration is clearly made against the Government and not against the Trust. The Court: Yep. Counsel: And what I'm saying is the sequences application following the letter of the 2016 January, which I'll come to in a second, where we had told the Government in response to their letter of the 20th --19th of January, we would issue proceedings. We did issue proceedings at the ICC against the Government. It was served on the Government. When the Government received it, they went off to the court having done nothing in the last three months and started the proceedings all over again. But this -- but they didn't mention, because it was an ex parte application, that in the interim they had actually received arbitration proceedings against them. We then come back in on notice and raise this point and that's where this comes. And the point being, again, that in order to fund these proceedings, because the proceedings could not -- it wasn't a cause of action without -- the letter was integral, and the contents of the letter were integral to the plaint in both the first, 1997 on the second, 1998. And what this does, at the very least, is that it cast doubt on what was going through the mind of Mr Lutfullah Mufti in 1997 which the judge places so much reliance upon. Because here's the same gentleman, now in a different scenario, saying something completely different. And we say, realistically, you cannot place all this weight on what happened in 1997. You have to look at it in the round. And it's not -- just as my learned friend without any evidence, tries to say, as I think Lord Clarke, it may be Lord Mance had said, Well, maybe Mr Lutfullah Mufti made a mistake. The same, you can also say, but here's a government, in effect taking using legal action tactically to ensure belt and braces that now having made sure that the Trust isn't a party, wants to make quite sure that Dallah, who, after all, are chasing them and responded in the subsequently in the letter to the Government to get on with it, don't try and make life difficult for the Government. And the easiest way is really a declaration of non-justiciability or whatever to say that's the end of it. And the Pakistan courts would then, they hope, say that there wasn't a contract and the Government would then be clear of it. The Court: Yes. Counsel: So, we say, therefore, that the 1997 proceedings cannot be as cast iron as Mr Justice Aikens said. You have to, under the French test, look at the whole scenario. You can't stop in 1997. You will have to go on to 1998. 
15	p1,00:05:55.910,00:08:20.215,spk_0,	True	Counsel: That was the only point I was making at the stage. My Lord, as Your Lordship knows, but just for the benefit, perhaps, of those behind us. The case concerns enforcement of a unanimous ICC arbitration award rendered in Paris by an eminent international tribunal, comprising Lord Michael Mustill, Dr Nassim Hasan Shah, former chief justice of Pakistan, and Dr Ghaleb Mahmassani, who's a Lebanese lawyer who was the chair. In 1995, Dallah, my clients proposed to the government of Pakistan the idea of providing housing in Mecca for pilgrims performing harsh. This in due course led to a memorandum of understanding on the 24th of July 1995 made between Dallah and the government and later on the 10th of September 1996 to the agreement the subject matter of this appeal. The agreement was on its face, stated to be made between Dallah and the trust, a state entity, the respondent. The government of Pakistan was not a signatory to the agreement, nor was it named as a party. Had it been, we would not be here today, the first issue before the tribunal and the focus of the English proceedings concerned whether or not the government was a party to the arbitration clause. In that agreement, the tribunal found on the law and on the facts that it was. It subsequently found the government to be a party to the underlying agreement and in Dallah's favour on liability and awarded it 18,000,900,7000 odd dollars in damages. Together with costs, the government did not waive jurisdiction before the arbitral tribunal and has asserted sovereign immunity. If, however, it is found to be a party to the arbitration agreement, it is deemed by virtue of Section 9 of the State Immunity at 1978 to have waived its immunity in relation to the arbitration proceedings that is different from enforcement against assets. Yes, Dallah obtained leave to enforce the award as a judgement of the English court. This was challenged by the government under Section 103(2)(b) of the 1996. This basis of the challenge being that it is not valid under the law to which the parties subjected it or failing any indication thereon under the law of the country where the award was made.

15	p2,00:57:04.950,00:57:32.550,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Well it's because of that, and because of what French law says, because what is said is that because I have agreed that the law by which this again arbitration clause has to be determined is French law, when the tribunal were looking at it, they were determining the issue or be it the common intention is the same boat, by a different law. And therefore you can't say that they were carrying out the same exercise.

15	p5,00:04:49.890,00:06:46.890,spk_0,	True	Counsel: They belie the case that Dallah's putting that somehow this was an admission by the government because it records firstly in paragraph 2 that the trust has lapsed because of exercise of paragraph 89 of the Pakistan Constitution. The four month period had passed, so they record, firstly, that the trust has gone. And then in paragraph 14 of the complaint, the government states that -- sorry that it records its 1997 proceedings that were brought by the trust. And then it records what the judge said, which is that actually, this is a claim that should be brought could be brought in the name of the government because the trust had gone. And the reason I stressed those paragraph's is that again, that's an indication of what the government was intending in 1998. Not that it's now agreed it was a party, but it was taking up this invitation from the judge. Those 1998 proceedings are very significant for Dallah's case, as Your Lordships will be aware, because they put their focus on the latter part of the chronology accepting they have difficulties with the MOU and the agreement, they say, Well, look what happened afterwards through the French test. So the 98 proceedings are important, but these are they were short lived. They were only alive for six months, which is short in the scheme of Pakistan legal proceedings. They were then withdrawn. In my submission, you can take a fair view as to why they were instituted because there was a knee jerk reaction to the ICC arbitration and because a judge had just told the government that they could actually commence proceedings. They were withdrawn in January 1999 on or about 14th, 14th of January. The reference for that the court order is bundle e tab b.10 page 47. On the same day that the 98 proceedings were withdrawn, the third set of proceedings were commenced by the government. These are the 1999 Pakistan regime's.
15	p2,01:17:41.190,01:18:52.940,spk_1,	True	Counsel: In fact, the tribunal, you will see, go on to expand upon that, And then when he's read it is that the correct test that would be applied by a French court by way of common intention, the case or matter such as this. It is the general principle. Yes, And then I understand there is a difference here between, the weight [pause], so there's two passages there where he, it is accepted by the expert for the Government that the correct test was generally applied. The one other point, while you have that bundle open, if you would just go, because the point that was made earlier about coming into, as a party, late in the day. And if you look at Mr Durand's [inaudible] evidence at page 131, you might, and this was because Mr Durand was cross-examined and Mr Landau said, I want to move on -- do you have it My Lords?
15	p1,00:12:08.460,00:14:05.850,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I will do my best. So, My Lord, before I do that though, I would just like to reiterate briefly the French test, which I said in a sentence a moment ago. For your note, the summary of French law is set out in paragraph 49 of our case at pages 20, starts at paragraph 49, pages 22 to 25 a more detailed exposition is that paragraphs 85 to 96 of Mr Justice Aikens’ judgment. But if I can just paraphrase it and I hope there is a little between us on this, essentially in order to determine whether an arbitration clause upon which the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal is founded extends to a personal party who is neither a named party nor a signatory to the underlying agreement containing that clause, it's necessary to ascertain whether all the parties to the arbitration proceedings had the common intention, whether express or implied, to be bound by the agreement and hence the arbitration agreement. Or, to put it another way, that the non signatory was aware of the arbitration clause and accepted its terms. Under French law, this common intention is determined in the light of the facts of the case, starting at the beginning of the chronology and going on to the end looking at the facts in the round, including considering the involvement and behaviour of all the parties during the negotiation, performance and, if applicable, termination of the underlying agreement, and the court seeks to ascertain the subjective intentions of the parties through their objective conduct. In other words, if you behave as a party, that is objective, an objective piece of conduct that can be deemed to indicate that you intended to be a party.

15	p4,01:39:05.210,01:39:52.010,spk_2,	True	Counsel: The factual record does need to be looked at, but I will do so very briefly. But the characteristic feature of this case, which was found by Mr Justice Aikens and by the Court of Appeal, was that this is a case not just where the government of Pakistan never consented to arbitration, unlike the Svenska case, but similar to the Pyramids case in France. In this case, the government made positive steps not to be bound. It interposed a trust with separate legal personality. It's very difficult in those circumstances to divine a common intention, subjective intention, for it to be bound.
15	p1,00:18:51.480,00:20:03.480,spk_0,	True	Counsel: I don't think there's any dispute that the judge applied the right test in the sense that he used the right test was his application of the facts to the Fre' -- using the French test, which is the difference between the way the tribunal did it and the way he did it. I'm not criticising his formulation of the French law. But what I am saying is that applying French law, the test of common intention, which, as Lord Colin says, is the same and transnational law, the test of common intention, both in effect, applied the same test. But when looking at the facts of the case, the judge took a different view largely on one letter from the tribunal. And what we say is in those circumstances where there's no new evidence, one has to look very carefully as to whether an English court is right in coming in and completely effectively ignoring. Although obviously read the tribunal's decision coming to a different conclusion on the facts of that case.

The question for your purposes, under the French test that the other side rely upon, is if this is the intention at this point, why does it change? There's got to be a confluence of intentions, common intentions, Dallah at this point is intending the Trust to be the party. Why does that change later?

That's why I've sought to introduce these further authorities. And what I'm doing with these authorities is making good my distinction between French law with that substantive law element law of, and unconstrained transnational law.

It was part of the Islamic financing, and that was the structure with the government had agreed as the means of achieving the objective of providing housing for the pilgrims. My Lord, as I said, I accept entirely that, and I must deal with it, even though it is perhaps not in my favour, it's only right that I should take you through this. So I was just at four. That Dallah will develop construct, complete the housing in accordance with the detailed specifications. Just one point to note because it becomes relevant later, is that there is no obligation, as I said, to send the specifications at this stage simply that they need to be approved by the trust. 5(a), the trust irrevocably and unconditionally agreed to take on the lease return of 99 years. Then 5(c) agreed between the parties upon the execution of the lease agreement. The advanced lease payments would be a portion as payment for the entire period of the lease. In respect of such portion, the leased premises provides accommodation 12,000 pilgrims. And then there's a provision which perhaps I can just summarise whereby you can pay less by paying earlier rather than wait for the whole of the 99 year period to elapse. And then other clauses I need take you to I can jump, I think the rest is just dealing with the mechanics. Page 198, 19.

Counsel: It is the defendant that decided to delegate to the Trust, the finalisation, signature, and implementation of the Agreement with the claimant, which the defendant and negotiated pursuant the MOU of July 1995, which appeared to be the main purpose for the establishment of the Trust. It said, It was signed by the Minister of Religious affairs, acting as chairman of the board. It refers to the successive promulgations. At 9(2) the defendant was contractually involved in the Agreement as the Government was bound under Article 2 to give its guarantee for the financial facility to be raised. The point I made earlier, that the guarantee was not a guarantee of its performance, but it was the trigger to enable the finance and the whole contract to begin. And at Article 27 of the Agreement, It was authorised to assign its rights and obligations to the Government, i.e. to the defendant, without the prior approval of the claimant. Such a clause is normally used only when the assignee is very closely linked to the assignor or is under its total control through ownership, management, or otherwise. Then the period of performance, During the lifetime of the Agreement, the defendant continued to handle matters relating to the Agreement signed by the Trust and to act to conduct itself in a way that confirmed that it regarded the Agreement as its own. And then it deals with beside the exercise of the regulatory powers, undertake -- officials of the defendant continue to be actively involved in the implementation of the Agreement, as they were previously in negotiation. Refers to the two letters of 26th of September 1996, and 4th of November, that was, those were the two letters I showed you relating to the implementation of rules for the funds which had been set up, and it's right that they had in fact been set up by the Trust. And it then, at 10(2), although the Trust enjoyed, under the Ordinance, legal and financial independence and capacity to own property and assets, and to dispose thereof it does not appear from the actual facts, as submitted by the parties, that the Trust effectively had any funds or assets of its own during its short lifetime, there's no evidence of any schemes or plans made to raise funds and to mobilise pilgrim's savings, nor of any transactions made and implemented by the Trust for the purpose of generating funds to finance its activities. Apparently, it seems as if the only activity conducted by the Trust was the signature of the Agreement with the claimant, with the implementation being followed up by the Ministry of Religious Affairs itself and as if the Trust was not given the human and financial means that could have enabled it to exercise fully its functions as an autonomous legal entity, and has therefore remained as an empty shell with all effective powers being exercised by the defendant itself. It was the Government which decided by a discretionary act or omission not to remit, promulgate the Ordinance, the end of four months from the date of its second re-promulgation, and therefore to put an end to the Trust on the 12th of December 1996 pursuant to the repeal of the Ordinance as a result of its non re-promulgation. The very existence of the Trust appears thus been depending merely on an attitude of non-action by the Government, demonstrating the fragile existence of the Trust, and it's complete dependability upon the Government, even for its own life. And then it refers to the letter of January 1997, and summarises the letter in the first paragraph on page 32. The second paragraph, such letter is very significant because it confirmed, in the clearest way possible, that the defendant, after the elapse of the Trust, regarded the Agreement with the claimant as its own and considered itself as a party to such agreement and, as such, was entitled to exercise all rights and assume more responsibilities provided for under such agreement.
16	p2,01:26:31.980,01:29:28.290,spk_1,	True	Counsel: This is common intention. I'm not going to read it all, My Lord, I'm just going to select points because a lot of it already, but just to summarise, I mean 8.1 deals with what happened and the introduction of which you are now familiar. If you go to 8.2, the tribunal makes the point having explained the overlap, and I'm using this as a neutral word because there isn't, we're not running the alter ego argument, but the overlap between what the Ministry of Religious Affairs does and what the Trust does, consequently, the defendant, by signing the MOU, was conducting an activity which falls normally within the functions entrusted to it by the applicable rules. At 8(3), Thereafter it was the defendant by an act of sovereignty, took the decision to establish the Trust on the 14th of February, pursuant to Section 3 of the Ordinance in exercise of powers conferred by Clause 1 of Article 89 of the constitution, which empowers the president to promulgate an ordinance when the national assembly is not in session. Next paragraph, It was the defendant that defined the objects of the Trust and determined the functions that were to be delegated to it, and that included the function of adopting measures for facilitating the performance of Hajj. Then it goes on to deal with the overlap of the functions dealt with by the Government and the Trust, and then 8.4, The organic control of the defendant over the Trust resulting from the Ordinance provisions regarding the composition of the board of the Trust, the Government's prerogatives as to certain functions, though insufficient to lead to the disregard of a separate legal entity of the Trust, as explained above here, constitutes nevertheless an element of evidence as to the true intention of the defendant to run and control directly, and indirectly the activities of the Trust. And this part is not open to me to view the Trust as one of its instruments because I'm not arguing alter ego. He then again goes through the various parts of the Ordinance which we've been through. 8.5, This conclusion is confirmed by the continuous involvement of the Government in the negotiations with the claimant, despite the establishment of the Trust in fact, before the signature of the Agreement and in spite of the recent establishment of the Trust on the 14th of February, all correspondence concerning the finalisation of the pending matters in the project continued to be exchanged with the Government itself, MORA, or Ministry of Finance, and not with the Trust. They then referred to a series of letters, page 30, The conduct of the defendant at the time of the signature -- 
16	p1,00:29:54.050,00:33:52.600,spk_0,	True	Counsel: It's useful just to see this because this is at the start of the story and it's written to His Excellency Ministry for Hajj. We're taking the opportunity to write, to you about a very special situation has arisen in Saudi Arabia, which will prove to be an enormous benefit for the government and the people of Pakistan. He then goes on to say the king of Saudi Arabia and the custodian of the holy places has given the task of maintenance to the Dallah Albaraka group and due to this, we've been closely involved in the development and expansion of the holy cities. As part of this development, new regulations coming into effect, the group has been allowed to offer to selected Muslim governments housing complexes in Mecca and Medina for 55 year leases. As you maybe aware, the government of Pakistan rents housing in Mecca each year for the Hajj, and every year there's a problem. The acquisition of these sites will eliminate this problem for a period of 55 years would also result in considerable cost savings for the government of Pakistan and therefore they make the proposal. And in the end, last paragraph in closing, We'd like to add it's a unique opportunity for Pakistan and we hope we'll be able to assist more Pakistan Muslims in performing their religious obligations and earn the blessing of God Almighty. And then they asked to make a detailed presentation. So that's how it starts and we without taking you through all the documents. It's quite clear both from the documentary evidence and from the statement of Mr Naqvi that senior members of the government and ministers. As I said from the prime minister downwards, the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance were all involved throughout the whole project and the government's approval was required at every step of the way and in relation to every aspect of the deal. Its approval was required in relation to the least and the financial plan. The Pakistani ambassador viewed the potential for sites in Mecca and the government had input into the site chosen. The detailed specifications and drawings were approved by the government and even after the agreement to which the government was not a signatory, had been signed, Mr Naqvi explains that all his dealings were with members of the government. Now the structure of the deal, as evidence of by the agreement arose because it was a means whereby the government could finance the project consistently with Islamic principles. And the ultimate structure was an Islamic finance lease because, as you know, under Islamic principles, you can't claimed interest. And it enabled also the government to obtain dollars outside Pakistan at a time when its currency had devalued by approximately 15% and there were foreign exchange issues, so that's what underlined it. And the essence of the deal in our submission didn't change. It was simply the manner in which it was to be fine. Mr. Naqvi explains that there were two options. Either the government could divert its own borrowed funds, or Dallah could raise funds by way of a facility backed by a government guarantee. And you see, that real note is paragraph 46 of Mr Nafis witness statements. So we now come to the first agreement, which is the memorandum of understanding, and that is dated. Perhaps I just before I do that. Let me just take you to, Page 19 as an example of what I was saying, which is a letter of the 15th of July 1995, Financing proposal hajj housing.

16	p2,01:39:00.570,01:40:55.820,spk_1,	True	Counsel: Under such judicial proceedings, the defendant in the second set of proceedings, the June 1998 suit, while alleging the Agreement with the plaintiff was no more binding because it's been repudiated, admitted thereby it was a party to such agreement and that it could accept a repudiation of the Agreement by the claimant. And then it deals with the Pakistan proceedings, if I go to 12, And the aforementioned close scrutiny of all the factual elements relating to the conduct of the defendant with regard to the negotiation, signature, implementation, and termination of the agreement as well as with regard to the establishment operation expiry of the Trust, it is clearly established that the Trust established by the defendant was assigned an object, formed part of the functions of the defendant, was organically and operationally under the strict control of defendant, moreover its financial and administrative dependence was largely theoretical because it didn't have any funds or assets of its own. And as all that concerned the Agreement with the claimant whether before or after signature, continued to be performed by the defendant concurrently with the Trust. Following the lapse of the Trust, the Trust functions that were originally discharged by the defendant, reverted back logically to this letter with all rights and obligations of the defunct Trust. The Trust, in spite of its distinct [inaudible] personality in theory, appears thus in fact and in conduct to have been considered to have acted as part of the division of the defendant to which it is fully assimilated. The temporary instrument has been created by a political decision of the defendant, the specific activities which the defendant wanted to perform and which was cancelled also by a political decision of the defendant. Therefore, the Trust seems to appear -- now this is the alter ego point -- have been no more than the alter ego of the defendant, which appears in substance as the real party and interest and therefore as the proper party to the agreement and the arbitration with the claimant.

I'm directed to state the proposal submitted to you on behalf of Dallah, regarding selection of the Trustee Bank and development of Mecca housing project were considered in the following decisions were taken.

It's been decided to appoint Albaraka Islamic Investment Bank as the trustee bank and permit the bank to use its subsidiary all Tofik to carry out functions of the trustee bank on its behalf Mecca Housing Project. The plan be given in your letter of the 29th of February, which we saw is accepted subject to the following conditions and modification. The trustee bank will mobilise savings both in rupee and dollar. The saving mobilised abroad will be utilised towards payment of $245 million while the savings mobilised in Pakistan will not be transferred outside Pakistan accept the payment of expenses of Hajj when they are actually proceeding to perform Hajj and then it deals with the position where it's not possible to defray the cost of construction from the dollar savings and then two land as well as buildings are leased out to and at this stage it's still government of Pakistan slash Hajj trust in 99 years over the page construction plan already submitted and this becomes relevant with the proposal furnished in 1995 will be adopted so that the plans previously submitted will be adopted on the basis of land measuring 22,000 square metres with construction era of 336,000 square metres and then five Proposal regarding arrangement of 100 million foreign currency loan at interest margin of 2.5% per year and 12 months libel or fixed interest of 8.75% per year.

It is, of course, governed by Saudi law. And there's no evidence before you as to the effect of Clause 3. Secondly, the Lease and Financing workforce plan were sent the following month. Dallah purchased the land and acquired it on the 18th of November, i.e after the expiry. According to Clause 3, Dallah sent the drawings and specifications which were only do after the approval date, and these were approved and they were also approved according to the evidence of Mr Naqvi on the 30th of July. So when one looks also at some of the correspondence, it's quite clear that the parties were still negotiating. And so whether it in practice lapsed as or whether or not the parties continue to work on under, it may, in a sense, be academic. The fact is, for the next few months, the parties were negotiating the financial structure and the financial deal, and the agreement therefore implemented the MOU consistently with the framework. But obviously with some changes.

Thus, Trust established under the ordinance ceased to exist with effect 12th December 1996 and all of its office bearers, including the secretary of the Board of Trust i.e., secretary of Ministry of Religious Affairs, also ceased to have any authority to act for and on behalf of the Trust. The letter, dated the 19th of January 1997 written by the Secretary Ministry of Religious Affairs and addressed to the claimant, was therefore absolutely unauthorised, illegal and of no effect.
17	p2,00:13:55.940,00:16:46.750,spk_1,	True	Counsel: So, on the second of June, some three months later, having done nothing, the Government brings identical proceedings to the 1997 proceedings seeking identical relief, changing some of the wording which is consistent with the change of plaintiff. And so again, if you go to flag B1, you see the plaintiff name changes. At paragraph 1, the Trust was a body corporate the Secretary of Religious Affairs government of Pakistan was the Secretary constituted under Section 5. Then 2, that under Article 89 the aforesaid Ordinance stood lapse on expiry of four months from the date of its promulgation. As such, the Trust established no longer remained in field. The present suit is, therefore, being filed by Pakistan who issued the said Ordinance. And then if you jump to 6, The parties, the party now, of course, being the Government, entered into an agreement dated the 10th of September at Islamabad. 7, to be effective as from the date, the defendant receives, again, the advanced lease payment from the Trust and submits the requisite performance bond in the terms of the Agreement. But as per Clause 2, and you can see it's a scissors and paste job, the plaintiff Trust was required to pay a lump sum. 9, that the payment of the above mentioned advanced by the plaintiff i.e. the GOP not the plaintiff Trust in this case. But if you jump to 11, it's perhaps the clearest. Under Clause 4 of the Agreement, the defendant was also under an obligation to submit detailed specifications and drawings of the Makkah housing project, but the defendant complied -- failed to comply with this fundamental term of the Agreement which tantamount to a repudiation of the whole agreement which repudiation was accordingly accepted by the plaintiff. On this case, the plaintiff is the Government in its letter of the 19th of January 1997, and that on account of the repudiation of the Agreement, the same is no longer binding on the plaintiff, the Government, and the defendant is not entitled to raise any claim. And in 14, that in January 1997 refers to the Trust instituting a suit was, however, dismissed the order of the 24th of February, and sets out the grounds, and then over the page, The learned Civil Court observed, however, that liabilities and duties against the defendant can be agitated by the Government of Pakistan. That the cause of action accrued to the plaintiff against the defendant at Islamabad. Firstly, when the defendant, the Government, entered into the Agreement and thereafter when it defaulted in fulfilling the preconditions of the agreement, and the same was repudiated.

There's no actual evidence before the court as to why they were launched in Pakistan in the name of defunct the trust. The only facts that we know are one that I mentioned that Mr Naqvi was chasing members of the government, two the a secretary of MORA changed after the change of government. Mr. Lutfullah Mufti became its secretary. And you've seen the dates. The proceedings rely on the letter in order to assert an alleged acceptance to an alleged repudiation and the proceedings sought a declaration that the agreement was repudiated and sought an injunction. So the letter was integral to the ability to bring the proceedings and again whilst you can, because there is no evidence whilst, yes, one way of looking at it is as the judge said, Well, this is the clearest indication as to why the government did what it did. On the other hand, one could take a more cynical view and say that this was a tactic on the part of the government to bring proceedings in order belt and braces, to make sure that there would be no proceedings against the new government for something which had been undertaken by a previous administration.

This agreement should be settled by arbitration held under the ICC rules by three arbitrators in Paris by three arbitrators appointed under rules. And then you have an immunity clause waiver of immunity and you will see that the last two sentences appear to be in this one. It's the same as the last clause, but added after whether or not claimed, trust hereby irrevocably agrees not to claim and hereby irrevocably waived such immunity to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction. 25, trust waives any objection now here after the sighting of the venue of the arbitration 26 deals with enforcement. 27. The trust may assign or transfer rights and obligations under this agreement to the government of Pakistan without the prior consent. In writing of Dallah and then over the page, you have Mr Kadwai, the managing trustee of the trust and also at this time secretary of MORA, who signs on behalf of the trust.

Obviously, it is clearly based on the letter because the letter gives the cause of action. The Court: Yes. Counsel: And, secondly, what is being sought, effectively, is an order to say, not only, a declaration that there are no contractual relations with the plaintiff and an injunction. Remembering, of course, that at this stage, Dallah has in fact done nothing other than write the letter of the 20th of November, asking the Government what's happening about the financing. And you get a similar document, suit for declaration, in tab 2 number 5, pending the decision of the suit, if the respondent is not restrained from representing or holding out that the applicant has any contractual relationship with it, the applicant would suffer an irreparable loss unspecified. And then, if you go to 4, you have Mr Muhammad Lutfullah being Secretary Board of Trustees Awami Trust, slash Secretary Religious Affairs Division government of Pakistan, to hereby take oath and state as follows, read the application moved under Section 151, this is by Dallah, I'm fully conversant the facts of the case into the reply had been prepared under my instructions. The facts stated in the aforementioned reply are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. The allegations made in the affidavit against Awami Trust absolutely fall from the same vehemently denied. The facts stated in the plaint are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief, and the same are reiterated.
17	p2,00:27:57.940,00:31:29.300,spk_1,	True	Counsel: In the document that you're looking at, there is reference to the letter -- to the request for arbitration. The request for arbitration is clearly made against the Government and not against the Trust. The Court: Yep. Counsel: And what I'm saying is the sequences application following the letter of the 2016 January, which I'll come to in a second, where we had told the Government in response to their letter of the 20th --19th of January, we would issue proceedings. We did issue proceedings at the ICC against the Government. It was served on the Government. When the Government received it, they went off to the court having done nothing in the last three months and started the proceedings all over again. But this -- but they didn't mention, because it was an ex parte application, that in the interim they had actually received arbitration proceedings against them. We then come back in on notice and raise this point and that's where this comes. And the point being, again, that in order to fund these proceedings, because the proceedings could not -- it wasn't a cause of action without -- the letter was integral, and the contents of the letter were integral to the plaint in both the first, 1997 on the second, 1998. And what this does, at the very least, is that it cast doubt on what was going through the mind of Mr Lutfullah Mufti in 1997 which the judge places so much reliance upon. Because here's the same gentleman, now in a different scenario, saying something completely different. And we say, realistically, you cannot place all this weight on what happened in 1997. You have to look at it in the round. And it's not -- just as my learned friend without any evidence, tries to say, as I think Lord Clarke, it may be Lord Mance had said, Well, maybe Mr Lutfullah Mufti made a mistake. The same, you can also say, but here's a government, in effect taking using legal action tactically to ensure belt and braces that now having made sure that the Trust isn't a party, wants to make quite sure that Dallah, who, after all, are chasing them and responded in the subsequently in the letter to the Government to get on with it, don't try and make life difficult for the Government. And the easiest way is really a declaration of non-justiciability or whatever to say that's the end of it. And the Pakistan courts would then, they hope, say that there wasn't a contract and the Government would then be clear of it. The Court: Yes. Counsel: So, we say, therefore, that the 1997 proceedings cannot be as cast iron as Mr Justice Aikens said. You have to, under the French test, look at the whole scenario. You can't stop in 1997. You will have to go on to 1998. 
17	p2,01:29:29.610,01:33:37.730,spk_1,	True	The Court: Are they all in the bundle? Counsel: I believe they're all, and I think they were only an example. The Court: Yes, right. Counsel: It is the defendant that decided to delegate to the Trust, the finalisation, signature, and implementation of the Agreement with the claimant, which the defendant and negotiated pursuant the MOU of July 1995, which appeared to be the main purpose for the establishment of the Trust. It said, It was signed by the Minister of Religious affairs, acting as chairman of the board. It refers to the successive promulgations. At 9(2) the defendant was contractually involved in the Agreement as the Government was bound under Article 2 to give its guarantee for the financial facility to be raised. The point I made earlier, that the guarantee was not a guarantee of its performance, but it was the trigger to enable the finance and the whole contract to begin. And at Article 27 of the Agreement, It was authorised to assign its rights and obligations to the Government, i.e. to the defendant, without the prior approval of the claimant. Such a clause is normally used only when the assignee is very closely linked to the assignor or is under its total control through ownership, management, or otherwise. Then the period of performance, During the lifetime of the Agreement, the defendant continued to handle matters relating to the Agreement signed by the Trust and to act to conduct itself in a way that confirmed that it regarded the Agreement as its own. And then it deals with beside the exercise of the regulatory powers, undertake -- officials of the defendant continue to be actively involved in the implementation of the Agreement, as they were previously in negotiation. Refers to the two letters of 26th of September 1996, and 4th of November, that was, those were the two letters I showed you relating to the implementation of rules for the funds which had been set up, and it's right that they had in fact been set up by the Trust. And it then, at 10(2), although the Trust enjoyed, under the Ordinance, legal and financial independence and capacity to own property and assets, and to dispose thereof it does not appear from the actual facts, as submitted by the parties, that the Trust effectively had any funds or assets of its own during its short lifetime, there's no evidence of any schemes or plans made to raise funds and to mobilise pilgrim's savings, nor of any transactions made and implemented by the Trust for the purpose of generating funds to finance its activities. Apparently, it seems as if the only activity conducted by the Trust was the signature of the Agreement with the claimant, with the implementation being followed up by the Ministry of Religious Affairs itself and as if the Trust was not given the human and financial means that could have enabled it to exercise fully its functions as an autonomous legal entity, and has therefore remained as an empty shell with all effective powers being exercised by the defendant itself. It was the Government which decided by a discretionary act or omission not to remit, promulgate the Ordinance, the end of four months from the date of its second re-promulgation, and therefore to put an end to the Trust on the 12th of December 1996 pursuant to the repeal of the Ordinance as a result of its non re-promulgation. The very existence of the Trust appears thus been depending merely on an attitude of non-action by the Government, demonstrating the fragile existence of the Trust, and it's complete dependability upon the Government, even for its own life. And then it refers to the letter of January 1997, and summarises the letter in the first paragraph on page 32. The second paragraph, such letter is very significant because it confirmed, in the clearest way possible, that the defendant, after the elapse of the Trust, regarded the Agreement with the claimant as its own and considered itself as a party to such agreement and, as such, was entitled to exercise all rights and assume more responsibilities provided for under such agreement.

We're not in a position to verify that, but I'm happy for present purposes to accept it as accurate. The position of the Secretary of MORA was held by Mr Mufti between the 26th of August and the 19th of December. So that was before the agreement. But after the MOU and between the 23rd of December and the third of June 1998 and in between, it was held by Mr Kidwai.

I've now read the application made on behalf of and in the name of the trust in the Pakistani courts on the 20th of January in relation to the repudiation of the agreement and the other documents filed in the name of the trust in these proceedings, and I realised that the statement was incorrect. It appears from these documents that the letter of the 19th of January was in fact written by Mr Lutfullah Mufti in his capacity as secretary of the board of trustees and or managing trustee of trust. The fact that the judge said it couldn't be in the name of on behalf of the trust. To this extent, paragraph 15 of my first witness statement is hereby corrected and should now read as follows.

17	p2,01:33:46.560,01:35:42.240,spk_1,	True	Counsel: I think it must be, yes. But he explained why. It's significant also to note in this respect, the defendant's position in these arbitration proceedings, regarding the letter of the 19th of January, did not deal with the substance of contents of such letter, but was rather limited to a formal and very general challenge of the validity of said letter on the ground that such letter was absolutely unauthorised, illegal, and of no effect, because all office bearers of the Trust, including the secretary, had ceased to have any authority to act for the defunct trust, such challenge is, however completely unfounded as the signatory of the letter of the 19th of January 1997, Mr Lutfullah Mufti did not sign such letter in his capacity as official for the Trust, to which, anyway, the letter makes no reference at all, but in his capacity as secretary of the defendant, the Ministry of Religious Affairs, which is an integral part of the Government of Pakistan. As such, the signatory of the letter engages and binds the Government as he has continued to bind it during the whole previous period where the Trust was in existence. In consequence, the signature of the said letter by the secretary of defendant may only be explained and construed as another evidence of confirmation that the defendant considered itself a party to the Agreement, exercising the rights and assuming the responsibilities thereunder. The fact is the more significant because after the elapse of the Trust, the defendant could have remained silent and have abstained from any involvement with regard to the Agreement signed with the claimant on the ground that it was not a party to such agreement and therefore was not concerned by it.

That is, as to whether there is a valid arbitration agreement, whether the tribunal is properly constituted and what matters have been submitted to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement, and that by Section 82 is stated to be the meaning of substantive jurisdiction. So the point of these comments is that if jurisdiction is based on consent, which I think everybody in this room agrees upon, such consent is not confined to what my learned friend calls the a priori situation but it could also be a situation where there is the tribunal is constituted but takes upon itself something which the parties had not agreed that it would determine.

If I can just have another stab, there are various ways you could put it. But another formulation is that the review relates to whether or not the government has proved that the government has to prove a negative, that it didn't consent to arbitration and whether in the exercise of the discretion, the court should refuse to enforce the award. Where we part company with the formulation of the government is that in considering this issue, the court must, not may consider the award and its reasoning and findings and must give such weight is appropriate in the circumstances of the case in hand to that award as a piece of evidence, together with the other evidential mix and the other factors in the case. And it cannot be a just as in an appeal. It cannot be an absolutely rigid situation because you will have a variety of different types of situations that will arise. There will be cases where there is a compelling new evidence to give you example in a completely different context. The case of Kanoria, which is a procedural issue. The tribunal went ahead and heard a case where new points were made at the hearing, where the responded unfortunately was severely ill and didn't have an opportunity to present his case. And it was late in the in the enforcement hearing that it became apparent that he had not had this opportunity and that new points have been put at the hearing. And in that case, it was the only case where the New York Convention had not been set aside. The gentleman had cancer and had been ill for over a year. Lord Phillips. I think that was the judge said that there would be severe injustice, and clearly this was a case where there was new evidence which indicated a completely different state of affairs.

I'm not taking you to the model law or the English or the French position as set out in the case just before, finally, just want to make a few brief comments on the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdictions. Let me make it clear that we accept that the tribunal is not the final arbiter of its own jurisdiction. It is subject to review being described as by Gaillard Chronological review, and it can happen at various stages. It could happen by way of a preliminary ruling under Article 16(3) of the model law or Section 32 in this country. It can happen by way of setting aside, and it can happen at the enforcement stage. But there is an important, vital distinction to be made between the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction, which is the jurisdiction to determine whether or not that tribunal has substantive jurisdiction. In other words, to go on hearing the merits and the kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction itself. And the conclusion of an exercise of a kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction may be right, or it may be wrong. But that tribunal, pursuant to that kompetenz-kompetenz jurisdiction still in our submission has jurisdiction to make the wrong decision. I may be wrong, and it can be set aside or it can not be enforced. But it doesn't undermine the initial entitlement of the arbitrators to make that decision. And that decision again, even if right or wrong remains binding, it may not be enforced because it's wrong, but as a partial award in this case, it is a binding award because the convention recognises, as does the English statute, partial awards.

I mean, I can see that if you've got an arbitration body, one would give particular attention to their view as to whether an issue was within their powers. But as a matter of logic, if an issue arose under Article 5(1)(c) as to whether the award dealt with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, as a matter of logic, it's difficult to see why the court's approach to that should be any different from its approach to question whether there is a valid arbitration agreement at all. And the issue is, essentially, whether there's a valid arbitration agreement covering what was decided, and that should be an issue which a party is entitled to come to court to argue and have decided.

55	p3,00:32:18.920,00:33:29.560,spk_3,	True	JUDGE: If there is no agreement, then the only logical consequence, although an enforcing court, can't declare it of a decision by an enforcing court not to enforce on the ground that there's no agreement, is that there is no binding arbitral award and actually that will normally give rise to an issue estoppel in every other enforcing court. If common law principles apply there or Article 3 isn't saying that invalid documents are binding arbitral awards. What this is enunciating is a general principle that arbitral awards are binding if they are made, of course, subject to a valid arbitration agreement. And all that we said in Dardana v Yukos was that the onus is on the person resisting enforcement to prove that something which is apparently a valid and binding arbitration award is not because there was no binding agreement and the onus arises from Article 4.

55	p3,00:18:52.490,00:20:06.330,spk_3,	True	JUDGE: Yes. I mean, I don't understand the difficulty, really. It seems obvious that if someone is appointed to decide almost anything that person or body can consider whether they are properly appointed and have jurisdiction to decide whatever is there are some decide to elevate that further seems perhaps unnecessary. But perhaps the more important point is this doesn't seem to support the proposition that a partial award on jurisdiction is an award subject to the New York Convention. And if it were, I mean, why wouldn't it be bounding? Because your argument, kompetenz-kompetenz delivers to the arbitrators under some international generally accepted international principles jurisdiction to decide their jurisdiction. If, say, there's nothing in Article five, which would enable the government of Pakistan or anyone to apply to resist enforcement of that award or recognition of it, and we will be bound to recognise the arbitrator's decision then. Wouldn't we? Isn't that the consequence?

55	p2,01:01:19.710,01:03:07.520,spk_1,	True	COUNSEL: If you start at page 67, application of the substantive rules method by courts reviewing arbitral awards, Generally speaking, the circumstances in which the French courts will examine the validity of an arbitration agreement are fairly limited as a result of the kompetenz-kompetenz principle, on the limited grounds on which an award can be set aside or refused of enforcement. The issue will arise where parties petition for an award to be set aside or enforced, and where it is alleged that either the award was made in the absence of an agreement, on the basis of an arbitration agreement was void or had expired, or the arbitral tribunal declined jurisdiction after wrongly deciding that an arbitration agreement was non existent or invalid. It was in this context that the court held that the existence and effectiveness of the arbitration agreement would only be scrutinised in the light of the requirements of international public policy to use the expression coined by the Paris Court's of Appeals. We've seen that the criticism levelled against these decisions was prompted by the court's use of unfortunate terminology regarding the arbitration agreements own effectiveness and was particularly concerned that the practical and theoretical impossibility of basing the validity of the contract on no law at all. The criticism is unfounded however, in French case law the intention is not to remove the arbitration agreement from all forms of control. It is instead to restrict such control to review of the arbitration agreement in the light of the French conception of fundamental requirements of justice in international commerce, referred to by the French courts as international public policy. Although the goal is not to avoid the application of the law otherwise competent, the expression international public policy is well chosen where the decision to be taken is whether or not a dispute is arbitrable.

If I can just have another stab, there are various ways you could put it. But another formulation is that the review relates to whether or not the government has proved, the government has to prove a negative, that it didn't consent to arbitration and whether in the exercise of the discretion, the court should refuse to enforce the award. Where we part company with the formulation of the government is that in considering this issue, the court must, not may, consider the award and its reasoning and findings and must give such weight is appropriate in the circumstances of the case in hand to that award as a piece of evidence, together with the other evidential mix and the other factors in the case. And it cannot be a just as in an appeal, it cannot be an absolutely rigid situation because you will have a variety of different types of situations that will arise. There will be cases where there is compelling new evidence to give you example in a completely different context. The case of Kanoria, which is a procedural issue. The tribunal went ahead and heard a case where new points were made at the hearing, whether the respondent unfortunately became severely ill and didn't have an opportunity to present his case. And it was late  in the enforcement hearing that it became apparent that he had not had this opportunity and that new points have been put at the hearing. And in that case, it was the only case where the New York Convention had not been set aside. The gentleman had cancer and had been ill for over a year. Lord Phillips, I think that was the judge said, that there would be severe injustice, and clearly this was a case where there was new evidence which indicated a completely different state of affairs.
